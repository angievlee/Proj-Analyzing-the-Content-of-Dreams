0,Just dreamt of the end of the world,135,dhnta6,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/dhnta6/just_dreamt_of_the_end_of_the_world/,18,"I just woke from an insanely realistic dream about the end of the world, and I wanted to share it while it’s still fresh. It didn’t involve me but was more like watching a movie, which was odd to me also.

It started at a Fourth of July parade in small town, USA (didn’t recognize the street, just was a generic small town Main Street similar to my own). As the parade was going by, these mutant/zombie creatures came and started attacking. In my dream they were referred to as zombies, but they weren’t the typical zombies most picture. They were regular people, who were changed by some chemical/pollution issue-it wasn’t explained much, just that a common product had this chemical that caused it so it was worldwide-and would cause them to develop these tumors on their faces, but otherwise they looked normal. They also were super fast and strong, and would just kill whoever was in their path, but were very hard to kill themselves.

So the zombies descend on the parade, just grabbing people and ripping them apart as everyone scatters. A group of 12 people run and hide in a neighbors bunker, the neighbor is a scientist who had predicted an extinction level event was coming, and was prepared. He  worked for the government, and shared they had nuclear bombs stationed around the world to wipe the population if it came to it. He just had to get to his building downtown in the city to set them off. He said there was also a rocket there they could all fit in to take them off of earth to avoid the destruction.

The neighbors agreed to help him in exchange for seats on the rocket, and they headed out. There were some random scenes of different people in the group trying to drive, getting attacked, and basically being picked off one by one. There’s four that get to the building, the scientist, his adult son, and two women from the neighborhood. They needed to take this elevator down into the earth, but the zombies were getting stronger/faster/smarter, plus the military was setting off bombs of their own, and the women both ended up sacrificing themselves to help the scientist and his son escape.

Eventually, the son sacrificed himself, although the scientist was against it, but the son had trapped him in the elevator. The scientist makes it down to set off the bombs, and you see him take off while watching the earth explode all over into mushroom clouds.

Then it’s back to small town, USA, the parade, and everything looks the same. The scientist is walking and runs into the two women, who remember everything with the zombies, and ask him what happened after they died. The scientist pulls out a sketchbook, and shows the earth for the past millions of years, going through the same rebuilding process-dinosaurs, first man, everything the same. He was frozen on the rocket, but would unfreeze to check on earth, and draw what he saw. History went exactly the same, leading up to that point at the parade, and the women get worried and ask if the earth just keeps going through this continuous loop of building, destruction, and rebuilding? Then they start hearing the screams...

That’s when I woke to my alarm, it was so real I had to write it down. There were some smaller character stories involved too, like the son had a drug problem but chose to help his dad over drugs he found, etc, so it was really detailed, like a movie. I did watch American Horror Story Apocalypse a few weeks ago, which I think added to some of the detail (like the zombies), but the story was different. Otherwise I can’t think of anything that might’ve influenced the dream or story. I think the details and time progression are what was weird to me, my dreams are usually all over the place. I welcome any thoughts anyone has, thanks!

TLDR:  I had a realistic, movie like dream of a zombie attack on the world, and the journey of a scientist and his neighbors to nuke the planet. History then repeats and they end up back in the same place and time.",1571071520.0

She'd been beaten to death with a dumbbell a few minutes ago, and I was the last one to see her. I was so confused, because I hadn't even spoken to her. The cop didn't care and I was taken to the police department from ""Psych."" I was interrogated for an entire week and made good friends with some of the cops.

I found this sub through google in search for answers for the nightmare i had, or if i even can call it nightmare anymore.

The dream was like any normal person would have, dreaming of a walk in the city, driving your dream car or being the superhero. Mine was simple, a normal walk in the park that i usually would visit when i was young, then it smudged into me walking into the apartment complex entrance - i checked the postbox if postman dropped any letters and then began to walk towards the elevator. The elevator was close the a backdoor entrance which was en-glassed and was about 5 steps away. But then it became all dark and gloomy, and out of nowhere, there was a humanoid shape behind the glass, i could feel the panic arise like, the unshakable feeling of fear, i begun to run to the opposite way of the backdoor but then - from out of nowhere those emotions disappeared - and i saw myself running to the backdoor - forcefully opening it open - grabbing the humanoid shadow(?) and started to rip its clothes off (?) - like i was shaken up of what i was doing - like i had no control whatsoever, as if i was watching a movie. When i(?) ripped off its clothes i started to lick the body of the shadow furiously, making my way to its face (even if it had a face) and started to french kiss it, and next thing i see is that i was chasing that shadow  By that time that world started to fade and i woke up quickly, jumped out of my bed and just stared into my empty room as to confirm that i was indeed at home. I felt so disgusted, the real emotions were just ... it was utter disgusting of what i did to that shadow.

I tried research this type of dream in the google, but with no success, so i am here and writing this -  trying to find and explanation to this type of dream, or nightmare.",1571104819.0

I was scared he'd break the door down if I made a sound so I quetly unpacked the overnight bag I had with me and prepared to spend the night in the bathroom.

I started to cry and a couple hours passed, then all the sudden the door opened and I was terrified but a little boy walked in. He was my son and he said ""mommy you never came home so I told them you were in here."" Initially I thought ""why the hell would you do that?"" But as it turned out, the man outside the bathroom door all night was a human and had been fighting off zombies to protect whoever was in the bathroom. Then I woke up.

6,"I dreamt of winter, it was creepy and lonely and too real to be a dream.",1,dhvzi9,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/dhvzi9/i_dreamt_of_winter_it_was_creepy_and_lonely_and/,0,"I wasn't home, I was somewhere I didn't know. It was snowing a lot, and in the news, they were warning people not to go outside. They were saying that when it snows, people start to get overwhelmed by loneliness and they wander off into the woods and end up hanging themselves using their own scarfs and they’ve already found bodies. When I heard that, I could suddenly see them.. like I already knew how they looked like, they were everywhere.. just people being hung from their scarfs on these empty trees. It was so fucking many people, as far as the eye can see, just people wearing winter coats and boots and hanging from trees by their scarfs. The snow was everywhere and there was fog all around them and I remember thinking ""please just ignore it, ignore it, ignore them"" but the image of them is so vivid even if I'm awake right now, I can see them and they all looked so.. emotionless (?) .. like this was normal and expected and they looked like they were sick, there was so much of them, just hung around every tree.

Then, I was suddenly in front of this old box tv, and this weirdly happy/optimistic news guy was on, he was walking backwards and bumped into something. A shit load of snow started falling on him and he kept saying ""it’s ok, don’t get engulfed by the fog, don’t panic, don’t follow the fog"" but I was already in a pond with a girl and there was a lot of fog and she was trying to get to the woods (they looked so empty, the trees where dead and they were FULL of fog and it was  so cold and grey) but because it was foggy there I didn’t wanna follow her but I didn’t want her to end up killing herself so I kept trying to pull her away. I could see her walking towards it but I couldn’t do anything and started thinking about what will happen to her. I started imagining her being hung by her scarf and I just started feeling so like.. bad and alone and panicked and I didn’t know what to do, but the place was so big and white and I was like.. so lost? I didn’t know where to go, I just kept thinking I didn’t want her to leave. 

Suddenly, I could remember the guy saying to not follow the fog but I was like.. fuck, I don't know WHAT ELSE to do, so I just .. started getting courage (or telling myself to) and I was saying ""its ok, I won’t die like them, it’s ok, I just need to get her and leave"", but I was crying while saying it because I couldn't see her around and I literally was so fucking alone and it was so scary . I vaguely remember trying to text my best friend but her chat was archived for some reason and I just started crying more cause I was thinking ""she won’t answer anyway, she won’t see it soon enough"" and then out of nowhere, I was like ""this is a dream, it’s a dream"" but .. I wasn't awake? I was still in the dream but it was like, I was conscious somehow? it wasn’t like I was in a dream anymore it was.. so real, like my brain was telling me to wake up but even when I woke up in the dream I was still stuck in that state of like panic and heavy because I was still there, I was stuck there. There was no escaping it, I was conscious yet I was there still and I started believing that it was real. I was in a pond, in the middle of snow, the fog was creeping in, I was gonna die, I will end up hanging myself by my scarf like everyone else and there was no one around to even say goodbye to, there was no one.. but then when I ACTUALLY woke up I was feeling.. so jumpy and already on the verge of tears and I kinda still am when I think of it because .. for some reason that feeling in the dream is  still stuck like it’s not like I was following the fog like them but it still surrounded me. I couldn't move or run, it was so empty. Even after I woke up, it took an hour for me to understand that THIS is real life, that that was just a dream, that nothing is going to get me, that I was dreaming only and now I am awake. 

and .. I don't know.. the feeling of being stuck in that pond, knowing the fog will inevitably engulf me, and I am alone and I know the one person who would care won’t even answer, and I just can’t even yell.. I didn't know what’s making people hang themselves but it’ll do it to me too and I can’t stop it and I can’t see anyone around me, no one was there AT ALL there was no one it was just me and I couldn’t even cry cause I didn’t even know what was out there that could like.. find me and get me. I didn't know what was in the fog that was making people kill themselves and I just felt like I had to keep quiet and shut up but I just felt so panicked and empty.. I couldn’t run or cry or leave or feel anything, I was just in the middle of the fog alone knowing it’ll kill me and I don’t even have anyone around me to say goodbye to.. it was literally one of the worst feelings I've ever felt. Saying loneliness makes it sound too mundane and normal, it was a lot worst. I still feel it when I think about the dream... I don't understand what's in my brain that made me come up with this.. I hate it so much but I am writing it here because I had to get it out.. There is no way for me to explain that feeling I felt right before I woke up, but it was worse than loneliness.. it was a lot worse.",1571111490.0
7,A nightmare I had about a mirror,1,dhvz74,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/dhvz74/a_nightmare_i_had_about_a_mirror/,0,"So this is my first time posting, but I had this dream over a year ago. It, along with at least one other I had, are extremely vivid to me, even after all this time. It still feels very clear to me and I was very unnerved at the time. 

So it starts with me at this warehouse. I was there applying for a job. Irl around this time I was between jobs and alot of the jobs I did were temp work that didnt pay too well. I'm sitting at a desk filling out paperwork for the hiring process and someone asks me to come with him. They take me into an elevator with a few other guys. I realized now that they had guns but also they were all dressed nice. Suits and ties, bussiness attire. So I had this feeling that this was a ""haha, we cought you Mr bond"" moment.

So at the top of the elevator there was a room with no windows. It was a bunch of bussiness men sitting around on the floor. In the middle of the room was this big area full of pebbles and river rocks. Everyone was sitting around on the floor kinda like you see in Japan at some meals? At the end of the room was a tall thin mirror, that was more like a window to another place. They made me sit down and then I looked through the mirror.

Everything on the other side was black and white and grayed out. The mirror was at the bottom of this huge man made ditch. The ground was rocks, not just little pebbles but lots of jagged rocks. And the with of the ditch was... I wanna say 50 feet across? But I could see it go on for a long long time. I don't know how far it reached. The walls on either side looked like smooth stone. They weren't going up at a 90 degree angle, but it was close. At the top there was a bunch of people on either side. I couldn't see their clothes or their faces, but they made a lot of noise. Half of them were cheering while thr others were wailing and crying. I knew that this was either a long time ago or in another place with less technology. Like Aztec era.

Down in the ditch, I saw three... Gods? One looked like a huge baby, but with the face of an ugly old man. There was another that was.... All legs. It was this huge mass of human legs. And the baby one picked it up and started to eat it. I remember that I hated the noise, all crunch. I had the feeling that it was made or existed because the other one liked eating bones. And this was the way to get the most bones for it to devour.

The final one was by far the scariest to me. I remember ot barely moved. It stood in the center of my vision. It looked like a 14 foot tall man. He was completely naked with big genitals. His face looked like a Chinese lion statues face. Big unblinking eyes, two large curved teeth from his lower jaw and a permanant scowl. I remember a woman got thrown into the ditch and landed dead at his feet. He lifted her up and bit into her side. Blood ran down his body and streamed through the rocks in the ditch. The blood was the only thing of color in that gray place. I watched the blood snake its way through the rocks and pass from the mirror into my world. It streamed through the pebbles and the bussiness men all cupped their hands in the blood and brought it up to drink it. I didn't drink any, but I remember looking from them drinking the blood back to him and saw him stareing me right in the eyes.


And then I woke up. I can't explain how vivid this remains in what must be a year and a half later. I was super bugged out at the time. When I woke up there was a part of me that KNEW that that thing either had existed once or did exist, Somewhere.",1571111457.0

9,Negative Dream About Buddha Statues,2,dhs9kk,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/dhs9kk/negative_dream_about_buddha_statues/,2,"Hey all,

I usually look up dreams on my own but due to the nature of this dream was hoping for some input.

I dreamt that I was being attacked by Buddha Statues everywhere I went. Each location would have at least one Buddha Statue that would wake up and attack me. I was not all that scared really but was trying to defend myself.

In my dream I said that someone had cursed them. There was also a plumbing leak in my kitchen I believe.

.............

My thoughts are:

1) I could feel overwhelmed by other people as all people are potential Buddhas, coming to me for help or advice. I may feel insecure about people looking up to me.

2) I read somewhere  that it denotes a lose of hope and a need to change my perspective. It can also mean various insecurities. I must agree as I have been having very negative emotions since I have had this dream.

3) I also read Buddha Statues are symbols of the absolute unconscious. This could mean certain negative facets of my character are coming into my consciousness and I feel overwhelmed by their number.

Anyone have another take on this dream? I haven't quite explored the whole ""cursed object"" scenario. Any input appreciated. Thanks.",1571096192.0

There was a huuuge tornado coming towards us, I remember my neighbor's house getting absolutely destroyed by that thing. I whip out my phone start filming the tornado that's literally storming towards me, I start screaming 'Mom!' 'Mom!' but she doesn't hear me and finally after screaming like for 2 mins I go to her room and told her and dad (I was still filming), by that time the tornado's cloud is literally outside the window and from that cloud, a mini blackhole sized about uhhh a bed, started pulling part of our house and I was like freaking close to the window to film it, but then it suddenly disappeared and turned into black dust. Now the tornado destroyed our house and I was the first to get pulled, my sister was in the kitchen, I turned around and could see my mom, dad and sister holding hands as they get pulled by the tornado, as I get pulled up, I start spinning a few rounds and IDK how but I got away from the tornado and remembered a YouTube video about how to survive a fall, I think I landed on my right hand first and had an wound but other than that I was completely alright somehow and I still had my phone. I go the city and stand on a spot, I look back and I see a classmate going inside a remote or jungle-ish place. I call out his name several times and was happy to see him. I followed him and asked where we going but didn't answer, there were also other people there and my instincts were telling me that this is not a good place so I insisted him on leaving this place, as we turned back and were walking away, two guys with weapons just freaking scream and jump out of the bush on his and my side, we start running fast af, they still keep coming and we are dodging their hits, we successfully make it out.

13,Weird reccuring dreams about heaven and hell?,1,dhuydh,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/dhuydh/weird_reccuring_dreams_about_heaven_and_hell/,0,"This started about 2 years ago, in my first dream i was in a very nice large house, not one I've ever consciously seen or visited. I was getting it ready for the souls because apperantly this is where we divide the souls going to heaven or hell. I was there for god (had this knowledge in my dream) to round up the souls going to heaven and Lucifer was there for the hell side. Lucifer was wearing a nice blue suit and had auburn wavy hair, again, not someone I've ever seen before. He didnt really help set up and was actually trying to flirt and distract me. What was strange was the feeling of familiarity, like I'd known him and done this before. In the end there were a bunch of souls going to heaven and only a handful on the side for hell. Then there was this little girl who was late and ended up running right twords Lucifer, NOO i screamed and got so scared because she wasn't meant to be on his side. Surprisingly he ushered her to the side for heaven. Relieved, that concluded my job and i was sent back to my life here.

My second dream was about 5 months ago, not much to tell but i ended up at the house  again and explored the heaven side. It was different from my first dream because i saw the outside of the house. It was weirdly in what seemed like a dessert oasis with a singular palm tree to the left side. It was a huge white mansion that was very greek inspired with columns. I went inside and was exploring the ""heaven"" part. There was a large pool right in the middle of the first room with lush green vines growing around the walls and random people just lazing about having fun. That room reminded me of a tropical jungle. In the dream i knew i wasnt meant to be at the house at the time so i was sneaking around i felt like i was looking for something or someone and ended up searching for a way to get to the hell side as well but never found it.

And lastly the reason im writing this in the first place was my dream about 3 nights ago. I was talking to my sister and told her very confidently ""you have your music and art thats what you're supposed to do. This thing with the house and the souls thats what I'm supposed to do i know it"" which is crazy. What does this even mean? I'm not a religous person at all. I am spiritual and have my own beliefs but these dreams dont even go along with those. I just dont understand how ""I"" would know thats what im supposed to do or even what that means.

If anyone has any thoughts or even reads this long mess I'd appreciate it. Is my higher self trying to tell me something? Am i just crazy? Why do i keep dreaming about this?",1571107318.0

Waiting room of someplace.  Fireplace, chairs, windows to the night sky.

Man, older than I am, explaining something about a person who was killed.

He had a small, hand carved, icon, wooden, of the man.  Crown of thorns, stake through the stomach.  Staked to a tree.  The man said something about being able to use his feet, but his arms were worthless.

The man wanted some of my blood.
Showed me a mostly empty vial, what looked like pink sugar water.  Said he needed more.

I asked why, he wouldn't tell me.
I asked if I could have some too, he said no.

He wanted my son's blood as well.  A young boy was there.

A woman was there, she was with me.

Acted like a VR headset.

(Some lengthy examples follow),1,dhumdq,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/dhumdq/tldr_how_to_stop_chronic_nightmares_some_lengthy/,2,"I have nightmares almost every single night (I have ptsd so I’m not sure if that is related to me having the nightmares or not) and I’m going nuts because of it.  This has been going on for quite some time now and I feel like I can’t get any real sleep.  Sometimes I fear going to bed and stay up just because I don’t want to handle another nightmare.  Sometimes I scream in my sleep, normally because I can actually feel the pain of what’s happening to me in the nightmare (being shocked/stabbed/ect.).  It’s always random; from being killed, me killing someone, zombies, being eaten alive by dinosaurs, creatures stalking me, you name it.  (At one point I had creepy nightmares that would link together to the old ones-each as horrifying as the next.  Such as being stuck in a house with a man with a shotgun and his crazed girlfriend in a house littered with beer bottles and cigarette ash and dead bodies.  They were pacing waiting for something but I had no idea what was going on or who they were.  And a fetus twitched and breathed on a table in the middle of the room surrounded by cigarette butts and blood.   Just a small sample of it.  A mild nightmare compared to some of my others but kinda weird.) 
So anyways!  
Does anyone have advice for how to get rid of these nightmares?!  I never feel rested and hate going to sleep because of them.  I’ve tried teas, putting smells on my pillow like lavender and honey, seeing a therapist, medication and nothing seems to work so far!  I’m getting desperate 😅",1571105915.0

19,A dream within a dream??,2,dhr2y7,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/dhr2y7/a_dream_within_a_dream/,0,"I’ve been having weird dreams that I actually remember for a few years now, but this is the craziest dream I’ve ever had.

All the movie theater parts are lucid- I felt like I was actually there, chose my own seat, could say what was on my mind and so on, the other dream was a normal dream.

I walk into a movie theater and the lights are low. A bunch of people from my school are there, acquaintances mostly. Apparently the movie they are about to play is ninja warrior, it’s on the physics final so people want to see it. I fall asleep during the movie, and start dreaming. 

I am a mountain on an island. It’s like I’m the God of the island because my moods control what happens on the island. I go through many different “seasons” of moods, and the island changes accordingly, but then it stops changing with my mood. The rest of the dream is from the perspective of the Mountain, because that’s who i was. 

A bunch of characters are introduced and they all fly into the island. First it’s dragon tales, they turn into scooby doo. I remember laughing at this part of my dream while half-asleep in the movie theater.
The characters mentioned earlier become irrelevant as now the island is mostly inhabited by people. It becomes an escape for a lot of people, for those who weren’t happy with their old lives come to the island to get a new start. 

A princess does this, and she somehow gets married off. Her to be husband’s clan come to take her away in a fleet of like 30 boats. They say she can’t bring something she really wants to keep with her. She is instantly reluctant to go, and even though she’s still on the pier, she’s in their boat so she can’t get off. They don’t let her go and the fleet of boats starts sailing away. 

The island residents get protective of the princess, they get the boats to stop so the chief of the boat people (the princess’s groom to be) and the island’s chief talk. The boat dude says that the princess can be returned if the boat people’s guardian animals (tiger) can patrol the island instead of the island’s guardian animals (cheetah). I explicitly remember the scene where the chief is standing facing the water, and the boats are coming back toward him to return the princess and release the tigers. 

As soon as the tigers are released, the island people decide that they need to protect their cheetahs, a fight between the cheetahs and tigers ensues. I vividly remember the cheetah running towards me with fear in its eyes as a tiger is following it, but the chief of the island comes in the middle and kills the tiger. Last scene on the island is of the cheetah looking at the chief thankfully but the battle is still going on in the background. 

I wake up in the movie theater and at this point the credits are rolling for the ninja movie. The person next to me asks me “you ight bro??” Apparently I was laughing in my dream, and then I got really serious and scared while in the movie theater. Then I woke up irl...

The basement was reminiscent of a cave. Deformed people with extra limbs and strange features were everywhere. It looked like a scene from the nightmare before Christmas. I observed for a moment, then, I released the beer. We all began to party together down there and I was having a blast. I knew that we were all equally strange and it was beautiful in a way. That’s when I began to get angry that we were forced to remain in the basement. Why should we not be able to have a nice environment to party in? Why are we separated from the “beautiful people” who we all knew were only beautiful because the owner of the house decided they were. I broke the bottle in my hand and the rest followed. We were going to climb up those stairs and take the surface for ourselves. That’s when things got violent. As soon as the basement door opened, all hell unleashed on the surface dwellers. It was bloody, it was mayhem, and it was war. We took over the whole house, and we then partied like there was no tomorrow. It was a fantastically strange scene.",1571098534.0

All of them, except the last one, are ones which I am 100% positive that I haven't been to or seen in my waking time. 

Makes me always wonder why the same places keep coming again & again in my dreams :(

Also, to add, I never used to dream earlier (exhausted from work) and used to sleep like a rock. But offlate, in recent 4-5 years, I have started dreaming, but I never remember them after waking up (or after few moments of waking up), how ever hard I try to recollect them.

If the glasses are just being rotated, not shuffled, that doesn't actually make any sense, they'd just wind up touching the same glasses, but that's a logical detail I was too, well, asleep to catch onto at the time.

So everyone would pass their glass to the left. And while we were passing them, we would chant, ""pizza pasta put it in a cup, there's no alcohol the kiddies drank it up""

Last night I had a few dreams 3 different dreams to be exact. But the last one I had woke me up and had me crying. 
I woke up this morning around 6:45 and shortly after I started crying from the emotions I had running through me thinking about the dream. 
I had been in a dorm/apartment partying and having fun, drinks were involved if I remember correctly, while I was at the party I met a girl that I enjoyed being around and talking to. A little bit of time goes by inside the apartment and me and a couple of people leave to go and do other things, I asked the girl if she would like to come with us, she said no that she wants to continue to stay at the party and do whatever was going on (most likely just drink and party) in the dreams seems to me that it was a few hours later me and the people that left are heading back to the apartment/dorm where the party was, and when we get there their is ambulance police and everyone that was in the party is now outside the apartment/dorm,  
I go inside to find out what’s going on and the girl that I liked and I asked to go with me was on the floor. she had been raped and drugged, but no one was in the cop cars detained or anything they didn’t know who did it, they take her away in the ambulance and the next morning everyone is at school/college talking about it. While I’m in class someone is talking to me (not sure if friend or random class mate) but they tell me that she’s going to make it and is responsive in the hospital, I enjoyed her presence while we were at the party so I was filled with joy, I was going to go and talk to her at the hospital, and then I wake up around 6:45 and I get overwhelmed with emotions and that’s when I started crying.

I was walking over to a bus stop, and I got shot, in the shoulder first, the pain was horrible, then I got shot in the belly. I feel down to the ground laying face up, and just looked up into the sky. Then I got shot in the face, throug my open mouth, and out my cheek. I could taste the warm blood... A nurse came, but I think she was with the shooters, she looked at me and told me there was nothing she could do. I made her call my mother and put the phone to my ear, and told her to come. She said she was busy. After laying on the ground for 12 hours in horrible pain, she arrived, she ran over and held my hand. That's when I died, I woke up. I was sweating and started to cry, I've never cried as much as I did that night. I texted my boyfriend, told him about the nightmare, and don't remember what happened afterwards. Later that day I told my grandmother, and she asked me ""well, don't you think you got that nightmare because you are scared of being left alone"". That made me think.
I've recently moved into my own apartment(in july), and my mom gave birth to a baby boy in August. I'm so scared of not being my mother's little girl anymore, and scared of being forgotten.  I also have anxiety, I'm very scared about dying. That nightmare was my two worst fears, dying and being left alone.

i don’t have bad dreams often. the last one i remember was from last october actually. that one began as a normal dream but i heard a random aggressive voice say “wake up right now and look at your closet.” that voice wasn’t heard before during my dream, but it freaked me out. of course i did immediately wake up and stare at my closet. nothing there lol. 
today my dream took place in a random hs gymnasium. there was many people from my hs (not in hs anymore) and new faces. i sat at the top in the back of the bleachers. there was a couple arguments between me and some people.  meaningless bickering really like “don’t sit there” and “you’re in my way” type. anyways they(idk who) began playing movies on a large screen. after the first movie ended i began a casual conversation  with people around me. during our conversations they started playing the second film.  we all were still talking and a girl from the conversation group next to us says aloud “i hate this part” and turns around covering her eyes. there’s a baby on screen and a balloon pops in front of it. then there’s a bunch of mini scenes building anticipation for a jump scare. after all that the orchestra music intensifies and drops and the baby flys onto the ceiling and is stuck. like those possessed demonic films. and there’s a devil/dead evil floating head next to it. and the teacher in the film is trying to save the baby.

I remember having a split moment thought of ""is this drug induced psychosis?"" (weird) and then woke up. I instantly started crying and now I can't fall back asleep. I was literally asleep for less than 3 hours. I used to smoke weed because I had nightmares so bad that I couldn't sleep but now I'm pregnant and won't do that to the baby. I don't know what to do because I'm freaked out and I used to get insomnia so bad I wouldn't sleep for days because of terrifying dreams like this.

I was with a bunch of strangers which apparently I knew in the dream. We were busy touring an area when I saw a real life family friend, let’s call him Mr F. He was obviously distraught and upset, so I approach him and ask what’s wrong. He barely looked at me and said that everyone that I know is gone, and not to go back home. Obviously, that’s just what I did. When I got home, there was a note that said something along the lines of, “Your family and friends are dead, now you will suffer the same way I have.” I don’t know what this meant, but my dream self started breaking out into tears and crying like no tomorrow. Eventually I stopped and heard a sound. I hid behind a chair and it was coming from the laundry room, getting louder. Then, my captor caught me, and pointed a gun at me. I begged for my life, saying that he and I should talk. He ended up not shooting me, but forced me to do stuff with him like watch TV. I asked if I could be excused, and he said sure. I ran up to my room, locked the door, and pressed the emergency SOS button on my Apple Watch, and made a 911 call. Right after I gave the address of where I was, I had to end the call because he was coming. Not suspecting anything, he told me my bedtime was 3 AM, which was kinda funny to real life me. I rushed downstairs to the door, and saw the police and fire department was arriving. I rushed outside, and the police rescued me. They ended up arresting the guy, and the chilling thing my captor said to me was that everyone involved will suffer the same way my family did. What shocked me the most about this dream was not my family being killed, but the extreme detail of it. From the exact location of the furniture of my house, to my Apple Watch and phone, and to the freaking K-9 units that came with the police. Anyways, do you guys know why this dream was so detailed? Or what this dream could mean? Any possible interpretations of this horrifying dream?",1571078373.0

*Why do most people only paint the sky blue?*  
*When in fact, the sky is more than blue*  
*It could be pink, red, green, anything else other than blue.*

Something like that but she sings some of the words sometimes. 

Then i realized, i was part of the stage crew. So i went backstage and i found Billie, crouching with a microphone.  
I approached her and I told her that i appreciate her music and her art. She just ignored me and went out the stage to make an appearance. 

Then, as I look within the crowd, the real Billie was undercover with a camera taking photos of the fake Billie. And i thought to myself, is this some sort of message? Is she trying to prove a point or convey a message?   
She was wearing her Bellyache outfit.

49,Just had a strange nightmare,1,dhogcu,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/dhogcu/just_had_a_strange_nightmare/,0,"I was dreaming of walking home after... something like work or school. Not sure exactly which one it was.

Well, instead of doing it like any normal person would, I somehow could smell the way home. No matter where I was I could somehow smell the way home and know where to go. At that point my thought was that only I could smell the way towards my home.

While walking home I realized that the way I went home was somehow different than before. However, my trust in my ability led me to blindly follow the way. During that time I also walked through others private property.

I also came across some cros between a siberian husky (physique) and a german shepherd (colors) that looked like it practically screamed loyality and came to trust it. I can't remember what exactly happened, but I think the dog was a stray, but I left it behind.

Then I suddenly came infront of a dog. It was a plain and simple white dog and looked quite similar to a pug, or maybe a boxer? It just sit there and stared at me. But somehow I knew that it was the boss and some evil thing that somehow manipulated the smell that I thought only I could smell and baited me there. So I did what every brave person does: run for my life.

My goal was one of the private properties I illegally walked through that I knew wasn't locked. I wanted to hide there. Thankfully the evil pug send only one of its weak subordinates after me to kill me. So when I arrived at the private property I found the loyal dog and together with it I defeated the dog that was sent after me, killing it. Sadly the dog was wounded by it, and I was quite exhausted.

So I went into the private property and helped the dog bath. I myself also got naked. During that time I also knew that this wasn't the end and was somewhat panicky. Finally I did what any sane person would do: Call the cops.

And here comes the probably most embarassing moment... When I called I was so freaking scared I couldn't say anything. It took me like 10 seconds to somehow be able to whisper ""help"". After giving the cop the silent treatment for something that seemed like an eternity I finally managed to calm down and speak coherrently. Telling them that I didn't know where I was and broke into the property due to being scared for my life and that some dogs were hunting me down.

And here comes the probably most embarassing moment... The owner comes home and realizes that someone broke in. The thing is... I was still washing the dog and am naked, which isn't the best thing. The owner was an ""old"" lady, looked like something like 60. So she had some short grey hair, but she was physically still fit. I can't remember exactly how I calmed her down and convinced her that I wasn't a threat, but I think I somehow hid below a blanket.

After some time I just suddenly realized that the evil dog send more of its underlings. Together with my loyal dog we fought against them. Not sure whether it was 1 or 2, but if there were 2 then the second got done in pretty fast. The issue was the last one, the strongest subordinate of the evil pug: a dobermann. I called it the ""old dragon"", cause it was so strong... I tried to attack it with my feet, kicking it in the head, but it somehow managed to use its head to catapult me a few meters through the air. Yup, it was just that strong. I was getting exhausted, while loyal dog was getting wounded when finally the police arrived.

Out of the police car 2 officers came. They looked like young adults, with short hair, but that was all I remember. One of them came forward, obviously underestimating the old dragon, and starting a fight against it, looking very confident. Well, for 10 seconds, that's when the panic set in. Luckily he was well trained and better at wrestling with dogs than me, so he managed to pull his gun out and after a short fight with his safety shot the dog in its head. This was the momemnt I finally felt save and woke up.

I didn't watch any horror movies, or anything where being hunted was part of it and didn't even play or read any games related to that. I also have no dog, nor much knowledge about dogs and only knew the names through google as it showed me a list of several dogs. The reason why I knew their looks is pretty much the same as everyone else would, cause living without seeing dogs either in real life by people walking their dogs or over the internet, or even in games is pretty much impossible. There was also nothing special about dogs in my life for literally years. I've seen dogs being with their owners many times, but had no interaction with them. The only reason I could think of was maybe some dogs barking outside my home as I dream came at around the time of the normal morning walk for dogs. (I know that cause I woke up around 2 hours earlier) The dream really came out of nowhere.",1571076168.0

55,What does this mean?,1,dho728,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/dho728/what_does_this_mean/,0,"I just woke up from this nightmare. Lots I could go through, but I’ll list a few key elements of this story/what happened:

1. really like girl/talking to girl
2. girl sent me message in French in which she replied with “je ne sais pas” in part of her message somewhere; reminds me of this song
3. as I’m heading to bed, I contemplate messaging her back and asking if she wanted to chill the next day, but I don’t want to seem desperate. Decide not to
4. I feel accomplished. Like at the beginning of that day I felt so unable and hopeless as to reconnecting with this chick, and by the end of it I already know that I have another shot with her and that everything is good. I think that if I can get her this quick I can get anybody (narcissistic)
5. so I’m heading to bed and the house I’m in is new as in just moved there and it’s kind of spooky 
6. tell myself I’d even face the scariest of demons/ghosts just to be able to follow through with this girl
7. as I’m walking to bed I turn corner and at corner opposite of me near bed I see this face with orange eyes hanging head low around corner. I look away and look back quickly and now he’s looking at me, grinning and wearing a fedora type hat
8. scream for mom. Then I wake up

After waking up, I Google the song that I was reminded of in my dream after that girl sent me a message in French. There’s a line in this song where it goes “sandpaper kisses, papercut bliss...” alluding to the idea of something starting out pleasureful, but ending up being painful. I could relate this to a past relationship of mine, and how it started out just as how I felt like that relationship was going to start out in my dream, but then never ended up working out at all in the end. The song (titled The Birds, Part 2 for anyone interested), also heavily references the idea of being a “bird”; a free and unrestrained individual, travelling from one woman to the next, unable to commit to a real relationship. I know it sounds stupid... and maybe I’m looking into it way too hard, but I feel as if this dream ties into real life stuff. I feel like that ghost at the end was a *haunting* reminder of not being able to commit to a girl and take on the responsibility of commitment of a real relationship. Also the “I could have any girl if I’ve got her” idea plays into the subconscious thought of doubting myself being able to commit and things possibly going awry if I ever went anywhere with her that maybe I’d end up drifting away and cheating or something. (I don’t know if these worries still apply as much as they used to to me, I feel more confident now but yeah).

I haven’t been in a relationship since I was like 17 (22 now), and I actually hooked up with the girl in my dream for a bit not even half a year after breaking up with my ex lol. Even though it’s been time that girl definitely caught me at a memorable and enjoyable time in my life in general and I hope I get the chance to kick it with her again one day. Fingers crossed.

Tomorrow/later i will reformat it and make i it make sense till then here are the notes. Never posted on here or even seen a post so could someone tell me if this has a common meaning.

Day/bright evening in a forest/hike trail. talking to someone on a radio about what if you fed a tiger would it leave you alone? radio cuts out. tiger is on the path, i try climb a rock/hill, fail. stand still for a bit, point behind it and yell look cow.
 It slowly looks around and moves that way. I say yeah you go that way to get it and ill go this way to get it. I leg it the other way of the forest walk. Feels like im moving pretty slow. Eventually come to a river which i walk into and run downstream hoping to loose its scent. I run by a few buildings on the riverbank, come to a fence that ends the river, its back fence on my cousins house. 
I call out to my cousin who is walking to a shed with a torch(is about 12), is now nighttime. Ask for a bike(my home is closeby and all downhill) he is reluctant but agrees, we walk into house. 
He says here you can cycle that and points to a chair, does that twice. I see two bikes the first is a toddlers bike second a large child/small adult as im thinking this will do i get the urge to immediatly close the door, somethings outside. Tiger i think.
 I close the outside door in the corner of the room, lifting the handle to like lock it. I slowly notice there is another outside door open in the same corner but on the other wall. I kick it close while still holding the handle up. As i do that the door im holding the handle up opens. I open my eyes and see a fucking pitch black animal like a rabbit sitting right beside me moving around on my bed, it stands up slightly on my dresser. I sit forward on my bed, moving away from it, it is so real im thinking how did it get in, through a window? I take a long blink to try get rid of it, it is now stationary on my bed, larger more furry but completly still. I have to blink a few more times before it dissapears.

So in this dream I was on this island and was in this house on the island and it was night time and so as I was wandering the house I found this nuclear bomb on a basement with a timer and so the woman whom I was staying with told me,

""The government had no use for that bomb and had no way of keeping it from exploding so it's on a timer and could explode anytime we just don't know when so they put it here""

So after I heard that I'm like

""How do I get out of here I need to get out of here""

And as I'm trying to find a way off I remember that the blast radius is around 10 miles and as I remember that I want to get at least 10 miles away from the bomb so then after a bit... the bomb exploded and I'm like... no less then around 30 feet from it, so I expect to be vaporized but for some reason (though almost everything else is destroyed) and as I look around I see the area is filled with blue fire and in the middle of the explosion I saw this person and as everything happened I heard epic music for some reason (I wish I had still remembered the notes) and it was calming for some reason, then I woke up

20

So in this dream I'm walking to my house in this neighborhood and as I'm walking I find this wooden gate with these 2 kids and as I looked at them they made me feel uneasy but i continued my walk to my home and when I walked in it I had this feeling that they were coming to me and so I went to my mother's room but before I went inside I just decided that I had enough of it and turned around but I noticed something white and fluffy but I moved around it and went out side and when I saw those kids I decided to start fighting them since I felt like they would harm me either way and so one got on my head and then the other started to try and bite me,

but then I looked to my front door and I saw this big white fluffy girl and she started coming to me and then she started helping me, then I jump cut to being in the house and when I looked out side I could see her fighting those 2 kids.

Then i wake up

21

So in this dream the same fluffy girl is back but I'm on her back going to the mall with her, and when we get to the mall she drops me off and I get this hunch that she doesn't want to be seen and as im walking around the mall I notice this little girl and she asks me a question (which I forgot what it was)

And I knew she what curious so as i didn't want her to see the girl I came here with so I try to find an exit and leave and lose her at the same time so I try to find a way out but for some reason I cant find a exit and I then end up waking up.

22

So in this dream I'm in this arcade with my family and this arcade is huge,

So as I go around playing games i end up running out of coins and i have to find my siblings and after awhile (I cant remember if I was searching for my sister and brother or the rest of my family) I think I was trying to get out but couldn't, I'm not sure.

23

So this dream is short but very interesting for me,

So in this dream I was viewing many different parts of my past but a few I remember and I was viewing this guy (my youth teacher) in a red car in front of a park and again many others like what I described but forgot most of them,

Then my view cuts to this screen white a white/grayish background with black around the edges and I could see some words and what the words said was

She said “you can have it” and I was like wow thanks and I stuffed the whole thing in my face and ate it while she wasn’t looking. Then I took things out to her car, and after I put the groceries in the trunk, she was all like “you put my slice of pizza in there too, right?”. 

And suddenly I started to panic, but I was just like “yeah don’t worry I put it in there”. And then I went back inside and she left and I was like oh shit I’m totally going to get fired for this. I suddenly remembered that I forgot to clock in so I went to the back room and I suddenly realized I wasn’t even scheduled to work that day. Then I was like “wait, can I get fired for eating her slice of pizza if I wasn’t even scheduled today?”. 

And then I woke up and I was really worried for like 10 seconds whether or not I was going to get fired for eating her damn slice of pizza lmao.",1571038691.0
68,Sharing a few dreams of mine that I remember,3,dhi112,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/dhi112/sharing_a_few_dreams_of_mine_that_i_remember/,0,"I've always had weird dreams, I'm going to share a few I had, hope you guys enjoy the read

""The dark figure, part 1 of 3""
I was laying in my room, my room at the time was quite small, my twin sized bed took up much of the room. The window casting the moons silvery glow in the room.

I suddenly jolt awake as a tall and dark figure ducks into my room. Easily 14 or so feet tall, but no other proper feature is available to describe. It's just a tall and completely black figure.

This figure moves silently to my bedside, and without a sound, starts to reach towards me, with one hand. I suddenly feel intense terror and begin to fight for my life. I reach around and punch with whatever strength I could muster.

I suddenly wake up as I realize I had punched a nail in my wardrobe. My hand bleeding rather terribly.

""The dark figure part 2""

I had rearranged my room. Months later, after my hand healed (I now have a permanent scar on my finger from the nail)

I was looking at the window, when the same dark figure dipped into the room again. Dread instantly filling my body when I sensed its presence. This time with my placement, I couldnt punch it, and it knew it. It began reaching for me again with no sound. How does such a large creature make no sound as it moves?

Terror filled my body once again, with all the strength in my body, I kick the creature and wake up, to the sound of my TV falling off the stand, that was at the end of my bed. I had kicked my TV clear off the stand. Strangely enough, I wasnt in any pain.

""Evaporation""

After that last encounter with the dark creature I have a few dreams that I dont know how to explain.

I was being held in place with a laser, it stopped me from moving, but I could feel something else... it felt like a buzzing in my extremities. 

I start to panic, as the buzzing starts to generate more and more pain. I gaze down as I notice my body being disintegrating, extremely slowly. I try to scream but the laser has stopped me from being able to scream out, as I slowly disappear. My blood, bones, muscle, and sinew disintegrated into nothingness.


I slowly become aware of being awake and that there wasnt anything there. 

""Aphophis?""

This ones weird even among them all.

I awake, feeling the sense of dread that I know all too well... except there isnt anything around.

I relax until I see something above me slither in the dark.

I glance up to see a snake, slithering around up around the ceiling. This thing is *huge*!

Easily 3 times longer and at least 5 times thicker than any normal snake, but with a glowing orange eyes, everytime it turns around, its eye glued to me. 

It didnt feel like it was perse... menacing... more like it was guarding me, or keeping me in place?


""The dark figure, finale.""

I stayed at a friends house. It's been about a year since my second encounter with the dark figure. I've moved on and almost forgot about it by now.

I was sleeping on my stomach, which is really rare for me. I'm a back sleeper normally. 

With me sleeping on my stomach, I didnt see the figure, it never makes any sound so I couldnt hear it enter the room anyway.

But I *felt it* it finally touched me. 

I began thrashing with a desperate fervor like I didnt even know I had in me, I suppose it didnt expect such a violent response, because it disappeared after touching me.

I ended up breaking my friends laptop stand, tore apart his blinds, and throwing the pillows I was using out of the room. 

I woke up at the edge of his bed, leaning against it in a crouched position, in a cold sweat and breathing like I had run a marathon. What brought me back to reality was my friends dog, Mickey, licking me in the face.

It's been 5 years since then, I have nightmares regularly about snakes, but I havent had one about the dark figure since.",1571036775.0
69,My roommate and I both had sex dreams about each other within the same week.,4,dhhjde,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/dhhjde/my_roommate_and_i_both_had_sex_dreams_about_each/,1,"I’m 23 (F) and my roommate is 28 (M). We moved in together July of this year. We used to work with each other and became friends pretty quickly. Our leases were up at the same time and it made sense for us to move in together as there aren’t a lot of personality types either of us would want to live with. I had stayed the night at his old place a few times and he never tried to “put the moves” on me, as I believe we’re both just not interested in each other that way. 

About 5 days ago when I got home from work he told me about his dream. He said I was recording the whole thing and he didn’t realize until after we were done having sex, which pissed him off in the dream. He kept trying to fight me but sometimes you just can’t throw hands correctly in a dream. 

My dream was 2 days ago. It was hyper realistic as I had been napping a migraine off throughout the day. In mine it started with us goofing around like we sometimes do, then there were two of him, with two different versions of his personality. I was having sex with one of them, but all “three” of us were still talking. 

So I told him about the dream when I woke up. Each time we came to the other with this information we’ve had a huge laugh. Nothing seems to have changed in our dynamic, I do think it’s odd that we both have had dreams in that vein about each other though.",1571034212.0

so anyways, to the dream!

# Flare Cruiser

The dream started off with a birthday party, my little brother's to be exact!  
The sky was blue and clear and pretty, it was nice!  
We were celebrating it in the garage, where our family normally celebrates birthdays!  
(Its indoor, and its giant, so its good for birthdays down here in the south where we require air conditioning)  
There was a performer of some sort, i think it was a stage magician dude, putting on a show, and we were all watching.  
After a while, the door to the garage opened, and this man walked through.  
He was dressed in a black suit and tie, and he looked very somber.  
He told us that the world was ending at midnight, and to hurry up if we wanted to survive.

The dream then cut to the docks outside of this **giant** ship.   
We were about to board the ship, that's how we were to survive the end of the world, but first, we had to watch an informational video!  
It was interesting, surprisingly!   
It went like this:

>Welcome to the Flare Cruiser!  
This ship is designed to hold one billion people, one eighth of the world's population!  
There are 7 other ships, across the world, just like this one!  
What will happen is this:  
You will stay on the ship for a while  
You will sail across to the other docks  
You will exit the ship  
and You will walk the path to Not Dying!  
That is the path you will take.

There was another bit about the origin of the ship's name, some legend thing.  
Basic summary of it was,   
 \-guy named flare receives prophecy about the world ending from god   
\-he tries to tell everyone, they laugh at him  
\-he only managed to convince 7 people to follow him to salvation of not-dying  
and then the film ended, and we got on the ship.

Okay the ship was \*\*\*giant\*\*\*.  
Yeah it probably couldnt hold a billion people in it, but this is dream logic here we dont listen to reality.  
The interior of the ship was basically this one giant room, with a couple small rooms in one of the corners.  
Those small rooms were for the employees, not for us common folk.  
There were 6 employees, and each one had a room.  
There were three scientists and three engineers, that was it for our ship.  
Everyone else who did anything, was a volunteer.  
I hung out for my friends for a bit, but sooner than i expected, it was time to leave.

Everyone else started to exit the ship, but i guess i was a bit slow because one of the employees told me to speed it up.  
I left the ship, and walked out onto the docks.  
Buuuuut I forgot something so i went back on the ship to get it.  
Everyone else had already gone outside, so the ship was empty sans one other kid who forgot something too.  
I got my thing and went back outside.  
I think it was like a lanyard or something.  
I looked at my watch. The time was 8:30 at night.  
Despite this, the sky stayed day, like the whole time.   
At this point, however, the sky had some clouds scattered throughout.  
I brought up the rear on the line, because i had to run go get my thing.  
The line wasn't single file, more like an unorderly line, it was cool.  
One of my friends was near me in the line so it was cool, i could talk to him.  
Another one of my friends, I could see, but he was too far ahead to get to.  
Along the way were volunteers, stationed to give directions.  
When we passed them up, they joined the end of the line.

*and the walk began*

The first thing we did when we left the ship was take a right, onto the docks.  
Then, we took another right, onto the docks in front of the ship.  
I happened to glance to my right, when we were passing up the other side of the ship, and i saw 3 guys.  
They were huddling in the shade of the ship, and they were wearing robes  
I couldnt see their faces, i suspect they didnt have any, same with their hands.  
One wore a black robe, one gray, and one white.  
This is the second dream they've appeared in, they creepy.  
I glanced away for a second because my friend was saying something, and when i looked back, they were gone!  
We took a left turn again, and walked for a bit through the woods.  
It was a comforting mixture of cozy woods and creepy woods, it was nice.  
When we got out of the woods, i checked my watch again. It was 10:03.  
The skies were full of white clouds at this point.  
We walked through my school's courtyard for a bit, and took a left at the end of it.  
Then we walked over some hills, and through some plains.   
When we reached the end of the hilly area, and went down the last hill, I noticed that the sky was gray.  
It looked like it was about to storm, and badly.  
I saw that we were heading to a house in the distance.  
It was my grandmother's old house, on the outside at least.  
By the time we got there, it had started raining somewhat, and the time was 10:53.  
At this point, there was like, half the line behind me, from all the volunteers.   
My friend had fallen behind, and so i couldnt talk to him any longer. 

Entering the house, we had to go single-file to fit.  
And it wasnt my grandma's house on the inside, it was the house i used to live in.  
We walked through the kitchen, the dining room, the old playroom, and got to the living room.  
One of my classmates was the volunteer for that room, and he had a stereo.  
On that stereo, he was playing the song *The Lion Sleeps Tonight.*  
I looked at my watch, and it was 11:57.   
Outside, it was pouring.  
We took a left, and cut through my old bedroom, to get to my mom's current bedroom.  
Yeah thats not possible in reality, but yknow what? dream logic.  
My mom was the volunteer there, and was supposed to be directing people to go through the only exit.  
And make sure they dont try and go back inside, and ""hold up the line""  
But when I got there, she, for the first time, actually looked outside.  
And outside was not good.

What was happening here, and on each of the other 7 ships, was  
\-people were tricked into thinking that the world was ending  
\-they made the long journey  
\-they walked out that door  
\-and the employees killed them  
\-and dumped their bodies in giant piles  
\-and then when they were done with that, killing themselves.  
\-so that the entirety of the human race was gone  
\-so in that way, the world did end, at least for the human race

My mom had just realized this, right before i got there, so I was first in line.  
She closed the door, and was trying to bar it shut.  
The song was getting louder.  
The people behind me were anxious to keep going. they didnt know the truth yet.  
The time was 11:59  
It was absolutely storming outside.  
The employees realized what happened, and were trying to get in.  
One of them broke a window.

And I woke up!  
at four in the gosh darn morning  
The song continued playing in my head till when i went back to sleep, it was awful.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So yeah that was the dream, it was um, it was really something.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tldr: >!End of the world is gonna happen, organisation gets everyone to follow their lead, then tries to kill them all. i have a bit of a panic attack at the end, it was nice. Also there were some robe dudes from a dream i had the night before.!<",1571032121.0
76,Some awful dream I just had about dying.,2,dhgsn0,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/dhgsn0/some_awful_dream_i_just_had_about_dying/,0,"okay so i just woke up from a nap. and it freaked me out so much that i just started writing down what happened. 
my dream started off pretty normal, with me on overwatch; i was playing 3v3 death match on Lijiang Market. i was the last member of my team left. i was playing symmetra, holding myself up in the corridor with my turrets. i chased and killed their solider, meaning they only had 2 team members left. their D.va came full force at me— i de-meched her but time started running out. in the dream just then realized how the graphics were god fucking awful. like an outline of everything. but i kept playing. i had to win. so i needed to cap the point. i ventured out and the reinhardt(previously d.va idk when she changed) and road hog were chasing me there. but all of a sudden literally out of nowhere a jarring cut to a first person perspective of myself playing the game was happening. i was watching the screen. previously it was like a game recording— something you watch on twitch or youtube. i was visibly shocked by this causing me to just stop playing the game. like hands jerk from the keyboard so fucking fast. i has no idea what was happening, i was so fucking confused. then the game ended in a stale mate— time ran out. now as the second match started I noticed how the air was getting hard to breathe, matter of fact, i couldn’t breathe. my vision was also getting cloudy. white almost. like a bright light. it was as if i was suffocating. i tried to say something — i know my sister is in the next room over. i can hear her watching friends on netflix, like she always does. but i physically cant say anything my brain is too tired. like groggy. like you just got out of surgery and are drugged up so much you’re out of your mind (it’s what it felt like) i don’t want to move. i remember talking to myself asking why i was tired, i just took a nap an hour ago. so now i’m panicking but the only thing i can do is lazily throw my keyboard off my desk to make noise and to get someone to help me, but it doesn’t hit the ground since it’s attached to my monitor; it just swings. the next thing i know is in my head i’m shouting for help, because that’s the only thing that’ll work. my head is hanging low and i’m shouting for me to move, to get up and get help but it’s no use and just as i start slumping out of my chair and everything is white and blinding— BOOM i wake up and i’m completely under my covers, head and all. first thing i google is, “can you suffocate with your head under the covers?” obviously not. but i fucking couldn’t get over how real that felt. it was like i was actually dying. or fainting for that matter; and i remember everything. i’m awful at writing and describing things but nothing i googled helped. i mean this type of feeling has happened before and both times i have been under my covers when i woke up. so idk if i unconsciously lower my breathing rate, or something but it’s freaking me out. 

can anyone relate? like does this shit mean anything? my only friend told me to pray to god but i don’t think that’s it. idk it freaked me the fuck out.",1571030567.0
77,What does this bizzare dream mean? (Interpretate please!),2,dhgo5c,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/dhgo5c/what_does_this_bizzare_dream_mean_interpretate/,1,"In this dream, I was in a random house, that in the dream I aknowledged as the house I'm living in.

There are teachers and all of my parents standing facing me. Infront of all of them was an unknown woman. The dream went on with this weird dialog scenario:

Parents and teachers: Look, we found you a girl!

Me: I don't want her.

Parents and teachers: She is yours now.

Me: I DON'T want her.

In the midst of the scenario, the girl's face was shifted to Momoh's face. (The scary girl from the mysterious phone number  [https://paranormalglobe.com/2018/07/25/who-is-momo/](https://paranormalglobe.com/2018/07/25/who-is-momo/) ), at this point I started to get horrified.

Me: Get her off me!

Parents and teachers: Take her!

Me: NO! Get her away!

Then I started to scream constantly begging them to get her away.

Also, in the midst of the entire scenario, a creepy discordant music was playing in the background of the dream.",1571029978.0
78,Well that was unsettling,2,dhghh2,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/dhghh2/well_that_was_unsettling/,0,"Its all a bit jumbled... but here we go.

Dream 1, a tortue house. A young girl is forced through the maze with each room either forcing her to walk on broken glass, have nails fall down on her ect.

Dream 2, somewhat continued? Im hiding, a red/black ghost/demon helps me, but each tim he does a red/black rabbit appears and counts. I am aware that he will help me three times before taking me as his own victim. I remember laying down behind a white double door with a square window in each door.

Dream 3, we are in a goth shop, the layout is weird, you enter through one door but exit through another. I pick up clothes i already own (they were stored there for some reason) and have to mess about trying to fit them in bags.

I have a wig on that is really too heavy, the hair is styled simmilarly to my own (black with a white section at the front) but its pinned back around a pair of white horns and a silver tiara. 

At one point my friend wants to put my wig on and i oblige because its very heavy. He doesnt put it on right and im getting cross as shes getting it all tangled. 

Next i am on a bus, and im trying to get all my shit in order and maybe rearrage my bags so i dont have as many. (Random side note, the bus had a random table and chairs like a cafe) 

This merges into...

Dream 4, my partners father is trying to start a commune. There are strange people in the house (that doesnt match our IRL house) and theres weird half anamatronic people. I am unnerved by all of it. I get flash images of the basement, it matched what i have seen in a pervious dream but not our IRL basement. 

I see for a second this father figure who is drying off after a shower. I cant see propperly as i dont have my glasses on but i can see that he looks much much younger. His hair no longer grey and is now a dark brown and full. He is somewhat handsome and i comment as such. 

I am back in our bedroom with my partner discussing how strange this all is. I note we also have what double doors with a square window in each. 
One of the many cats is being loving (we IRL have two but here... i have no idea theres LOTS) i tell my partner im weirded out by this whole commune thing. He tells me its not really a commune and that hes looking to make a family and it makes him happy.",1571029158.0
79,My Strange Dream,3,dheim2,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/dheim2/my_strange_dream/,1,"Hello reddit. This is going to be my first time joining the community but I felt like I wanted to know your opinion on a dream that I had. Ill write as much that I could remember. 

  It stared with me on a ship, but not just any ship the pirate ship of the Straw Hats, but the ship was not like in the anime.  It just looked like any ship, with barrels and boxes ext. I walked up just to see one of the crew mates (Usopp) telling (Robin) "" Hey why wont you go out with me huh"" and even tho that's not how Usopp acts that's how he acted in my dream. And Robin with a blank expiration on her face just just says  ""kajsdljflk..."" I cant remember what she said, but once  I walked in the room they stop Usopp takes his arm off around Robins shoulders and they sit there quit. I lay down on what I think was a hammock. When all of a sudden someone screams out we're here, and I could feel like we were in a movie type dream cause  I could see the island from a birds eye view. I couldn't see much since it was dark out but once we got there we walked to a huge house and when I say huge I mean we where practically ants looking at this giant steps, with and even gianter...er er door. We slowly walk up close to the steps, and BAM!! someone slides open there peep hole form the door and an old women calls yells out "" WHO IS THERE!,"" I could feels my self looking down with my eyes close like {dam we got caught} and I scream out "" ITS US OLD WOMEN OPEN UP, WE'RE HERE ABOUT THAT THING"" we could see here eye looking down on us, and then closing the peep hole she opens the door, a huge old women looking like ""Yubaba"" from spirited away, which makes sense on whats about to happen next, but she looked a lot kinder. she says ""come on in."" and as we straggled to get up the steps all of a sudden we start growing bigger, and bigger and bigger until we finally where about her size. (And not going to lie it felt wired, and I kinda new it was a dream but just having that experience felt wired, my body growing and... yah just felt wired."" once we get in she goes to the other room to get some snacks, we apparently had coat and we just throw them down the room. And as she is walking back she says and she is walking slouched down "" You can put your coat on the.."" she stops and looks around ""hangers"" looks at us and says "" oh my, oh my"" in a sweet kind voice. I kinda laughed in the inside, but I told the rest to put the coats in the hangers. And once all that was finish she came back and said ""so are you guys ready"" looks around with her hands curled up to her chest. She says ""alright then get in a circle, and close your eyes."" we all do that and I could feel Robin sitting next to me, and the she says ""alright once we go in here don't get lost stay close. (and for those that watch  One Piece, no Zoro did not get lost.) But once again we had an out of body experience and we turn white, kinda like in the Harry Potter movies. And we go inside this white mist spiral, and  i think looking around floating I was amazed I don't remembered if i could hear voice but I just couldn't stop looking around, it was so white and looked like I was inside a could, but I just cold not look away. But then I look around and felt like I was lost, but quickly find the others. We land in this star way and I look down as I see a spiral hall way going all the way down, and when you went down you could see rooms with people taking care of what seemed like balls of pure mist kinda like living, and we walked down and every once an a while we kinda talked to them and I don't remember what we where talking about but it made me happy just being there and talking to them, and the further down we went you could also see that there where also black ones but they had the same feeling as the white once warm and even tho I don't think I talked to them it felt nice just seeing both black and white mist there. We finely got down to what seem to be a train station and there it looked more gray kind people where not necessarily happy but they where't sad either, I mean some where't and some where. There where kids, adults and so many different types of people there. And Yubaba had changed into someone younger looking and this time it was Mary Poppins from the new remake I think, also the Straw hats where no longer the straw hat but other kids. Mary Poppins was wearing a bright red hat type red lipstick but she had like in the movie I think. But it was black and white like half in one side was white and on her sleeve was black and so on in the other side but opposite, she also had very light blue eyes, so blue that they seemed like they where glowing. Anyways we walk down the station and she goes and talks to someone in the front, then comes back and says  ""sorry guys"" in a British accent. "" but it looks like I cant take you on the train, looks like i don't have restriction to take you down there."" sighs and looks around as we catch a gimps of some girls getting of the train, they looked like girl scouts all dressed like it too but with just black in gray everywhere even there face, no color, she goes and talks to them and I think she drops something from there hands and then looks at us as to tell us lets go. We start walking in a fast pace as we get on a train, once were in the train tho there is not a lot of people and its dark and cold as well. And just like the last spiral hall we went down what seemed to be the same, but the only difference was that it was pitch black that I couldn't see anything and all I could hear was the sound of the train going down the rails, and every so often I could see glimmers of light and when I did I could see the sad faces of some people that where with me. Finally at the end, we end up in this small room almost simmer to a Doctors office. And the first thing that I saw was a black cat plying with what seemed the black mist balls but they didn't have mist and you could see a face kinda like the black balls of Mario the Keronpa balls but more realistic and with some feel of it being almost human, but kinda dead like a fish, a ball longer round with eyes and teeth gasping for air. They where in this box thing with only one exit which the cat was keeping guard not any of them pass almost seemed like he was playing with them like yarn, the black things came in different sizes but there where only 7 of them in there and the 8th right beside them a huge one guarded by a huge dog, so huge that it just seemed like a fur all. We kept walking further and we came across a Doctor looking fella, he looked like he might of been in hes 30s, he looks at a kid that is right beside me and says "" are you sure you wanna do this. The boy looks at him with confidence and says ""yes."" The doctor pulls out a revolver covered in all black mist and points it a girl looks like maybe in her teens bold hair but couldn't say for sure everything in that room didn't have color but i could tell she was a blond, no one I new and as for the boy he looked like that kind from the ""Netflix show the umbrella academy  the time traveler"", the Doctor still pointing the gun to the girl... BOOM shoots her in the head and then pushes her down a window? to the dark abyss and then shows up again the Doctor looks at the gun and gives it to the boy and says "" But look her twin over there is not the same. Because if you do shoot her she will die"" we look at the girl laying down at a table like if she was dead, but at the same time was alive but not just there. the boy looks at the Doctor and says ""i'm sure I want to do this"" he walks to her looking at her with out any expiration on his face points the gun at her wondering where should he shoot her, even covering  his eyes with his hand. And I overhear the Doctors just say hope he doesn't do it, because if he does it will taint his ""sole"" at least that's what I think they said. but in the end he could't do it and walks away, I fallow and end up in the train going back and then.... I wake up feeling a bit calm and fine.

The reason why I'm posting this here is that I find this quite interesting and I need help understanding more about what my dream trying to tell me ( some are really obvious to me). I'm happy to hear your thoughts and opinions on it :).


So in the dream a person that I know in real life ( I'll refer to him as ""G"") that I have a crush on, low key doesn't show me attention on purpose when I try to talk to him or when I snap chat him (and I think he doesn't like black people and I'm black)  

Anyway, 🤣😅 G was taking me somewhere we could hang out so I could get out of the house of my psychologically abusive and controlling parents ( they are in real life). So when we got there it was a cold and very dirty motel lobby ( it kind of reminded me of a slaughterhouse you'll see in a scary movie with metal walls). The guy working in the lobby was telling G that  I'm not welcomed here because I'm black but somehow convinced him to let me hang out in the lobby with them. So G and I sat down and we both pulled out our phones and we didn't speak to each other at all. 

While we were sitting there for a while, I started to feel much more concerned about my safety there. Then all of a sudden these big white dudes come barging in the lobby with clown make-up on. One stood up against the wall right in front of me and the rest sat in front of a tv ( the seating arrangement reminded me of a church ). Then one of them whispered and said: "" why is that n**ger here?"". So I kind of got the hint that G set me up and they were going to kidnap and imprison me.

 So the guy working in the lobby screamed at me ""leave now!"" Multiple times. So I rushed and grabbed my charger for my phone in the wall and for some reason I went to the back and grabbed something and right before I was going to run out the door, I forgot something again and ran back to get it ( keep in mind the clowns didn't move a mussel like I wasn't there and they didn't put any effort into scaring me).

 So eventually I ran out to the parking lot in fear of my life like I was being chased, but I wasn't, it was just me. Then when I was crossing the street out of the parking lot, I noticed it was located in the back of my church for some odd reason. Then my alarm woke me up, end of dream.",1571023893.0

85,My personal experience with re-ocurring lucid dreams and those dreams affecting my waking life.,2,dhepb6,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/dhepb6/my_personal_experience_with_reocurring_lucid/,0,"This account of events throughout my life will be long-winded, to say the least, and as such, I will attempt to only give pertinent information as context to keep it as short as possible. My reason for writing this report is because I want to see if anyone can shed some light on the experiences I have had via dreams that have baffled me since childhood, and if it is possible for them to actually be affecting my waking life. While I have a multitude of other, more existential questions because of these dreams, for the sake of length and accessibilty, I will be focusing on only the aforementioned aspect here.

Firstly, Context. I am a (17)M who has grown up in a small, boring town; aka nothing interesting ever really happens. While I did not have a horrible childhood, I have had a few large traumatic experiences that, while not clinically proven, i believe have given me less extenuated forms of PTSD, as well as a history of mental illness, which I've always just repressed and pushed away as to not deal with it (the reason I include this information is the possiblity it has some connection to the dreams.)

Now we can get to the good stuff; while I didn't know it as a child, a few years ago I did some research and realized I have very frequent lucid dreams, sometimes reocurring, yet not always. The ealiest ones I can remember are reflections of the games I was playing as a young kid, where I would be represented a world with mechanics that worked similarly to the games (HALO for example) and I would have complete control over how I went about completing my objective as long as it fell within the rules of the game. These dreams would happen again and every time I would do the same ""mission"" but choose a differnet path to complete the objective. I actually came to enjoy these dreams growing up as they happened for many differnet games and before long I was able to easily distinguish between a lucid-esque dream I was having and a normal dream.

The first time I had a waking experience that I believe these dreams had affected was the first time I practiced shooting a gun in real life. Throughout all the different scenarios of dreams I have had, multiple different games had modern first-person shooting mechanics to them, and throughout the dreams I would learn how to handle the guns and became accurate at shooting them, because while the dreams had to obey the laws of the game, it was still my job to complete the objective in the game of my own volition. I never thought anything of this, but then when I picked up my first hand-gun in real life and shot it at the target, the motions felt practiced, they felt natural, like I already knew what to do, and, in a way, I did. I had practiced shooting similar handguns throughout multiple different reocurring dreams I had so for me the motions felt no different in real life.

This fact astounded four-teen year old me, and made me really start wondering if these skills I've been learning through my dreams have been transalting over to real skills in my waking life. I decided to investigate further, and realized that a lot of the skills I have learned throughout all of my re-ocurring dreams have legitimately transferred to real life. Like I said before, I was able to shoot a real gun accurately because of the dreams that were reflections of first-person shooter games, but I had also had a lot of dreams having to do with stealth mechanics (the dishonered game series) as well as hand-to-hand combat sequences. I had never really tried it before but when I did, I was able to walk almost making no sound regardless of the shoes or ground, as well as efficiently scale up the sides of buildings and such in a parkour fashion, the exact same way I had learned to via the dreams. Then, on the hand-to-hand combat aspect, I went to the local martial arts gym and had a couple sparring sessions with a a friend who had been doing MMA style training for a few years, and what I discovered legitimately blew my mind. I could effectively read his stance, see his moves coming, and act accordingly, even though I had never had that sort of real training, as well as the fact that I've never been in a real fight.

All of this ultimately begs a question that has plagued my mind; How is this possible? Is it even possible? I'm not an exceptionally talented person so i don't think all of these things are just coming naturally to me, as well as the fact that it is only skills I specifically learn through my lucid dreams that come naturally to me. If anyone who is much more researched on this topic than I could please shed some light on this for me, It would help ease my mind a lot. As I mentioned in the intro, there are lot more aspects and different forms my lucid dreams have taken throughout the years, but I felt like this was a good place to start.",1571021428.0

87,Intense romantic dream about my crush at university,2,dhe0hg,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/dhe0hg/intense_romantic_dream_about_my_crush_at/,0,"I (26F) had a dream last night about my crush from university. I haven't spoken to him in 7 years.

Basically, I had bad social anxiety in uni, he was my flatmate. I was never very successful with guys, either friendship or romantic wise, and he showed me attention and was friendly for the 3 months I knew him, which for me felt wonderful. Due to my anxiety and mental health issues I moved out of the flat early, and we never really hung out again. He was very outgoing and friendly with the rest of our flatmates, and I felt very out of place and lonely. I struggled to fit in with them, and in all honesty, part of the reason I left the flat was my anxiety made me feel I was about to have a breakdown so I left for my mental health. 

The last few weeks I lived with him, we didn't hang out so much, and I think he became aware of how isolated I was becoming from himself and others. I think he didn't know how to communicate with me any more because the initial confident shell I had put on at the beginning had crumbled and I began to stay in my room a lot and isolated myself from others. But looking back, I definitely had a crush on him and was sad we drifted apart. 

Anyway, he got a girlfriend after I left and 7 yrs on, they're married with a baby on the way (the joys of Facebook lol). The funny thing is, I don't generally think about him or that situation that much in daily life, and the experience has drifted in my memory over time. Though admittedly, if I'm having  the odd tough day of anxiety, I have a tendency to go back to memories like that and feel sadness and shame. 

Yet last night, I had a really intense dream about him, which surprised me as I hadn't thought about him for absolutely ages. It felt like it popped out of nowhere. I dreamt I had lost my virginity to him at uni, and he told me it was the best experience of his life. Later in the dream, we met up in our late 20s and he was divorced, no kids. He told me he was sorry for the anxiety I felt and that he loved me. I know, as I'm typing this I keep thinking 'jesus, this dream sounds like the lovelorn ramblings of a 13 year old Girl' 😂

I don't know where the dream came from, because as I say, I rarely think of him nowadays, especially as it's been so long since we last spoke. And I definitely wasn't thinking about him before I went to bed. The dream was so intense I've been thinking about it all day, but to be honest it's not made me feel very good. I suddenly felt the intensity of my crush on him all over again and how special he had made me feel (even though I'm pretty certain he wasn't romantically interested in me in real life), but waking up just made me feel lonely and self-loathing.",1571018485.0

It started simple enough, with lights dashing across a gymnasium floor and WWE superstars tumbling about on the hard wood. Fan, presumably, were sitting in droves along the bleachers watching grown shirtless hulks fling each other underneath the raised basket ball hoops. It was weird, but not unusual until the spotlights shone on Brittney Spears. Fans cheered loudly as the lights gazed apon her and her fat sister, the bigger Brittney. The bigger Brittney threatened Spears to a wrestling match, but she couldn't because she was starving her boyfriend in the higher bleachers so he didn't accumulate fat. The light shone on him now and He stood uncomfortably like a skinny, fedora clad, weaboo. And that he was, armed with black hair and porcelain skin. At this point reality collapses. 
     With a movement of the camera they were in a 'Malibu sunset' mansion and actively recording a reality TV show when symbolism spoke. Her boyfriend, still unnamed, says he tripped before. And without reason I was shown his experience. 
      Colors began to breakdown like a malfunctioning TV before I was shown a cartoon, in looney tunes fashion, of Mount Rushmore contouring into images of angry cartoon eagles smoking cigars, when finally they took the final form of Osama Bin Laden and other Unnamed terrorist.

I dreamed my ex-boyfriend proposed to me with a gold ring that had a large, spherical, clearish whiteish quartz ball on top.  He put it on my finger and when  I looked at the ball it had really beautiful violet hues in it and had a light coming from within.  I told him in the dream that I wanted to switch out the band for my grandmother’s gold ring band, so I could always have her with me.  I showed him her band and it was beveled with pearls. In the dream, I felt very excited and relieved about the engagement, but also worried that the quartz stone would chip over time. Thoughts? PS in real life the band doesn’t exist and I don’t wear jewelry or think about jewelry ever.  Re. context for my ex, we broke up two weeks ago.

I had a dream where i was in the town and there was a little diner, cafe place around the corner from the statue

I was there and there was a girl

Different girl from last time tho

I didnt recognise her

But somehow for some reason I started talking to her

And that I needed to go and I think we exchanged phone numbers

But I think I lost hers

So I never texted her and I could feel that I was gutted

Thats the first time I've ever felt anything in a dream

Like emotion wise

Like a day or whatever passes and I'm in town again

Everywheres flooded

Like we usually get flooded in tge winter because there is a river that goes through our town but thats down a big hill

Its at like knee level but only in front of some of the shops

Like there is a magical barrier stopping it

Anyway so I'm walking near the statue

And I see her

I'm behind her but I see her

And my phone was blowing up

She was pissed and she was texting me telling me im an asshole

So I walk up behind her

And I put my arm around her all jokingly but flirty

And she smiles so I get an okay

And I start making jokes like do you come here often and so on

Then we walk about for a little

And then I woke up

The earliest part of that dream was me looking at a large bookshelf and I could have sworn that I was reading a book, and I could have sworn I had never actually read that book. The text was so foreign to me. Then I was getting dressed up for a party at my grandma's house and I walked in to the living room where my grandfather, who died three years ago, was laying down on his sofa. I was confused because I knew in the dream that he was dead and I asked how he was there. It was kinda like he answered but I can't remember what he said but I remember the voice being exactly like his. I then apologized to him for saying some rude stuff before he passed and told him I loved him to which he still didn't actually say anything but he smiled at me and it felt like responded. Then it sort of cut to me doing my makeup and some random stuff which probably means absolutely nothing. 
I'm still weirded out, I haven't thought about him for a while and to be honest with you I had already forgotten some details about him but they still were there in my dream. His voice was also something I didn't remember. It probably doesn't mean anything but it's so weird how my dream had things in it that I couldn't remember.

I was up at the highest possible seats sitting alone. My dad was there too but he wasn’t sitting with me. He was down quite a ways from where I was.

The elevation in this venue was crazy. I was sitting in the uppermost part of the stadium and it basically went above where the ceiling was. I couldn’t even see the stage (or whatever other people were looking at) which was why I didn’t know what was going on. It was also very steep, I felt like I was looking straight down the edge of steep cliff.

Eventually this little boy comes up and sits next me. He’s about 9 years old I would say and annoying as could be. He won’t stop screaming and he’s just punching me in the head. I tell him to stop a bunch and he starts climbing all over me. I am getting really mad at this point and I hate this kid. He had a really annoying face too, and he won’t shut his mouth. 

Anyways, his mom comes up and she tells him to stop it because it’s intermission of the show and they are going to eat. So I’m still sitting in the same spot and that’s all I remember for a while. 
 
Next thing I do know is that eventually the annoying little kid is back. And this time he’s straight to climbing all over me. I am getting super fed up with him and i yell down for somebody to get my dad. He comes over into view below me and I tell him that the kid is back. He yells to me that he‘ll take care of it. 

The kid doesn’t stop though. He’s on my shoulders pulling my hair and yelling at me. At this point another man has walked up into the section that the annoying kid and I are in. He is telling me to come down from there and he will help me deal with the kid. I’ve been dealing with him for more than enough time so I agree.

As I’m descending from the very steep steps towards the bottom of the section the kid becomes increasingly annoying. He’s on my back smacking me in the face now. I’m to my limit now and I throw him from my shoulders. I was only a couple rows from the bottom of the section and I throw him so hard he goes sailing over the railing.

I watch him fall what seems like hundreds of feet until he lands on his back on the floor somehow right in front of his mom. She starts screaming like crazy and I’m freaking out. The guy who had come up to my section to help tells me he is gonna start reading me my rights because he knows I’m getting arrested. At this point I’m scrambling but I need to get away.

I’m now making my way through the main part of the stands and nobody seems to know what I did. However as I’m trying to bet out I hear over the loudspeaker that my name is being exclaimed and I am being called a murderer. There are now a bunch of screams. I don’t think people know who I am but this is now chaos. 

As I finally find the exit somehow Donald Trump is right next to me and he is telling security guards to get me. I punch him in the face a few times (I guess because I’m already going to be arrested) and then sprint out the exit. I’m just running down a busy street now and I don’t see anyone or anything I know. Eventually though I see a police car come flying towards me. I feel a sinking feeling coming through me and the car stops right in front of me. Inside is Brie Larson wearing a black wig and she tells me to get in.

Now this is the last thing I remember for a while but it makes sense because I think I’m supposed to have blacked out in the dream. Next thing I know I’m inside some kind of lab with Brie Larson. I’m not exactly sure what is going on but I have a small tube attached to my body somewhere below my waist. It’s running up my right side and it attaches again to my chest somewhere. I have no idea what it’s purpose is, or why it’s there. I also notice that my hair is gone. 

Brie Larson comes into the room and she tells me that she is here to protect me. She’s part of some organization that is in charge of keeping me safe. She says the tube is to keep track of my vitals because after I passed out I was apparently not doing well. She cut off my hair so I wouldn’t be recognized. She tells me that we have to go do something now, and we go get in the cop car. She also gives me this old orange cardigan to wear as a disguise. 

We are flying down the street and Brie is telling me all about how the little kid was part of a rival group somehow and he was actually trying to kill me. None of this really makes sense to me but I’m just happy to be safe. Brie pulls into a parking lot and tells me to get out of the car. I ask her it it’s smart to be in public and she tells me we are going to “hide in public” because they will will find us if we are in hiding. I’m not sure who “they” are but I’m happy to obey Brie as she is keeping me safe.

So we walk inside and it turns out we are at a movie theatre. Brie buys two tickets to a movie and we go through security (there is very strict security here for some reason.) One of the things that happens here apparently is that they measure your labs before and after you watch the movie to make sure nothing is suspicious. Sounds a little weird to me but I guess that’s just what they do. After they take a blood sample from me I head towards the entrance to the theatre where Brie is waiting for me. She points out that my tube has come undone and that it will throw off my lab results after the movie so I should have it reattached by the theatre security staff. 

So I’m now having them reattach the tube and I’m looking through a glass window and on the other side of it I see Rashida Jones looking at me. Apparently she must know who I am because she’s looking at me in disbelief. She takes out her phone and starts to make a call. I’m not sure if she’s with me or against me but I don’t like the looks of this. The security staff has just finished up reconnecting my tube and I walk over to the glass. I can see now that Rashida Jones is on the phone and I’m holding my finger up to my mouth in a shushing motion. 

I then say “Ann Perkins” to her through the glass in the tone of Chris Traeger. (I was watching Parks and Rec as I fell asleep last night.) She seems alarmed by this and kinda runs away from the glass while still on the phone. I’m not sure what this means but I know the best bet for me is to find my way back to Brie Larson. I make my way back to the theatre and as I’m going in I can tell that there is a panic in the lobby back behind me; they must have found out who I was. 

I walk into the theatre and it’s absolutely huge. I’m looking for Brie now but the movie had started so I can only see the faces in the audience when the screen is lit up. I am looking around for what feels like forever and eventually I just go up by the screen and look back towards the audience. After a while I see someone waving at me in the back, it’s Brie! I make my way to her and sit down next to her. She leans over and tells me that it’s going to be ok now, and I wake up.",1571009109.0

I started as a young girl (Probably five or so) looking for her dad. I was in a really old antique looking house, and all the lights were turned off.  I was hiding from a very tall figure that had no face. When I got caught by them. I switched to supposedly the girl's dad. I was in the same house doing the same thing as the girl, but every time I hid somewhere the figure found me. They told me that I needed to go somewhere else and leave. I felt like they were trying to hide me from another thing chasing me.  After a few tries hiding, I finally left. I was on a brick street and the only source of light was the street lanterns. I was walking through the street and found a fenced off ravine, and I fell (Falling is a reoccurring theme in my dreams). I fell into what appeared to be a warehouse, and a wedding of some sort was going on. In one of the corners was the figure that was just kind of chilling. I didn't want to talk to them, so I opened the nearest door.  The door led me back to the neighborhood, and this time I felt like no one was chasing me. Someone shouted my name, and I turned back to one of the creepy houses. My brother was standing there and asked me what I was doing in the street, and let me inside the house. As soon as I entered it took me to a place filled with clouds and a rainbow-roofed gazebo. I sat down in a chair, but across from me, I could see a different gazebo that looked like it belonged in the creepy neighborhood. The figure looked at me, and I felt like I wasn't supposed to be there. After that, I woke up.",1571005123.0
102,The Little Brother Who Never Was,7,dh7far,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/dh7far/the_little_brother_who_never_was/,0,"Have you ever had a dream, or a series of dreams, where you had a sibling or an additional sibling? I have, and thinking back on them, they're quite bizarre in retrospect.

A post over in r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix reminded me of a particular handful of dreams I had when I was a kid. Around the age of six or seven I started having dreams about having a little brother. Mind you, this was several decades ago now (giving away my age here), but this really started to bother my child mind at the time over the course of what seems to have been a couple weeks.

One particular dream I still remember quite well centered on me having a little brother who was a couple years younger than me, his name was Mikey, but the strange part about it was he lived on the other side of the bathroom mirror. My parents, in the dream, kept his existence on the other side of the mirror a secret and would not talk about it or would deny it outright. In the dream, Mikey would talk to me from the other side of the mirror, and play with me, but he would never come over to my side other than occasionally reaching across. His bedroom was supposed to be hidden on the other side of the mirror, in the dream. In other dreams of having a secret sibling, it was always a little brother named Mikey.

At one point, it had bothered my child self so much I actually asked my mom, ""Do I have a little brother? If I did, would you tell me the truth?"" Imagine your six or seven year old asking you that out of nowhere and already prepared and expecting to be lied to. ""Of course I would tell you the truth! Why would you think I wouldn't?""

In retrospect, the whole series of dreams were so bizarre, and the idea of your parents being able to hide a younger sibling from you in the same house for four or five years is just absurd, but there you have it, from the mind of my child self.

The restaurant was nearby a small, pretty sleep slope that entered the ocean.  It was drizzling quite for a long time, and the sea level was rising, and me and my friends all watched this professional/ hacker fish.  So then this guy manages to catch small fish, then bigger fish, then bigger, etc.  Until this guy manages to catch a freaking I swear 13 meter long salmon.  Pulling it back to shore, it’s head rips off.  Suddenly the rain is getting stronger.  It doesn’t seem much, and I expect it to stop. BUT IT DOESN’T.  Apparently I’m adopted in this story, and my foster mom screams to run.  I start looking around for some sort of transportation area,  but all of them are full.  but then I see a train pulling up in the background.  The rain is reaching my ankles, and I bolt the heck out of there.  I couldn’t say bye to my foster mom in the dream, nor the youngest one she adopted.  I looked back, and saw his blond hair, blue terrified eyes, and tears pouring his face.  Imaging Kevin McCallister in home alone crying, ( about 3”).  I keep running, and somehow end up in a fair??  I keep running, and there are these weird ass clowns just roaming on the streets, looking at my direction.  There’s no other way, since the path is too narrow, and I have to face all of these middle aged dudes in clown suits.  I pushed a clown and somehow karate kicked 360’d in midair or something and all of them went down like dominos.  I keep running, and find the stations I was previously at.  I suddenly fall down on my knees, and my pants get wet.  For some reason I can’t get up.. and I stay there.  Until something flings me up in the air like I was a doll or something.  I then run towards the station, up the stairs, but then I dive in the train car, but then the train door closes too soon, and I am sliced in half.  Then I wake up.

My dream me was sad when she returned and saw how everyone seemed unaffected by her leaving, but she also felt that she learned a lot when she was away.

In my dream, I tried to gather everyone who was in there around so I could all tell them what I learned and to thank them for letting me go on this journey, but they all disappeared before I could finish. I also thanked my boyfriend. Another weird thing is I woke up right as the dream finished. I didn't wake up in the middle of it or anything.

107,Do dreams really have meaning?,3,dh8tm2,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/dh8tm2/do_dreams_really_have_meaning/,14,"TL;DR: multiple personalities in different dreams, trying to find out what it means.

I dream, as many of you, every night; and I remember some of those dreams, at least once a month. I am not interested in lucid dreaming, or remembering more dreams, it never entered my mind, which is the reason why this is my first post in this subreddit. But I really want to know what dreams mean, and what do they tell us about ourselves and our lives. I don't think dreams are random neuronal firing, I believe there has to be something deeper to it, and I want to know what it is. Because as many of you, every night; but there has been happening a peculiar pattern in my lastest dreams I don't know what it is about. I find myself having a different personality in my dreams.

For example, my last dream was a nightmare, so to speak. There were these men (20-30 year-olds) and they came to my house with knives and they broke in. I don't remember how many they were but they were a lot. And my mother and my grandma were in the house. Some of these men stole our car and the others just started to occupy the house, looking for something, behaving very violent against my mother and my grandma. And I fought back. I stood our ground and stuff, physically and logically, and I convinced them that it was in the benefit of everyone to go though this situation as peacefully as possible. I would have never had the courage to do that in real life. In other dreams, I am not only courageous, but confident, and capable, and strong-charactered; without knowing it is a dream, but behaving like that with the internal idea that I have always been like that. 

And in other dreams I have the same attributes, with the plus of doing things I WOULD NEVER DREAM OF. I mean, acquiring dark, machiavellic and cruel personality, doing things in dreams that frighten me, and getting away with it, and waking up not knowing why I did that in that dream, if it was so real. You know, when I do this things in my dreams, I don't recognise them as dreams. They are real while they last, it is not like I am dreaming and I think ""well this is a fantasy, let's pretend"". When I am dreaming, and I do this noble and monstrous things, it is like real life. So I don't know why I behave like that. And I am really curious to find out what it is all about.

(it looked like her's) what I noticed was that all the lights were off and for some reason she decides to go inside.

I'm a bit freaked out cause the sky is already darkening, so I go in with her, and it's dark inside as well. not too dark. I also notice an axe sticking out of the floor (like someone slammed it into there since the floor was wooden) 

and as soon as I look up I see something that really creeped me out which was this huge looking bear silhouette that raced/dashed across  with these fast but semi-loud footsteps. me and my friend both go back outside and I see the exact same thing. it also looked like that it was armed/holding something sharp. and for some reason she goes back inside the house while I follow her. and we both see the exact same thing again.

So what she does is, she takes the axe out of the ground and slowly moves over to where the silhouette had last dashed over to, while I slowly crept behind with her... then after a few seconds of silence, this insanely large bear with the loudest roar I have ever heard comes out and catches me off guard badly, it was amazing I hadn't gotten a heart attack.

I was on the bus to school. I was with some people I knew from some of my classes (most of these people don't use the bus to school, but this didn't raise any red flags for me). Then I we got to a stop somewhere away from school (didn't even get there which again didn't raise any red flags). Then I was just walking (I think to school), and then I felt someone rest their head on my shoulder as we were walking. The person who is resting their head on my shoulder is the girl I like. And she is also holding my hand (I think). The weird thing is that if this was real life, I would be blushing like a moron, but I had no emotional reaction to this except maybe a slightly relaxing/comforting feeling. Also, she doesn't sound like my crush but I know its her because I recognize her hair, though I never see her face. She sounds way more high pitched than she does in real life, but this doesn't raise any red flags. Then we have a normalish conversation. She says ""Hi"" and I say the same thing back. Then she starts talking about something swimsuits. This is weird since I don't know anything about swimsuits but oh well. So she starts talking about swimsuits and I try to respond as best I can (I don't know anything about swimsuits, so I just try to ask questions and listen). Then I try to change the subject to a competition we had yesterday. (We had a competition and we won when we shouldn't have at all). The problem is that at this point, she says to me, ""Why are you changing the conversation? Why can't you just listen to me?. (Or something along those lines). Basically she was asking why I couldn't just contribute to her conversation and why don't I just listen to her and keep the conversation going. I feel really embarrassed at this point. Also, forgot to mention this, but she is still resting her head on my shoulder and I on hers. And at some point, (I can't remember which), we are in a car driving on the road. I feel like I am in the driver seat, but I don't think I am driving. Sometimes I say ""Whoah"" because we just ran straight through a red light or we nearly missed a car. So after I feel embarrassed, I apologize and try to tell her that I didn't know anything about swimsuits and that I'm really sorry. Then she is like ""ok. I understand. It's ok"". Then she holds my hand (I don't know if this true or not) and then I hold hers back. Kind of like interlocking hands if that makes sense. Then she kisses me on the cheek really lightly. Now this right here is one of the reasons I am even posting it. This right here felt so real physically. I've had realistic dreams, but never from a physical standpoint (at least any I can remember). And then I kinda blush and then I do the same. I kiss her on the cheek (and it felt real af) and then I wake up and look at the empty space to my right. I then try to go on my phone and see if I got any texts and try to do something, but then all I can think about is this. And I just feel pathetic. For some context about this girl, I thought she really liked me because we messed around this one day and I kept making her laugh and I felt great. Then I kind of dropped off a little and I don't why. Then she asked me for something while I was talking to other people. Then I text her about this thing and she texts me back. Then we kind of flirt (I've never flirt before so I don't know) and then we start texting back and forth more. I make some jokes and I think she is laughing (though it is texts Idk). Then I get more personal with her and I ask her a question (not about if she likes me in that way) and then it kind of ends there. Then the next day (which is yesterday rn), I feel super awkward and I feel like all the actions I did and she did that we found funny, were just annoying to her. I felt like I couldn't approach her and I just felt down that day. Then I text her a meme about the comp (basically saying how we shouldn't have won it). She leaves me on read. I go to sleep because I am so tired and then I have this dream. I feel like this whole dream is about my crush and I feel pathetic. I don't think she likes me anymore in the way I once though she might have, I think I am just like an aquantence at this point, and I feel like I am overanalyzing everything rn even though I told myself not to. I just feel lost and pathetic and I can't do anything except post about this weird ass dream that is making me feel this way. Btw, I also feel pathetic because instead of talking about this to someone I trust, I post this on reddit which is sad to me imo. Anyone have any thoughts about this? I don't know what to think or do about this dream and all I can think about right now is this dream, how I felt physical touch in the dream and I felt like my head moved, and about this girl I like and how she doesn't like me (which has happened twice before, so that doesn't really do much for confidence when it has gone on a roller coaster 3+ times).",1571007520.0

I was a young teenager and I had a sister the same age as me. We shared a bunk bed. I was lying down on my bed, the bottom bunk, and I must have fallen asleep because that only explains what happened next. It was all dark in our room but the door slowly creaked open and a black figure I automatically assumed was my sister went across the room to the bunk bed ladder and I heard the creak of it as weight was distributed on it but I didn't hear the normal groaning of the mattress when she would lie down. I dreamed I was groggy so my eyes were halfway open (and there is even a pic of me sleeping with my eyes halfway open so this is also how I sleep apparently which is weird) and I remember saying ""Hi"" drowsily and then this voice replied ""hi"". I wasn't really with it but yeah. I'll explain shortly. So I asked my sister a favor (can't remember what it was) and the voice was exasperated and goes ""finneeee"" and I said ""you're the best sister ever"" followed with ""good night"" and suddenly the voice really caught my attention because I realized it sounded robotic as it went ""goODniGht"" super fast like it was trying to hurry up. Immediately my sister and my three brothers burst through my bedroom door because they had been messing around in the hallway outside. I sat up in my bed and felt sick to my stomach, pulled my sister inside my room and basically told her that something had been in her bed, talking to me as if it was her, but it wasn't. That's how vivid the dream was- I was fully convinced it had actually happened. I remember being so terrified to turn the lights out later that night and I talked to her about what happened for two hours. I didn't consider I had probably had a nightmare until years later. I'm really into skinwalker lore and I know one of their ""quirks"" is that they mimic voices of people you know and love to trick you. Obviously this wasn't a skinwalker but when I read about this stuff years later it definitely fit with what happened to me. I think what scares me the most is how every detail in my dream of my room was exactly the same. Usually when I dream something things are slightly distorted but this was not the case.

It really bothers me because happened twice in a one night not long ago (last Tuesday).

2 days ago, I was facing some problems in school and was pretty distraught. This girl A was really nice and she helped me out. I always thought of her as nice but not physically attractive. But she really made an impact on me that day.

Yesterday, I attended a school event and saw another girl B. I had never previously considered girl B attractive but wow after just talking to her I found myself being attracted to her. I was just waiting, looking for her the entire event. Felt really nice to feel that way about someone again.

Last night, I had a dream that I was in bed with girl B and when I started kissing her she suddenly became girl A. It was so vivid and I could feel the kiss. I continued to kiss her neck, body and she was so into it. Suddenly, she cummed so much but it was this brownish fluid that reminded me of diarrhea.

120,He Left Me. Again And Cheated.,1,dhajzv,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/dhajzv/he_left_me_again_and_cheated/,0,"    So I(F16) don’t know how to interpret this. Let me start to the beginning. So when I was a freshman, there’s this guy(F16) who i had a crush on who is also now my boyfriend. We had this thing that we still do to this day where we walk with each other to buses. There was this girl(F16) who’s popular. 
     Whenever she saw us walking, she’d take him from me. And well, he’d go with it and leave me just like that. It was embarrassing. The fact that it happened every so often was no help either. Whenever she was around there was no point in walking with him. He just left me right there for her. What bothered me even more was how I was a second option for him to walk with whenever she wasn’t there. He claims he never had a crush on her but just thought she was cute.
     Funny because he claimed freshman year to have feelings for me. Yet he dipped on me so many times for a girl he called cute. That’s where i get annoyed. Sophomore year she’d stare at me. A lot. I don’t know why. When I told my boyfriend about it, he came right to her defense. This isn’t the first time he’s defended a girl who’d stare at me too much or turn fake on me. He did that to me for his x crush(F16).
     Now this year, Junior year, he has the same science class as her. He didn’t tell me. See she went to be fake and not even notice him in the class until the second week going, “is (won’t say names for privacy) in this class?”. He ignored her. I don’t know why but it kind of relieves me cause that means she knows she’ll be embarrassed and ignored not to take him from me anymore. 
      I also have ap English with this girl. What I’ve noticed a lot about her being in my class is how she’s trying to take MY GUY FRIEND FROM ME TOO. How much she goes for guys attentions. Bending over and everything. Who does that? I told him about it and how it seems like she seeks guys attention and HE DEFENDS HER. AGAIN. 
      Now for the dream. It started off sweet. It was me cuddling my boyfriend having random conversations about anything. Then the next day, we went to school. I’m walking with him at first. The school looks different but that’s not the point. That pumpkin comes in and stole him from me. This time he puts his arm around her. I slap him and ask him why he would do that. Then he defends himself on some “I wouldn’t leave you for a ginger cow”. Well you just did. Then he’s all following me to class trying to apologize. I just want an interpretation of the dream. Does it mean that, this is to come? I hope not.
TLDR; this girl who would steal my boyfriend from me growing up in real life was in this dream where my boyfriend left me for her but this time he had his arm around her and tried to justify and defend what he did.",1571001937.0
121,Jumble sales.,1,dhagev,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/dhagev/jumble_sales/,0,"First a jumble sale was being organised, one that they apparently have regularly.  It was so early in the morning that it was still almost dark.  One of the sellers told me that they pay £5000 for a table, for which they get back a £400 cash float in change so they have change to give their customers.  IIRC she told me that she thought £5000 for a table was too steep as she often doesn't break even.

Then I was a seller at a jumble sale, laying my unwanted items (mainly CDs, DVDs and towels, I think) on a table to sell.  But then more sellers came and many of us were expected to share one table, so I had to cram all my stuff together in a small space.  I realised that one of the old towels I was trying to sell had a dirty mark on it from where my dog had wiped her nose on it and I was worried that it might put buyers off.  But one of the other sellers said they thought it was worth more than I was charging.  I think I was planning to charge £4 for it but the other seller said it was worth around £11.  

One of the other sellers started crying.  He told me that his girlfriend Shereen (a family friend of mine IRL) had been swimming somewhere dangerous and had been swept away and drowned.  I remember thinking that she'd always been reckless and it was just a matter of time before something like this happened.

Then I was a mother with kids, planning to move to a home nearer my kids' school.

123,A Tale of Two Good Friends,1,dhac3h,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/dhac3h/a_tale_of_two_good_friends/,0,"This might be unusual since this dream needs some context for it to be understood, as it actually is a continuation of an event that happened just 2 hours before I slept and had this dream. So here goes.

Just yesterday I went to a club with a group of people I met at a birthday party. Among them were two girls, let‘s call them Jeanette and Therese. Both are really close friends and have been so for years, but their personalities are nothing but totally different. Jeanette is very carefree, loud, somewhat childish and really likes hanging around people, whereas Therese is calm, soft-spoken, obviously the more grownup of the two and only hangs around the 2 or 3 select people. 
Not 15 minutes when we were dancing in the club, Jeanette had already been dancing and making out with a random guy (who wasn‘t from out group) and a few minutes after this she told Therese that she would be going to this guy’s place and she unilaterally canceled all plans that they‘d made for the next day. Feeling sorry for Therese, I actually walked her back home and tried my best to comfort her as best I could, as she was totally pissed off by Jeanette‘s attitude towards her best friend.
Fast forward to my dream, it began as Jeanette was just about to go out when our group decided to go outside and go to the two busses which was apparently waiting for us. Surprise surprise, Jeanette and the guy were in the other bus as Therese, who was sitting just beside me, constantly complained about Jeanette. 
From our bus, we could see that the other bus has a much more... shall we say, 'promiscuous' atmosphere than the bus I was in, which didn‘t help since Therese was already visibly furious. But I still kept on comforting her as best as I could and it seemed to have helped her somewhat.
We finally arrived to our destination; a much bigger, much fancier club than we went to. We went in soon after and we were greeted by the sound of ""I can‘t feel my face"" by The Weeknd, sung by... me, apparently. What happened was that The Weeknd gave me a microphone and asked me to sing with him. I gave it a go and it went surprisingly well. Everyone‘s happy, including Therese, who was still beside me as I finished singing. At this point, Jeanette was nowhere to be found and we decided to walk back home.
The sun was rising as we arrived to Therese‘s place, which apparently was next to my apartment (irl it was actually on the other side of the city). We said our goodbyes and she went inside. I crossed a bridge that led to my apartment. I saw the sunrise as I was crossing the bridge when I immediately woke up.
I don‘t know what happened to either Therese or Jeanette as we didn‘t exchange contacts, but I just hope that both of them have now reconciled from this particular problem.

One thing that I noticed is how very vivid this dream was. I‘m trained in lucid dreaming and this was the one time since a long time ago that I couldn‘t notice that I was actually in a dream. I was quite freaked out when I woke up.",1571000719.0

I've had about 3-4 dreams of the Ninja turtles in the last 5 years. In each one they have saved and protected me, and they're the only ones that have appeared in my dreams more than once and who have remembered me and remembered being in my dreams.

I've always loved the turtles, ever since I first watched the 90's cartoon as a kid. And I've been watching the cartoons and movies ever since, even going as far as buying the OG comics.

I've felt a huge familial connection with them in those dreams, and when they do appear in my dreams, it's always to save me, and then my dream feels warm and comforting, as apposed to my usual nightmares. I often look forward to when I have another dream with them in it. They usually greet me like, ""Hey Betta! Having a bad dream again huh?""

Even the first time they appeared in my dreams, they acted like I literally summoned them out of their dimension. They introduced themselves and asked me what was going on, and who I was and where they were. It was bizarre.

But the last dream I had with them, was really sad for me, I was so happy to see them cus I've been having a hard time and I really just wanted that comforting feeling to wake up to. I said hi to them and asked how they've been, and they seemed confused, they asked me who I was, and I was really distraught.

They had forgotten me. When I woke up I legitimately felt like I wanted to cry. It's so dumb because they're not real and it's stupid to feel so connected to fictional characters, but it was like a safe space to me.

I can't bring myself to look at anything ninja turtle related anymore, it makes me sad. And I worry that if I have another dream with them in it, that it'll just hurt because what if they don't remember me again?

So, my question is, what the heck is up with that? Why am I so attached to them, why were they the only ones to remember me and remember being in my dreams, and why did they forget me?",1570983729.0

There was a hurricane in my city (we never get hurricanes) and I started driving off with my brother and dad, no matter which way we went we could never lose it. Eventually our car broke down in a plaza and the hurricane took us alive.

I wake up and I find nothing but collapsed buildings and rubble, my whole body was covered in bruises, but somehow I had survived. I decided to walk around for a bit, judging by the heavy fog and the peacefulness of the dawn sky, I decided it was okay. 

For some reason I decided to start looking for food and money, so I started climbing in vents?? I couldn’t control what was happening anyway, it felt like a video player was being presented in front of my mind. While trying to stay positive and ignoring the animatronic heads here and there, I managed to find $5 in a pouch, as well as a can of beans. I decided to look for my brother and dad, still inside the rumble of collapsed buildings what used to be a plaza. After a whole day of crawling I found nobody, as assumed that neither survived the hurricane. I sleep in the rumble for the night hungry, thirsty and tired, using the pouch of money as a pillow.

I wake up the next day (still in my dream) and find the plaza to be back to normal, and there were... people? I looked at myself, still with bruises, except I wasn’t hungry nor thirsty, I couldn’t feel anything. Anyway, I decided to get up and walk around, I was sleeping on the side of a fancy restaurant.

All of a sudden, some dudes dog was sprinting towards me and then stopped at the last second when the owner said stop... it was clearly very well trained. The owner laughed about it almost attacking me. Then, he just walked with me towards my home and we talked.

There was some small talk. Again, we were in the ghetto and I remember some graffiti being all over the walls in the neighborhood.  I told him nice to meet you and take it easy, then headed in. As I walked through the unlocked front door, I looked behind me and saw him a couple feet away still. He was in the process of reaching behind him and pulling out a gun. 


I yelled “we’re getting robbed by gun point” to my dad and brother, who were both inside at the dinner table. I quickly shut and locked the door... waiting next to it for the inevitable. My family questioned me in a panic. “are you serious?” as they made a ruckus to hide/find a weapon. The man shot the lock, and made his way in. I tried to surprise him as he stepped in and grab the gun, but he just aimed it at center mass instantly and shot me really fast one time. 

I fell to the floor. He kept making his way through the home. Somehow, I pushed through the shock/pain of getting shot, got up, and grabbed the gun from him. I went to shoot, it didn’t work. I cocked it, pulled the trigger, and then it let off a powerful bang. I cocked and shot him like 4 times after that. A couple in the back, and one to his head, killing him. 

My family was proud of me.... and all I could think about was my injury, telling them “I’m dead still. I’m a goner.”

I was walking with my friend, Kay. While we were approaching the party (we could see it from where we were walking), a small group of people emerge from the shadows. They were aged between 15-50. A guy in the front, whose hair was brown and had lots of volume, says to me and my friend, ""Where do you think you're going? Think you can go see your friends without paying us something?"" I look over at Kay, a confused look plastered across my face. The man laughs. ""What? Don't tell me you didn't know there was a cost?"" He says.

I grit my teeth and pick up one of the rocks that fell to the ground after hitting me, aiming it for one of the older men. It hits his head, and he falls to the ground dead. While the rest of the group stands there in shock staring at the man, Kay and I take the opportunity to rush to the party. The other people at the party had been watching. A girl in my class (whom I quite despise) approaches me. Her name is Lynn. ""Wow. Killing a man in cold bold? That's pretty cruel, Laura,"" she hisses. I jump at her, hitting her and pulling her hair. I'm on her in such a way it looks like a backwards piggy-back ride. I'm crying and screaming hysterically. ""You don't get it! You don't understand! It's not fair! He was trying to kill me!"" I keep screaming and crying until someone pulls me off. The other people there take my side, to my delight (and surprise). Saying it was okay because Kay and I would have died had I not done something. It was self-defense. At least I thought. It was becoming hazy by now. Then my face went cold. The man I killed had twin sons. They were my friends, too. How would I explain that to them? I look over and see Andy (one of his sons) entering the party. He notices me and smiles. He walks over to me joyfully. The look on his face is describable. He was so happy. The look still haunts me. The pure happiness I was about to shatter. ""Have you seen my dad? I'm supposed to check in with him to let him know I'm here,"" he says happily. A tear falls down my face. ""He's dead,"" I respond, my voice cracking. His smile shatters to a million pieces. ""He's what?"" He asks, looking at me in the eyes. ""He's dead,"" I repeat flatly. I could almost hear his heart breaking. I break eye contact, seeing his twin, Sam, approaching us. ""Hey, Andy-man! You seen dad anywhere? He ain't picking up his phone!"" Sam laughs. Andy looks down, a tear falling from his eye. ""Dad's dead,"" Andy's voice breaks. Andy starts to cry and I bring him into a hug. Sam's face had turned to stone, his happy look fading.

This was not a dream or hallucination I felt the sensation and heard the sound.
I woke up and checked my room and there was nothing and there was no way my cat could have entered since my room was locked. I always feel some sort of sensation like something is there along with me.
And at night I would hear things dropping on the floor like a soft thud or hear my chair creak as if someone is getting up or sitting on it and no I checked and there was no way it would creak by itself.
When I wake up my lights would be closed or open depending on how I left it the previous night I think that could be me but I'm not sure( I don't remember waking up to change it)
I constantly get nightmares and I feel something looming over me until I saw the dark figure jump over my head

One area is out in a prairie in a small neighborhood. The house that I always end up in when I'm in the area feels like it's owned by an old grandma though I've never seen her and there's a large rodeo arena. 

The second area is another is like a historic down town area. Small shops, old welkept houses, and kinda packed in together. I can't really describe that one much because it's very blurry and I only remember it well just after I wake up 

Third one is a forest with a semi large house, a pretty river, and many cottages. Normally in this dream, I'm connected with the animals. When I first had this dream, i was running away from something with my grandma (we even ended up crashing her van that we were suddenly in). Bow whenever I'm back in that forest, it's peaceful and has a slight glow in it.

Looking back though, the start of all the familiar dream worlds starts with me running away from something. In the first one,  I was running away from a man with another female that I don't know. I was able to confront him and scared him off once we reached the rodeo grounds. The second one I was running away from a dark mass and then one moment it just didn't show up anymore. And the third one, my grandma and I was running away from the large house. That stopped once we reached the river and one of the small cottages that we fixed up. Now my grandma doesn't show up much often in that dream. It's normally me and the animals (no my grandma isn't dead either).

140,I’m either being haunted by succubes or my subconscious is a bully,2,dh4drm,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/dh4drm/im_either_being_haunted_by_succubes_or_my/,0,"So, I’m posting this cause this things have been happening very often and it has bothered me a lot. I’m diagnosed with dysthymia and one of the main symptoms I have is hypersomnia.
Hypersomnia episodes affect all aspects of the life of a dysthimic/depressed person, often times I would find myself not having the energy to even open my eyes and sit in bed, and during crises of depression it would make me feel even worse as I would lose half the day in bed.

A couples of months ago I was just chilling watching youtube and I came across a vídeo talking about incubus and succubes, which are basically vampiristic creatures that suck your life and energy through sexual dreams. The way I related to that was by the way I felt after hypersomnia attacks, completely out of energy, lifeless and feeling no reason to go on about my day; I’ve also felt like I was literally physically fighting to wake up, as I would struggle to even open my eyes and sometimes I would get to sit in bed just to feel like I was being pushed down again and then instantly fall asleep dreaming that I was getting ready, or showering.

I’ve always been very skeptical towards everything but I can’t deny that there are things out there we can’t understand. Anyways, the “supernatural” part comes now I guess.

I’ve often dreamed about flirting, finding a date or being around people that I’ve been in love with in the past. I’m not much of a H word person, mainly because of depression and stuff, but some of these dreams tend to come up a lot of times also. The thing that stands out for me though is that i’ve been actually able to hear sentences and bits of conversations in my dreams, not related to them, and that didn’t leak from something that was going on in the room (you know?! like when you dream about the tv audio or something like that). Once while I was trying to move my fingers and lift my arm during a hipersomnia crises I’ve actually been able to hear a commotion and someone saying “Don’t let her go!” in my head, but I WASN’T DREAMING ANYMORE I was just in the state of paralysis!!

So, do you think my brain is playing tricks on me or do you believe there are actually supernatural beings out there that feed on us?

The front door was locked, and I didn't want to upset my friend by letting him know that I was ready to go, as he had already made up the guest room for me. I went to the room and locked the door behind me. I could hear him coming up the stairs, and felt so frightened that I opened the closet to hide. When I opened the closet, I saw that there was a ledge looking over darkness. I could hear him trying to open the door to the guest room, so I jumped into the abyss. I was tumbling/rolling head over heels on what looked like a net or web. There was nothing for me to grab onto to catch myself, so I just kept going. I was feeling very dizzy. 

And that's when I woke up! 

Please let me know if you need additional details (room colors, etc). I didn't want this to run on too long.",1570954338.0

147,Is this a stage of sleep?,2,dh2dlc,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/dh2dlc/is_this_a_stage_of_sleep/,2,"Hi guys, really not sure what the best place to write this in but I think this is ok for this sub, sorry if not. 
Basically when I go to sleep at night, before I even begin to drift off I have this very strange 'vision' thing. It's only happened twice, the first one happened when I was listening to the podcast I listen to every night, it was like what i assume an acid trip is like, I was actually in the main guy of the podcasts mind, it was very real and scary I was quiet uncomfortable so I kinda shook myself out of it. 
The second one was last night, I was in my vision and it was like I entered a different world and it was so strange but I understood it, it was like I was in a different world, both times I was pretty awake so I don't think it was a dream, both times were quiet scary and it's never happened before, the only thing I can think of is when I've just woken up from sleep or dozing off I can make up quiet a few veres of songs really quickly, which is odd as I am not musical and i struggle to make a poem rhyme!
I'm not thinking this is anything supernatural I'm just asking for peoples opinions, and maybe it's worth mentioning that I go to therapy 3 times a week so I do feel alot (maybe that adds?) And I  on meds but have been for 4 years and there's never been any side effects. 
Oh and i spoke to a women I know who said that's (that time before you sleep or just wake up) is the freest place in a human but she's all I to witches and stuff so don't really accept her opinions on everything...
Would love to hear your thoughts. X",1570950196.0
148,My brain taught me how to wake up after a painful dream where I died.,5,dgxnwh,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/dgxnwh/my_brain_taught_me_how_to_wake_up_after_a_painful/,1,"So this started with a dream I had back in 2012 during my high school years. I still remember it clearly since it was the only dream that gave me pain when I woke up.

So the dream scenario started with a takeover invasion of earth by machine aliens, and with them succeeding. I was looking for a job at that time, and was desperate so I applied at the internal security department of the alien force. I was accepted and designated as a conspirator. As years passed, I was promoted to the head of internal security. However, a fierce revolution erupted shortly after, with people all over the world overpowering the invaders. The office compound was soon overran by the rebels. I fought hard but was soon captured and brought outside, surrounded by them. I was then executed by a pistol to my forehead. The end of my dream.

Upon waking up, I had difficulty moving accompained with twitching pain at the back of my head. This went on for less than a minute. 

I think this happened because my brain didn't know the feeling of death/gunshot to the head. That's why I twitched maybe? I had a couple of dreams where I drowned to death before that one, but I think it wasn't that straightforward compared to this one.

Soon after this dream I learned to wake up at command when I'm in dire situations. It had something to do with talking musical notes teaching me this emergency move lol, my brain don't want that pain no more.",1570927910.0

150,a hurtful dream,1,dh3s9w,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/dh3s9w/a_hurtful_dream/,0,"I had a dream that we were laying and snuggling in a sunkissed wheat field.. You looked into my eyes but your mind was somewhere else. You said, ‘I should leave, I’m going to be late for my wedding’. I looked at you with hurt in my eyes but knowing in my soul. ‘you have a wife.’ You respond ‘yes, I do.’ You left. I was angry and sad, though I knew this already, you’d ripped my heart open in confirming my suspicions. It felt like my world had fell apart...  there were tears streaming down my face. I flew away from you, an angel using the sky as a canvas for my tears. I sprayed red spaint into the sky so you could see me, to show you I’m hurt and to remind you I still exist before you were gone out of sight after discarding me, but the lines kept fading and no matter how dramatic they were, you didnt notice me. In the distance I saw someone painting yellow lines into the sky. My heart came alive with pure rage combined with comfort and grief. I thought it was you and I went to check even though my gut said it wasn’t. My gut was right. It was some random people having fun with paint.

I had nowhere to go so I went back to school. I was still crying and I knew how ridiculous I looked, but I went 'fuck it'. Fuck it not because I don't care, fuck it because nobody else does. People hide this kind of raw emotion in vain. Besides nobody could ever understand the pain I was in if I explained it, and predictably none of them cared anyway. As always even when I'm not bawling my eyes out in front of them, it felt like there is this wall between me and them. A wall of shame. I half expected someone to come and comfort me being the idealist I am, but instead people made fun of me. Some did worse, they tried to 'fix' me. Ingenuous pieces of shit. So I was just alone crying in the corner having my very own pity party.

Dreams like these make me wish I’d never gotten involved with boys at all, let alone you.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I'm only 15 and I've already been betrayed so many times in love, it's dampened my spirit.

I have a lot of dreams like this and they haunt me.

 I don't believe it when people say things... anything. I feel like people are always lying to me. I hate it and I'm mad, boiling with hatred really, that so many have taken advantage of me. I'm a really sensitive empathetic and kind person and I know that and so did they. The first one took advantage of my body and naive wonder, another created a fairytale land for us to share and had me completely in love with him, but then left with the coldest most hurtful, rude energy and no real explanation. The next guy promised to help me through the pain and be my lover and my best friend simultaneously, but he left me for work. Really, he had someone else all along and was cheating with me. Then there was this guy... I guess he did nothing wrong, it just wasn't meant to be and he was afraid because I was more experienced than him. I'm still on good terms with him and that makes my heart warm, he rides his bike around after school and says hi to me. Although, he did also make promises and present sentiments and tales of 'forever'. I'll let him off the hook though just because hes a cute lil munchkin. Next guy, well we didnt date but he was a fuckboy. Now now, usually I have a very great fuckboy radar and I could tell this guy was like that so it's on me, but there was something about him that was very creative and etherical and innovative. Otherworldly. He was different to all of the douchebags he associated himself with and I don't know if he knew that. I found him so mesmerizing. He was such a gentleman to me and treated me like a lady. He sent me red hearts and we exchanged sweet kisses, but I was soon to face the reality of his fear of commitment. I told him I liked him and he said he liked me as a friend. I was all 'what the fuck, man?' and that's how it ends.

This has become a rhyme because I don't wanna waste your time, with a boring little whine. I think all of these hurts were lessons from our lovely universe. To trust my gut and not submit to thirst. To not be seduced by those who are aloof. To recognize the liar before the serotonin levels shot any higher.

Trust your gut people.

Modern times, no super-fantasy setting. There was a huge fireball that hit some power lines and everything went dark, so my mom and I left the car, but my dad was nowhere to be seen. We were panicking, running along the sidewalk in a city, and we were swarmed by men with guns trying to attack us. We went inside a building where I killed them all to protect my mom, and their mob boss or whoever congratulated me, invited us into her house, and offered us relaxation. There was a small pond and I sat by it in a wicker chair of sorts, bending water for fun. I tried doing more advanced stuff, but it wasn’t working out for me. Moved on to doing that airball seat trick that Aang did at times. We were on a balcony overlooking a large mountain, so I called over this mob boss’s kids and told them to watch me. I gestured for the mountain to rise, but nothing happened, and the kids started getting bored. But once I got it, it was amazing. That mountain probably gave Everest a run for its money. 

So now I’m spending my day watching Avatar and wishing I really could bend the elements. If I had to pick one, it’d probably be water. What would you pick?",1570933561.0

167,The Face Stealer,1,dh0nud,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/dh0nud/the_face_stealer/,0,"Oct 12 2019

I'm in a middle school. But I was confused because I'm not a middle schooler. The announcement said 3rd period is starting and all the kids are rushing. But I saw something standing in the middle of the hallway. 

It looks like a tall person. Wearing a black outfit. A long trench coat, boots, a hat. The only thing missing is a head. The hat is just floating in mid air.

A kid bumped into this tall headless person. It grabbed the kid by the face, lifted him up in the air and the dropped him. The kid got up. But he doesn't have a face anymore. 

All the kids screamed and started running to their classes. The headless monster saw me just standing a couple feet away so it tried to grab me. But a witch outfit appeared onto my body and a wand in my hand. I blasted its hand away. I then ran into a gym and closed the door. 

Once I entered the gym my witch outfit disappeared and back to normal clothes. The gym was having a talent competition. 2 handsome brothers got up on stage. They look like grown adults. One of them is holding a guitar. They said they wrote a song to their friend. They told a story about meeting a beautiful girl. They both fell in love with her. She doesn't want the 2 brothers to fight each other for her so she decided to hang out with her separately. But one day she can no longer hang out with them because she's going home. They were in a forest at night and she took her clothes off. 

Underneath showed glowing clothes, looks like it dates back to ancient Egypt. She told them she's actually a goddess. Her spaceship arrives, inside was a modern looking bar with a motorcycle next to it. She hopped on and the spaceship closes its doors and flew away. 

The brothers said that was in the 1970s. I was confused even more. How old are you two and why are you in a school talent show? The next is a boy with his pants drooping. He started dancing but then grabbed a girl and said would you go to the dance with me. And everyone cheered. 

I got bored and opened the door and I saw the headless monster going down this hallway. I was about to close the door but the monster pushed through. Everyone started running away. My witch outfit appeared again. I ran into a storage room. Inside is another girl. She have brown skin and hair, also wearing emo clothing. She shushed me, because I ran in with too much noise.

It's a very crammed storage room. I had to move very slowly because I might bump into something and it's going to be very loud. There's a hole at the bottom of the wall. I crouched down and took a peek. It's another room, I think the bathroom. Other kids are hiding in there.

We heard movements. A very heavy and slow walking sound near the door. I pulled out my wand and whispered to the girl, I'm going to put a invisible mask on us so it won't take our faces. She nodded. I waved my wand in a small circle and started forming a mask. I told her to close her eyes. I closed mine too. 

The door opened. A slow thumping noise approaches. There was a tapping noise on the girl's head. I took a peek, it's the monster. The girl's eyes twitched, looks like she wanted to open her eyes. But I grabbed her head and put it on my chest so the monster won't get her face. 

The monster grabbed my face, but then a loud noise came from the bathroom. The monster lets go of my face and walked over to the wall. I looked over and it punched a hole in the way. There's a lot of frightened looking kids in the bathroom. 

My plan was to trick the monster for taking our faces and then leave. But now more kids are in danger. I pointed my wand at the monster and started blasting spells. But the spells bounced right off. It turned around and grabbed me by the neck. And pinned me to the wall. 

I looked at it and saw a face. It looks like a young man's face. I aimed my wand at the face and blasted magic. The monster screamed and lets me go. I yelled out nine circles of hell and powerful flames burst out of my wand into the monster's face. I yelled at the kids saying everyone get the fuck out of here. I then started the seven heavens and the monster was blinded. 

Even though its blinded, monster was fast and blocked the door. I yelled out belphagor's sloth at the monster. The monster fell to the floor and started moving really slow. I grabbed the monster not letting it go and yelled at the kids to run. They all started running around the door. Only the monster and I are in the room. 

My dreams ends there. I'm not religious at all, I just like reading mythology and legends so maybe that's why the spells are called devils and heaven.",1570941983.0

- so this gamer guy had the bright idea of putting his microwave nxt to his pc so he didnt have to get up while playing overwatch, he turns the microwave on to make some food n then all hell breaks loose, the microwave caused the pc to malfunction and all his game characters in all his games became real and they all lived in the house with him, i remember tracer from overwatch very clearly running around the house all fast cleanin n cookin n i knocked on the front door n doomfist fuckin answers the door n CARRIES me with one hand (i was sitting in his hand like a tiny chihuahua) to the couch to hang with 'the fam' lol tracer wanted to have a dance party so we all partied with her then i woke up.....wtf even is my brain.....

- ok so this one was a long one. i was at a house with ray n some guy who looked familiar but idk who tf he was. the front door opened up to the living room where ray was layin on the couch on his phone then you'd go through a door that turned into like a walk-in hallway closet situation then through that to another door on the end that went into a bedroom where the guy was hangin out. it started like i was in the bedroom with the guy hangin n smokin n i heard someone start to bang on the door. when i open the door 3 zombies try to push their way inside n im tiny n weak but still trying my damndest not to get bit. im wrestling with these zombies while the weird dude just smokes on the bed like nuthing is going on n im screamin for him to help but its like he dsnt hear me. after like 30 mins of fighting a losing battle the zombies start to laugh n ray comes through the door laughin too. it was a fuckin prank to fuck with me n im pissed. when i cool down i go throigh the hallway closet thing into the living room where i cnt believe whos hanging out on the couch. a bunch of celebrities and jason are sitting there waiting to surprise me (adam sandler, jack black, evan peters, beyonce, rihanna, that main beardy white guy from stranger things n some i dnt remember their names but i know their faces). im like omfg what are u guys doing here (i guess im friends with all the celebrities). i hug them all n ask hows it going n ray is nowhere to be seen. im like 'rays gotta see this or he'll never believe me' so i run out front to find him. hes gone. neighbor says she saw him drive away, she dsnt know where he went or if hes comin back for me so im like well fuck. i go back inside n hang with my celeb friends n wait for ray to come back. then i woke up. idk wtf is wrong with my brain but it felt so real i woke up like OoO bc i pretty much had to force myself to wake up. lol

- ok so this time i dreamed i met the rock (Dwayne Johnson) and he was super cool n then zombie happened everywhere n he was my bodyguard n he got bit n i had to shoot him in the face before he turned bc id have no chance against a zombie with his build lol then my alarm went off right when my gun shot him in the face

- ok this time it was just weird af. i was at some kind of awards show i was sittin in the audience with all these celebrities n they were all gettin awards. im not a celebrity so i didnt get anything. when the awards were over n everyone was leaving 2 awards got forgotten abt on stage so i ran up n grabbed em when noone was looking bc i wanted awards too lol then i had to pee really bad so i ran into the bathroom only to find out it was the mens bathroom so i ran back out n into the girls bathroom where the 2 girls that forgot their awards saw me holding them n thought i was delivering them so i played along n gave them to their owners then as i was leaving the bathroom i saw an etched glass mortar n pestle sitting by the door as decoration so i swiped that instead lol then i left with the mortar n pestle n then i woke up

- ok, so this one was strange. i was like at a market of kiosks under like this big dock at an ocean n jayson bautista was there with Brittney Walta and some big scary rough lookin guy was trying to get me (idk why i think he wanted to kill me) and i was running and i didnt know abt J and B being there so im just runnin from this guy and i look behind me to see if hes still chasing me and i run right into J and B and their like omg dude what r u doin here and im like omg im so happy to see you guys theres this guy chasing me and then i hear GOT YOU YA LITTLE BITCH! behind me and its the guy! n J n B r like get behind us were gonna fuck this guy up and then i woke up

- ok....omfg....i literally jumped up terrified out of this dream n looked around my room to see if it was still there...im still scared af i feel like its watching me....i was with ray n 2 other ppl who i cnt remember bc i was so focused on the thing. we were sittin in the woods (campin i guess) n we kept hearing rustling sounds just beyond the trees. we turn a flashlight towards it n see this....thing...(tryin not to tear up just thinkin abt it) it was darting back n forth trying to avoid the light then it just stopped i guess it realized the light wasnt hurting it so then it RAN DIRECTLY AT ME n we all just froze n when it got to my face it stopped n its eyes like glazexx over with like a 2nd eyelid or someshit like it was pretending to be a statue or something n it stayed real still n everyone stared at it in horror thwn it opened its eyes n threw up thia black shit on the floor n GRABBED ME BY THE FUCKING THROAT NOONE HELPED ME THEY ALL JUST SAT THERE IN SHOCK AS THIS THING CHOKED ME  it had the calmest face as it it squeezed hardwr n harder on my throat it just stared n squoze....idfk dude......noone helped it was like it had this spell over everyone or they were just frozen in terror idfk.....im still scared....still feel like its watching me....cnt help it im crying a little im legit scared it felt so real im still not sure if it was just a dream or not....i dnt wanna go back to sleep i CANT go back to sleep......im still shaking (trembling?) ikfk dude.....fuck.....my heart wont slow down......i wamna get up but i dnt wanna leave rays side (sleeoing peacefully nxt to me) bc im legit terrified this thing is real n still watching me n knowing rays nxt to me makes me feel like ill be ok it looked like this....egyptian cat monster thing....like the egyptian cat god thing on DBZ but smaller like it culd sit in ur lap like the size of a small child im still crying god fucking shit its eyes blinked sideways like a fucking bird

- ok this one was crazy af. ray got kidnapped by some like terrorists or something and i went into this ship filled with them determined to get him back. i find this gun at the entrance thats in 3 parts so i click them all together real quick and go in. idk how this gun works but it has 2 handles with a trigger on each one. i try the first trigger n it shoots bullets in this one bad guys face. the nxt bad guy gets a face full of acid. (weird ik) so i kill like 10 guys n im almost there n my gun runs out of ammo so i grab 2 big  spikey looking machete things to duel wield i found on the ground n continue. then just as i get to the end n can see ray tied up with some other ppl this mat gets thrown down in front of me from around the corner and explodes like napalm or something. i catch fire. then i wake up. i feel bad for not being able to save him.

- this time I dreamed me n ray were at the zoo looking at the tigers (one white one orange) and i reached through the bars to pet one bc it was rubbing up on the bars n purring real loud and the tiger yanks me through the bars n everyone starts freaking out n i think im abt to die then they start purring again and rubbing all over me (their super strong so i feel smooshed af) n then they lay down on both sides of me n put their heads in my lap so i pet them n talk sweet to them like ""sweet little babies awwww u just want lovins dont u) n the zookeepers r like stay calm well get u out n rays so scared for me but when they come through the secret door for feedings the tigers wont let them take me n attack them so they retreat n im like mmmhhhmmmm thats what i thought im the queen of the tigers hahahha then they give me a zookeeper job bc the tigers love me so much n their so happy to see me when i come through with their food (2 big buckets of steaks) they even wait patiently as a set the buckets down for them n i say their names as i feed them (like when ur dogs r taking turns being fed so u say thier names so they know when its their turn) n we all lived happily ever after lol then i woke up

- ok so last night i dreamed i was at my moms house with Andrew Nieto, Jimmy Nieto, Shane, Marcus Gonzales, and Raymundo Borrego and this guy was hunting me (idk who, i never saw his face). Shane, jesse n jimmy were keeping watch outside the back door, marcus was watching the front door, and ray was with me hold up in my old room. the guy snuck up behind shane n stabbed him in the back right through his heart, jimmy got his throat slit, and jesse was stabbed multiple times in the front torso. the guy then hooked up a water hose to his exhaust and stuck it up under the front door were marcus was posted, but he saw n tied it in a knot to stop it. then ray woke me up.

- omfg guys this ones a doozy bc i had 2 crazy dreams.
1. i got really drunk the other night and i dreamed abt me runnin around drinkin water constantly n then passing out. my friends covered me in temporary tats so when i woke up i had 2 full tribal sleeves, a dragon on my  chest, and a single nipple that was perfectly dipped in bright blue glitter i dnt fuckin know wtf either guys lol

2. i dreamed i was hanging out with all my old friends like Nate NM, Eric Sitton, jeremy mata, and Austin Harris n they said they'd buy me makeup (idk y bc i dnt even wear makeup). we go to the store and were arguing over wether i shuld get the concealer thats darker or the one thats lighter then my skin tone, dnt buy anything, then walk out of the store. as were leaving (abt to walk around the corner) we see a guy standing between 2 cars at a red light ( one behind the other). the front car is a little too far in the box n decides to back up. the guy dsnt move as the car starts to move, the car behind it dsnt move either. the guy feels the front car finally as he begins to get crushed n bends over n grabs his socks (like when we got paddled in elementary). the car keeps going backwards until the 2 car's bumpers r touching n guy's spine is totally smooshed n his arms n legs r just hanging there. everybodys freaking out n im standing there laughing yelling OMG THAT WAS AWESOME!! over n over. then i woke up.

- me, ray, jimmy, jesse, shane, jeremy, n marcus were all in a super creepy house where we were gonna make a horror movie. there was a man with a chainsaw (like texas chainsaw) killing all of us one by one. first jeremy got chopped in half (head to toe), then shane go beheaded, then ray got dismembered, next jimmy got sliced through the abdomen, next jesse was impaled by the chainsaw. in the end, me n marcus were running through a field with the killer (me behind marcus bc he runs faster) closing in fast. marcus then reaches back n i grab his hand, he throws me in front of him right before the chainsaw gets shoved through his back n out his front. i woke up yelling ""MARCUS!!!"". he saved me......

- ok this one was weird, sad, then weird again. i was in my old room at moms but the bed was in a different place n i was playon games on my phone when i look over n therea a guy looking into my window from the back yard so I jump up n tell mom who comes with me n the guy is gone so we go into the backyard n nuthing then ray comes to pick me up n we go driving down the highway n as were driving there are big holes in the highway he keeps having to swerve to avoid (we can see the cars passing under us) then ray dsnt miss one n we hit it n go falling then i wake up n rays gone im freakin out bc im so scared he got thrown from the car n is now dead somewhere so i call him (stupid ik) his phone isnt working then he calls me back n tells me the crash messed up his phone so he went n got a new one n im worried af bc he just left me in the car wreck to go get a new phone wtf babe then i woke up",1570940594.0

173,I think I died last night,8,dgssdc,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/dgssdc/i_think_i_died_last_night/,6,"Last night, or rather a few hours ago, I had quite an unusual dream. It was like no other dream I've ever had and I'm reluctant to even call it a dream.

I was laying in my bed with the lights off. I close my eyes and try to drift off. As I dance between consciousness I hear faint whispers around my room, they get closer, whispering into my ear but I can't understand them. I do not feel scared. Everything goes black but I'm not asleep. In the dark a circle of spectacular light forms. As it expands, it covers the the entirety of my vision. Rolling and flashing like a storm at sea,getting brighter and more fascinating. I ask myself ""what is this?"" still I am not scared. The light fills my eyes and everything is silent and white.

Suddenly I wake up. I stare at the ceiling above me. I soon realize this is not my bedroom ceiling but nor is it an unfamiliar one. It's the ceiling of my family home. I'm not sure how I know this, I just know. ""Why am I here?"" 
I try to move but something about my body is different. I feel weak and light. Frustrated, I begin to panic. Then I hear my mother's voice. I call out to her. ""Mum!"" I try to say but the only sound that  comes from my mouth are the cries of an infant. My mother walks over to me and cradles me. I try to tell her ""Mum it's me! I can't talk. Why am I here, mum?"" but again, I can only communicate by the wails of a baby. I'm desperately trying to let her know but she can't understand me. She continues to rock me in her arms and sing to me. 

I live out my entire childhood again but by now I have forgotten that I used to be an adult. That I had awoken one day as a child crying for my mother. I feel as if I've been living my life for years but I'd soon awaken to find it's just a dream. I go through my life experiencing the same events that have happened before, though, they feel brand new. I get older, watch my brother marry. See my grandparents die again. My mother and father grow old and frail. 

One night I lay in my bed, close my eyes and start to drift off. 
I feel that same panic. The same panic I felt waking as a baby in a cot. Helpless and weak. I cry out for my mother but this time I don't hear her voice. A feeling of dread washes over me and I sense something is wrong. I no longer feel my mother's presence. Or the presence of anything for that matter. Fear sets in and once again everything goes black. I'm surrounded by nothingness. Trapped in an endless darkness with nothing but my own panic. It's torturous and cold. It's so cold and I am alone. 

I scream. Now I'm awake. In my bed, at my current age. I'm crying and I feel the overwhelming urge to call my mother. I check to see I haven't been unconcious for decades but had only been sleeping for around 45 minutes. 

Now, I dream quite vividly and often. I have experienced MANY types of dreams, nightmares, sleep paralysis, hypnagogic hallucinations, you name it. Even as a child I would apparently have premonitions. I am also quite an experienced lucid dreamer and have been doing it for many many years. I can usually wake from a dream and feel certain of my self exactly what kind of dream it was and can shake any feelings of discomfort fairly easily. 

This dream felt unreal. Like it wasn't a dream. I actually feel as if I was in there for my entire life. I am genuinely shook up by this ""dream"". I tried to speak to my dad about it when I woke up and the best way I can describe it to him is that I felt as if my life had literally flashed before my eyes. I feel like I experienced some kind of death or rebirth.

175,Dream about my friend who died,2,dgwx3l,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/dgwx3l/dream_about_my_friend_who_died/,2,"This is my first post to this subreddit. Three weeks ago one of my good friends passed away from suicide and I dreamt of him three nights ago.

In the dream I was standing in line at the foyer of my old high school's auditorium waiting for my little brother's school orchestra concert to begin.

All of the people in line were wearing generally dark clothing with colors such as black, navy, dark grey, and tan to name a few. I glanced off to the side of the room and there I see my departed friend standing against the wall in a bright shirt that I can't rember whether it was tie-dye or a solid orange color.

Naturally I walk up to him and ask what he's doing here and that you're supposed to be dead. He doesn't see me. So, I wave my hand in front of his face and ask why he isn't speaking. No response. It was like I was the ghost not him. 

I start crying and walk back to my place in line. Looking back over he's still there, just standing, looking around, but still can't see me. 

I don't remember anything else after that. It was a strange dream and I've never had a dream that I remember experiencing sadness so, even stranger.",1570924456.0

177,I spend half of my life in a world I can never share with anyone.,24,dgozkj,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/dgozkj/i_spend_half_of_my_life_in_a_world_i_can_never/,12,"This is my first post. My dreams have started to have an effect of me long after I wake up that is becoming impossible to ignore, and I'm hoping someone here may've some advice or experiences to share. 

For as long as I can remember, all of my dreams have taken place in one extremely vast, vivid dreamscape. The dreams themselves don't repeat (although there are some common themes, usually involving some unknown person or group trying to kill me) but the locations where they take place are always the same. My dream world includes multiple cities, a huge theme park, an airport, shopping malls, a museum, stores, restaurants, beaches, highways, forests, neighborhoods full of houses and apartment buildings. I know them all as well as I know myself. I can tell you how to find any store in the mall. I notice when a ride at the theme park is remodeled. I know which roads to take to get where I'm going and what I'll pass along the way. Not ""know"" because they're places I invented in my brain. Know because I've been there, every night. 

I can't quite describe the longing I feel to see some kind of proof of this place. It's like the most intense nostalgia without even a photograph to look at. Even in my dreams I'll say ""look! it's the dream place I'm always trying to describe! I should take a picture of it so I can show everyone in the morning!"" I've tried dream journaling, and drawing, but it isn't giving me what I need. I've been through so much in this world. I've laughed there, cried there, experienced my wildest fantasies and most intense fears. I've spent half of my life in this place. In many ways it is like my true home. 

I don't necessarily know what kind of advice I'm hoping to get. It would be great to hear from anyone who dreams in a similar way, especially if you've also had problems removing yourself from your dream world during waking life and have found something that helps you. 

TLDR I go to the same dream world every night, what's going on and how do I come back to reality in the morning?",1570875301.0

I was at a place that looked like my school, but it had been modified for cows to be raised there. My classmate— who I shall call Bree— was there and was talking to the man who was taking care of us. She told him to protect me, and then suggested that he “branded the child.” So, he took me outside to be branded, but there were people outside. (They didn’t know it was me btw) On one side, a group of people were drawing graffiti on the wall, and the other side the people were just standing there. I was afraid of these people, and they rushed forward to attack me, but the man protected me and pushed them back— mind you there are probably 20 people there at least.  Then I woke up.
Anyone have any idea what this means?

180,Just had the weirdest half-lucid dream,1,dgyqoc,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/dgyqoc/just_had_the_weirdest_halflucid_dream/,0,"Okay, so I say half-lucid because in the dream I knew I was dreaming, but I was still in the dream mind-state of just going with the flow of whatever happens. In this dream, I met someone else who was dreaming. They were trying to control the universe but were failing miserably, and so I was egging them about how good I was at lucid dreaming, creating lightning bolts and summoning aliens. I was being a real dick about it for some reason. If that person is real, and they're reading this, just know I'm sorry and I wouldn't act like that in real life. I know they're probably just a figment of my subconscious, but I've never had a dream like this before. I soon lost my lucidity, and it turned into a strange nightmare.

For some context, I have an eating disorder, and in this nightmare I was lost in a stairwell. I kept weighing myself over and over again, and the scale kept saying I was 10 pounds heavier than I am in real life. It was freaking me out, and soon I left the stairwell and came into an indoor pool area. There was someone else there with me, but I don't know who, it might've been the same person as earlier but I'm not sure. I wanted to go swimming, and I was even wearing underwear underneath my clothes that was passable as a bikini. The other person kept telling me not to swim, though, and it was kind of pissing me off. Right after this conversation, my boyfriend entered the pool area. He was looking around, and I could tell he was looking for me. Now we're at his house, and he tells me he had just been hanging out with my ex-boyfriend and his friend. Now, in real life, this group of people is kind of dumb and untrustworthy, so I can't see him going out of his way to chill with them. Although, in the dream, he said to me something like, ""those people are actually pretty cool, I'm glad I got to know them"" or whatever. Even in the dream I was shocked, but I didn't say anything rude about it. Eventually we try to watch the new El Camino movie that came out, but I asked him if we could watch it at my place instead. He agreed and I woke up.

The second paragraph here is just a log for me more than anything, but that first paragraph about me being somewhat lucid I really wanted to share here. That's never happened to me before, where I know I'm dreaming but I'm still in the dream consciousness. I hope that happens again.",1570932894.0

185,"The most surreal, scary, and most interesting dream I've had in a while.",1,dgyaj4,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/dgyaj4/the_most_surreal_scary_and_most_interesting_dream/,2,"The dream started with 7 year old me and 4 other friends at a fancy event, possibly a theater. We left the party and walked to a street that felt incredibly familiar and nostalgic, despite me never having been there in real life. it must have been winter in the dream because there was a huge mound of snow. I said something to make my friends laugh and climbed up the mound of snow. It was really powdery and I laughed as I tumbled down. Then we crossed the street and entered a hospital with seven floors, each one themed around one of the seven deadly sins. For some reason the hospital was built so half the floors were underground. Each floor had a gas in the air that was colored based on the floor's sin. The nurses all wore attire corresponding to the sin of the floor they were on. On the main floor the nurses dressed normally. One of the main hall nurses politely greeted us and walked us down further into the hospital. She had a very strange, overly formal demeanor and I was creeped out by her. I saw a fat nurse wheeling a corpse to the morgue on the gluttony floor. I think the last floor we got to was envy before that part of the dream abruptly ended. The next part of the dream took place in an old and mildly dillapitated farmhouse. I was older now, maybe 12 or 13. I was upstairs playing with a VR headset. However, instead of being virtual reality, it was augmented reality and it put enemies in the real world. I played H3VR and spent a lot of time customizing my 3 weapons of choice, a machine gun, a shotgun, and an SMG. There was someone sitting next to me and he handed me a red grip to put on the shotgun. I couldn't tell where the grip was supposed to go on the gun. He told me it was a ""pistol grip"" and that I was supposed to put it on the side of the stock, like a bandolier but instead of holding shotgun shells or bullets, it holds an entire pistol instead. He called me a dumbass for not knowing this. I was finally ready to play. I did a front flip out the window and held my machine gun in one hand and my SMG in the other. I walked down a steep hill, with two taller hills beside it. I sprayed down any enemies that spawned on the two hills. Then, a ton of enemies rose from the ground, presumably they were camouflaged. They were arranged in a checker formation. A timer appeared, and I had to shoot 30 of them before time ran out and they would be able to shoot me back. I succeeded, and the rest that didn't die exploded. I continued on down the road and came across a tunnel leading into a laboratory. Before I could walk through the corridor, a massive slime beast emerged. Terrified, I tried to fire a few shots into it with my shotgun to no avail. The beast overpowered me and tried to eat me. I was so scared I took off the VR headset and took a break. When I came back to the tunnel, I somehow got past the beast. I don't remember how I was able to. Next, I entered a room to the right. It was another hospital, although it was more like an infirmary. Instead of being filled with humans, however, it was filled with cats. Cute, small, humanoid cats. I sat in the waiting room and observed a nurse cat injecting a bedridden kitten with a syringe filled with a glowing orange liquid. The kitten started convulsing. Suddenly, an orange, thing-like mass emerged from the kitten. It grew rapidly and the nurse screamed. There was a door behind the mass and I ran up to the receptionist's desk and jumped off of it, flipping over the orange mass. I ran through the door and slammed it shut. A single cat was inside the room with me. The room looked like it was still under construction. I could hear screaming and banging coming from the waiting room. I sat cowering in the corner, hoping the thing doesn't get in. After a few seconds, the door burst open and the thing rushed in. It grabbed me and I spent the last part of my dream staring at the thing towering over me. Just before it lunged at me, the dream ended.",1570930834.0
186,The most intense dream I ever had,1,dgxodg,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/dgxodg/the_most_intense_dream_i_ever_had/,0,"LONG POST PROBABLY:

This is a dream I had several times over the course of two years while in uni, about 5 years ago. I only ever had this dream when it came to the exam season and the stress levels were higher. I was often getting up at 7am and studying straight through till 11pm or later. I also had pretty broken sleep too so I wasn't in a great way during this time. Happily, since graduating I've not had this dream at all. This is by far the most intense and vivid dream I've ever had.

&#x200B;

**The Dream:**

I'm running down an alleyway in the dark. It's pitch black, but I can make out a light at the end of the alley. It's raining - hard. I can feel the weight of the water pulling my clothes down. My shirt is sticking to my chest making it hard to breathe and my lungs are already on fire as I try to keep running. My trousers are burning and pulling on the hairs of my legs as they are weighed down by the rain, but I keep going.

&#x200B;

I can feel that there is something behind me, something bad, that I have to get away from. I feel like it's hunting me, so the urge to keep running despite the pain keeps me going. As I get nearer to the light, I can feel the hairs on my arms standing on end, catching the wind. It starts to sting now with every rain drop that hits my bare skin. I catch a glimpse of what's at the end of the alley, it's a road. I can see the rain and winder are heavier and stronger than there are where I am now, but I have to reach it. It's now that I can hear the thing that's chasing me, it's wolves. I hear the snarling and snapping of jaws grow louder as they get closer to me. I'm too scared to look back in case I fall, but I can almost feel them biting the heels of my shoes.

&#x200B;

I reach the end of the alley and fall onto the road, the rain is even heavier and I'm getting more and more drenched. I fall and feel the asphalt scrape my hands. I turn around thinking I'll see the wolves lunge for me. But they're gone, the alley and buildings are gone. It's just me, the rain, and the road.

&#x200B;

I see lights in the distance, coming towards me. As they get closer I can make out what they are - six lanes each full with big rigs driving full tilt towards me. They're staggered, so I try to dodge them as they drive past me. But the gust of wind as they pass, and the vacuum left behind when they're past pushes and pulls me around, making it harder and harder to move. I feel sluggish, like my legs are too tired from running, but I tell myself if I can reach the edge of the road I'll be OK. So I dodge and run as fast as I can to reach the edge of the outside lane, the trucks getting closer and closer together with each step I take.

&#x200B;

Just as I take the last step to get off the road, the last truck passes by and the wind it drags with it pushes me off the road, but the truck didn't hit me. I can't see where I'm falling, but I eventually land on my back on soaking, muddy ground. When my senses come to, I try to move, but my body is stuck. I can move my head but my body refuses my commands. The road and the trucks are gone, it's now almost completely dark. Just some low ambient light illuminating my body and the puddles in the mud around me.

&#x200B;

It gets quiet, the wind and rain have stopped. And I hear footsteps. I turn my head as far as I can to see who it is. There's a hooded figure walking towards me. They're barefoot, but it still looks like their feet aren't even getting wet, like their steps are gliding over the mud rather than going through it. The person stops about two feet from me, looking down on me. I can't see their face, but I can make out glowing perfect blue eyes, staring right into mine. I get scared.

&#x200B;

As soon as the thought of me being scared enters my mind, the person throws off their cloak and I see them, topless, and barefoot, wearing only a pair of trousers now. But it's me - a different version of me. Taller, stronger, fitter, better looking, and I can tell somehow - smarter. This alternate me is looking down at me and they're not angry, they just looks sad. His eyes are still glowing, but dimmer now. And I see a single tear fall from his eye, it lands a few inches from my fingers. I try to reach up to him, but I still can't move.

&#x200B;

He turns to leave and I try to call out, but my voice won't work. They walk away and leave me, disappearing into the pitch black. I lie there for a few more moments and then I wake up.

**End of Dream.**

&#x200B;

I've spoken to a few people about this dream, trying to figure out if it means anything in particular or if it was just a manifestation of stress. If you'd care to, I'd like to hear your thoughts.

I’m laying in bed when my body begins to tingle all over. I’m struggling to move, to escape this tingling feeling, but soon it overtakes me in the midst of my struggle, and it’s almost as if I’m sucked out of my body, and then I wake up in my real me, with it feeling as though my “soul” got transported from that dream me to the current me. I’ve had it several times, but usually not very often, however as of today I’ve had this dream two days in a row, but this time I was in my car when the tingling feeling of death came and I accepted it as opposed to struggling. The oddest part about this is I always go to the bathroom after waking up, so I go and look in the mirror, see my eyes incredibly red, look away and then look back and my eyes are perfectly clear. I don’t understand what’s happening or what this means or why I’m seemingly hallucinating my eyes being red. If anyone can provide any insight I’d be incredibly appreciative!",1570926229.0

I woke up because I realized I never heard that song before but also that it didn’t exist at all it felt special because this artist had passed away as well so hearing this song was a little taste of what could’ve been anyways Ive been up for a few hours trying to recreate the beat and I wrote down some of the lyrics I remember hearing but my god do I just wanna hear the song again it’s actually very sad but amazing what the human brain can create in dreams,1570912481.0

and then suddenly, the guy who put poison in it yelled: ""It is poisoned!"" (he felt kinda guilty and looked upset)

then before I could drink any of it (but it was already in my mouth) I spit/spat it out immediately.

Then my dad came with me to the kitchen/dining room to quickly drink water.

But it would get worse everytime you looked outside cause random yard things will move towards your house. So like random chairs, a bush, etc. So one time I was walking home and I saw it in the sky. So I noticed what I did. Forced me and my little sister inside. Boarded up all the windows and hid in our room..but even in my dream she was an asshole.

It's always violent and crazy and scary. Sometimes it's my mom or boyfriend trying to murder me, sometimes it's violent dreams where I'm haunted by ghosts or being chased by them, sometimes it's just weird dreams that are scary. Most of them don't make sense when I wake up but they're very very horrible. Once I got a dream about Sharon Tate and she was violated and murdered and I saw her mangled corpse in my dream. That's by far the worst one ever. Then last night I got a dream that I drowned my mother and I'm crying and hyperventilating but then I realize that I haven't actually killed her but I'm still crying in my dream, so much so that when I woke up I was out of breath and my throat was paining. I could feel the feeling in my dream and it felt a little too real. Then mostly I get a dream that my mom, my brother, my boyfriend and some random people are chasing me to murder me and I'm hurt and trying to get away but they're like RIGHT behind me. They never catch me but they're always on my tail. There's a lot of variations to the last dream but the basic premise is to kill me.

I'm new to Reddit & when I realized there was this sub I decided to give it a shot. I tried researching the meanings but I really couldn't find anything. 

The dream was relatively short & simple. It was night time, & I was standing outside with someone. The person prompted me to look up at the sky. There were two moons, almost eclipsing each other. In my dream, having two moons wasn't an oddity. It was normal. But the way they looked wasn't normal. 

The moon in the front (closer to earth) was completely black. Not a new moon - you could still see all of it. It was just black in colour. I knew in my dream that this wasn't normal & I started to feel dread. Like the moon was sick. 

The second moon, the one further from Earth, looked normal. Except that it was crumbling. Part of it was already missing & more of it was breaking off. It wasn't hitting the earth, so we were technically safe, but it was still horrifying & I knew it meant something bad. And then the dream was over. 

--- TL;DR: There were two moons in my dream about to eclipse eachother. One was completely black (not a new moon) & the other was beginning to crumble apart.

Does anyone have a clue what this might mean? Thank you in advance! ♡",1570916843.0

Not teen Tumblr stuff.,1,dgv81p,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/dgv81p/devil_wanted_to_eat_me_not_teen_tumblr_stuff/,1,"So the story starts 6 years ago in my moms apartment. As a kid growing up i was made to believe that god exists even tho deep inside me i always knew god doesnt exist. My father was a terrible person and my mom always feared i'm going to become like him. My mother on the other hand was religious christian orthodox. As a kid i was a nice kid as i remember but inside me there was this evilness that i could always feel. I liked bad stuff, For example when i was 5 i decided that when i'll grow up i'm going to smoke because smoking seemed really cool to me. When i turned 14 i started smoking. So definitely bad genes and also i had no father around. My mom when through a lot and also had to go through shit like me. Theres no denying i'm a bad person but most likely i believe that the bad in me goes out because no one really understands me not even me. I said all that to justify the thing im going to say now. So because my mom brainwashed me into believing stuff that dont exist like horoscopes and religion it had unlocked in me the capability to be delirious and it being considered ok. I started to test if god exists by reading the bible of Satan and the bible of god. When i read those 2 funny books i still had some believe in me that it might be true, even tho my logic was against that idea. I came across the idea that i can provoke god into punishing me, I thought if he exists he will punish me. sound delirious enough? good read more. so i started to paint the symbol of the goat in schools with graphity paint and all around the neighborhood like the Antichrist because i'm fucking autistic. I also told my friends about Satan the fallen angel and his story..ye. So anyway i saw an add that said this: SATAN CHOOSES YOU! SELL YOUR SOUL NOW FOR A GREAT PRICE ;) L.. Which surprised me enough to click on it. Because not only the add knew that i was drawing those things and was interested in Satan. I thought wow that's Google's cookies right there best of their Kind. It wasn't because i saw the 'L' next to the title. My name starts with L. Theactualking is my username on Reddit because my name is Leon as A Lion. I thought ok...this is interesting. So i press it and it redirects me into a site where you can make an actual contract selling your soul. Get Whatever you wish for an internity in hell. That was the first line of the contract. I though that doesn't sound like something Satan would say lol who would actually sign it if it was real. so i do the contract hoping something will happen like Satan appearing in front of me or something. I sign the contract and press submit and the screen shows CONGRATULATIONS! You are now Doomed forever! I felt nothing just a bit of fear that it might be true but at the same time the reality was that someone made this site out of mere troll so me getting scared is exactly what the person wants to accomplish. So anyway it convinced me that god doesn't exist. I though well if Satan doesn't exist then god does neither. So i went on my day like nothing happened. When i went to sleep i saw really strange dream that i question to this day. So i start being a noble knight on a horse speeding through woods to get to a combat area. As i 
 was riding through the woods i saw beside me an enemy knight. So i though i'll fight him now beat him and proceed the way to the battle. So i get off my horse the enemy knight does aswell, and we start to fight. I don't remember the fight but then there is a flash back that i'm laying on the ground the enemy knight is standing above me and slices through a sword into my chest. There was a flash of light and then a tunnel that got me into a place. The place reminded me of  Minecraft nether (for some mysterious reason) So i'm in this cubic place of red rock and i'm standing on a platform that stops and has and edge with most likely a straight down cliff in front of me. but the platform blocks the view of what there might be down of the cliff and i don't seem really interested in seeing what it is i just am confused of where i am. No fear no feelings or panic just a bit confused. So then as i'm looking i see skulls in the corners of the wall behind me. So i assume i'm probably in hell. There you see a Person appears. Like a Granny she has hippie clothes on. You know the ones that are oversized for you hangs on your body and the material is really thin. She has many necklaces like felt ball ones on her wrist as well. The granny was Really tall like 2,5  meters or 8,2 feet (i googled that) gray dead hear so long it reached and was dragged on the floor. The Granny was so skinny you could see her skin hanging and you could see the structure of the skull just by looking at her and her eyes so round and appearing. She Looked at me and asked do you know where you are? I didn't say anything. She said do you want to know? I said nothing. Do you want to know what's down that edge over there? I looked and i just got a bit curious, and she immediately said come ill show you. I saw black type strange liquid and red dots all over appearing and disappearing. I thought 'whats that strange thing' She answered look closely and see. And i look closely i zoom in with my eyes and get stunned.. she says The red dots is magma and the blackness you saw before? That were dozens of burned down souls so many they cover the whole area and the light barely presses through. Do you want to hear them. I didn't but now i was really curious. The granny grabbed me by the shoulder and snapped her fingers. Suddenly i hear such screams so loud so painful that it was like they were screaming right to my ear so i panic and jump back to the wall and beg for it to stop. The Granny snapped her fingers grabbed by the hand picked me up and put her hand on my shoulder and waved with the other hand creating a see through cloud. She said the person who killed you afterwards fell down a waterfall. She said that as showing me it on the cloud. He is over there now. She points at the cliff, there was a mistake done you shouldn't be here so don't worry. So i ask her what am i going to do then. She says you see that elevator over there? and she points at a circular thing punched into a wall. She says from there the holy coin with the holy blood of Christ will fall soon. It is your key out of here. Soon it will fall. It does and she picks it up and gives me it. I look at it there was this in wards circular line with symbols on the lines and on the side there was the holy blood. The coins material was stone and it was a laptop wide and half of a basket balls thick. She then takes the coin and tosses it from the cliff. I have no reaction thinking this is part of procedure probably. From there a light appears like an alien spaceship and drags upwards the knight who killed me. So then it hit me that i got fraud. I looked at the Granny quickly thinking oh my god she's...she's and as im looking at her she was already smiling and as shes smiling shes becoming she turns slowly into a beast the place starts to have an earthquake hellquake. I start to run as fast as i can and i hear behind me. BOOM....BOOM....BOOM..BOOM...BOOM..BOOM.. BOOM. BOOM. BOOMBOOMBOOMBOOM. Heavy footsteps first walking then running. as i'm running in the hellquake i start hearing the people in the magma again screaming GOD IS MAD GOD IS MAD GOD IS MAD. Then i hear a light and i feel it as well it was god appearing. I hear the scream of the sinful again they are screaming HELP ME HELP ME. and as i'm running and i feel Satan is so close to me to grab me a crack open on the wall and i see grass through it and jump through the small crack and i become a snake. i crawl up to an apple tree and i wake up. So yeah. Tell me your thoughts on it.",1570916091.0

I was in some hospital walking through the floors/halls? Of the hospital and decided to go to the third stage. It seemed like a little flat so I thought that this is my flat now.
My cousin came over right after and it was dark outside , so we decided to go sleep.
But before that I told him that , if you go to sleep and float out of your body , then you can fly around everywhere!
So we talked a bit more and then we go to sleep.
I tried to go out of my body but it didn't worked. I was kinda a little out of my body , but because the Rest of my ""ghost body"" still touched my sleeping body so I couldn't escape.
I walked up in the dream and asked my cousin if he could get it right but he didn't answered. Seemed completely normal to me.
And then another dream came.

What does this mean? 
What would have maybe happened if I actually escaped my sleeping dream body?
I would be very thankful if you answer that!

Last night when I was incredibly tired and likely to fall asleep in seconds, I kept repeating in my head: ""Everything I am about to experience is going to be a dream."" I don't know how but suddenly found myself in my math classroom, I was having a bad time solving problems when all of the sudden I realized: ""Hey wait a second- It's the weekend why am I in math class?"" So I did some lucid dream checkups, I checked the clock and yep, it was spazzing out, I drew a symbol on my hand and it stayed there, I realized I was in a dream and did some stuff out of my free will, like... grabbing a machete and... hacking everyone in the room...? Don't get me wrong, looking back on it I'm really surprised. I thought I had free will and made some decisions myself, but also... not? When I woke up the first weird thing I realized was that I had no sensation in the dream, I had no sense of touch, I could see, but not hear touch smell or taste. I am really confused...

Was this a dream about lucid dreaming where I happened to realize I was in a dream, or was that part of the dream? This is some inception shit i'm really confused...

Can anyone explain this to me? Is this some sort of first step to lucid dreaming or something? Because looking back on it I feel like I had no control in the dream whatsoever",1570912127.0

Is that normal?), although it’s not like any classroom from my school, because the ground was temporarily made from red carpet at the beginning, but it actually switched back to the hard ground mid-dream and dream me didn’t notice. I’m actually on Fall Break right now so the fact I got a school related dream on my first day off is weird imo.

(Spin Section)
The class is taking some kind of test and in the middle of it my body starts getting sudden urges to start wiggling. Like I genuinely couldn’t sit still, I got really bad, embarrassing urges to move my body, so I started un-controllably wiggling my butt in my seat. My other classmates notice and comment on it, probably didn’t say anything too important. This makes me notice that my classmates aren’t from the same class, they’re a combination of all my classmates I had from Kindergarten to present day (all the ones I remember from Elementary all looked older to match the age group of the classroom). There either wasn’t a teacher in the classroom, or the teacher didn’t give two s***’s about what was happening.

So eventually, my wiggling urge gets so out of hand that I just straight get up out of my seat and start spinning in place (classmates make derogatory comments on this as well), much like a dance move. I was spinning for a long time at a time too, maybe roughly 11 rotations in one spin. I always fell down after every spin (of course it was around this time that the ground reverted to the hard ground). Sometimes while spinning I get so much speed that I would lift off of the ground like a helicopter and spin in mid-air, hover for a good moment, and then kind of launch myself against a wall. Sometimes I launch into a classmate’s desk and it got really embarrassing. This would basically repeat itself for quite some time. I start spinning to relieve myself of my weird, unbeatable urge to spin, I helicopter myself into the air, and I either fall onto the ground or launch into a wall. 

(Dog Section)
Now the dream kind of **[abruptly throws me into]** another plot point. I leave school and am being driven home by my Grandma for some reason. By the way, I didn’t have any recollection of actually leaving the school and getting into my Grandma’s car. One moment I was spinning in school and the next I kind of pull a King Crimson and am suddenly being driven home by my Grandma. 

While near my house, I’m panicking because of what happened at school, and I try telling my Grandma I have something important to tell her. While she is confused at my rambling, we crash into another car, but the crash suspiciously resembles a car crash I had in her car previously this year (no injuries at all, Grandma’s car just looked weird for the rest of the year). While we get out of the car to inspect the damage, I notice I had a fairly large bite mark and what looked to be a claw mark on the top of my right leg, probably from a small dog or some other creature, definitely not an insect (this is important later). I hypothesized for the time being that the bite infected me with a disease that made me obsessed with moving/spinning. Then it starts raining. It was a clear sky with barely any clouds, but it was raining. Hard. So me and my ‘ma just completely abandon the car and try to get home, which was really close. 

We try to take a shortcut through this area had never seen before. It was a couple of black abandoned houses just together in rows. They almost looked copy-pasted. The grass looked pretty enough. It looked creepy but not a comical “this place is definitely evil” creepy. Oh yeah, the woman we crashed into and this other guy who I *think* ran out of gas for his car joined us. 

Everyone else is farther ahead than I am (this is also important later), and suddenly this Weiner dog starts mean-mugging me and aggressively pulls on my pants. Suddenly, a s*** ton of Weiner dogs and Pomeranians specifically that were apparently working together just start surrounding everyone and growling. There must have been at least 50 of them total. Every time someone moves, the dogs surround that one person. They’re fast as hell, so trying to simply outrun them wasn’t an option. There was so many I accidentally stepped on some trying to re-adjust my position, but they didn’t seem too angry about that. My body started vibrating intensely, but that was probably more from outright fear more than the disease, although I wouldn’t be surprised if the disease played a part in it.

I didn’t see, but I assume what happened is that one of the randoms cracked under pressure and made a run for it, because all of the dogs started chasing after a specific target. Because I was so far behind and the dogs went in front of me, I escaped through the opposite direction (entrance) of the pathway and ran home as fast as I could... Is what I attempted. I made it home but I didn’t run the full way, my dream made another jump-cut and suddenly I was in my room at my house.

Once in my room I was relieved I made it out alive. The spins came back, but I was alone in my own house and fairly used to the spins by this point, so it wasn’t as anxiety-inducing, but I started getting drastically more dizzy from them than before. Once I finally got over my spinning urge for the time being, I remembered that my Grandma was still at the shortcut with the dogs, so I texted 911 (yes, texted. Idk either). After I contacted them they said they were on the way. By this point I was way too dizzy to even try to leave the house and go back for Grandma. At the end of my dream I hear a distant yet close, loud yet quiet, rumbling. I assumed that I was too late, and that rumbling was the sound of the army of dogs finishing off the rest of the people at the shortcut, including my Grandma. And then the dream ends and I wake up.

**(TL;DR)**
I am affected with a disease that gives me an uncontrollable urge to move and spin my body around at school while I was taking a test. I’m driven home by my Grandma and we crash, so we take a shortcut to the house with two other people. A bunch of Weiner dogs and Pomeranians jump us. I was the only one to escape. I start spinning again at my house, but now I start getting actually dizzy from it, unlike before. I contact 911 so they can rescue the rest of the people at the shortcut. Shortly after, I hear a loud rumbling, which is implied to be the dogs killing off everyone else at the shortcut, then I wake up.

One other creepy thing about this dream was that I genuinely felt dizzy like in my dream after waking up, as if I had actually been spinning. I could barely walk straight after getting up. I recovered fairly quickly though. That really freaked me out at the time. I never had my physical style kind of transfer from my dream into real life. Also I’m not sure if it was the dogs who gave me the disease or not. I’m kind of 50/50 about it. I doubt my dream would have that much foreshadowing, but it’s possible.


I remember hearing that all dreams have some hidden meaning relating to your life. I have no idea what this dream is trying to say. What, “You’re a coward who will abandon a family member and leave them to be killed”? Was that the message? Honestly, I wanted to share probably one of the most elaborate dreams I’ve ever had (me dreaming is incredibly rare in itself) and give this subreddit my story. I’m confused and unsettled and I wanted to see if my dream has any common themes or elements that the people on this sub can point out.",1570888730.0

209,A dream I had last night,3,dgpkeb,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/dgpkeb/a_dream_i_had_last_night/,1,"Dream from October 10th 2019. This is my most recent dream but I can't say it was from October 10th, it was the last dream I had leading to me waking up at 6:15 am. The dream was mainly about how I was in my house watching tv on a dark night. I hear a knock at my door and I answered it. The person standing there looked like a type of person who has ""magic"" powers, like a fairy but the same size as me, one you would see in the movies. He looked like a normal guy but he told me he could take me to a specific time in the past for as long as I want. The details get blurry after this but I found out I had been taken to October of 2003. Why 2003? I don't know. But as I walked out the door of my old house, I found out that all my personal posessions were still on me. I was in the year 2003 with a phone made in 2017, an id from 2016, etc. I got super excited and I saw people walking by, every single one of them had much older technology and outfits. One was using a flip phone that had many buttons, I walked up to a person and showed him my touchscreen phone, which would not be released to the public for another 4 years. The person looked completely stunned, he was questioning how did this exist, how much I paid for this, where he can get one, and just expressed obvious disbelief. After that, I realized the potential of being the only person who knew exactly what was going to happen for the next 16 years leading up to 2019, I told groups of people that a touchscreen phone would be released in June 2007 and it would completely revolutionize the phone industry. Meanwhile, I was thinking of ways to take adavntage of my knowledge of what was going to happen in the future but my mind was struggling to come up with things, either things I had recalled in my dream or I had forgotten after I woke up. Either way it was the strangest experience and probably one of the best dreams I've had recently. Eventually my phone died about 16 hours later and I could not charge it because the cord for the touchscreen phone I was using was not mass produced in factories yet. I explored for another 8 hours around the much older hometown and every car I saw was made no later than 2003. I could not find the 2 year old version of me because my 18 year old self had taken his place. Strange. Eventually the same man I had met at the beginning of the dream returned and said ""time's up"" and teleported me back to 2019, exactly where I was standing in the doorway looking out and the man was no longer there and then I woke up. Thanks for reading this post, it had taken me a bit to compile the information and type it out start to end. Thanks for reading about another random set of memories that can be arranged into something you can dive into and learn.",1570878461.0

Last night I had one of those dreams that is so intense it wakes you up. I don’t recall all the details but I will piece together the parts I do remember.

There was me, my older brother and my mother living in the house I grew up in. I catch my mom up on big things in my life (graduating, my job, etc).

At one point, I introduce my ex-boyfriend to her but not as my ex just as my boyfriend (For context; My Ex and I have been on-and-off since 2017 and I went through being cheated on and lots of abuse, not too long ago I blocked him on absolutely everything and told myself I am never going back). After introducing  them my mother pulls me aside and warns me he is no good for me.

From this point on I don’t remember as much, but it was kind of like the movie groundhog day where in my dream i kept reliving the same exact day. No matter what i did, my mother would end up dying somehow. then i would wake up and try to save her and she would die a different way. and then a different way. 

Until I woke up at 3am trying to make sense of all this.

While I don't remember much about the trailer, its ending made quite the impression on me, as it had Hank and Bobby in a ROCKETSHIP and Hank said ""Where we're going, we won't need propane"" before goong hyperspeed.

I’m currently residing in an African country for my studies (reality) and found out I was pregnant. Because abortion is illegal I had no choice here so I ended up telling my family and they were oddly VERY supportive and offered to take care of my child whilst I continue my studies however the reality set in and I was 100% confident about wanting an abortion. 

I go back home to England and meet my best friend let’s call her T (I’m 3 months pregnant by this time). She works in a shelter for pregnant women (this is just in the dream irl she’s a student like me) and she doesn’t offer me any sort of help or support which is very unlike her. I even beg and plead w her even says if she finds an abortion clinic she would prioritise “Kristina” who is another patient in the shelter to get an abortion before me and she’s yet to find it so she cannot help me.
The last part of my dream I just accepted this and felt alone and decided that I would get a hanger or kill myself to rid myself of this baby and woke up.
I still feel the hopelessness and desperation from the dream and had to google abortion laws in different countries just in case this ever came true to set my mind at ease😂
Another note is that I’m a virgin and still a virgin in this dream! As a fact I’m baffled as to how I even became pregnant in the first place.

I don't remember how the dream started but I was in my room and I was kinda rescuing colourful slugs, like 5-6 maybe, they were in my room and I was trying to put them in their natural habitat ( There's a lot of wild vegetation behind my room, I live in A hostel room in my college). 

And as I was doing that I saw a baby snake about 14-15 inches long under my table, I looked at it and it seemed really fascinating to me, it looked very different from other snakes ( I find all snakes fascinating but this one was very different) after like a minute of inspection I went back to the slugs. After I was done with the slugs I went back to the snake and I got bit worried as to how it got there and how am I going to send it back to his home/habitat whatever and then again I started inspecting the little detail on it's body and like really looking at it in confusion and awe.

There are 3 things about this dream:

1. I randomly wake up sometimes
2. The topic of the dream/ the People that show up in it are completly random
3. I always wake up to go to the bathroom and get a glass of water


The dream starts off in complete darkness, im on a spaceship, stage or anywhere really, then it cuts to Black again, shows something aproaching, and then shows me, motionless, on the floor.

I then start to hear yelling, screaming, and see text saying weird shit like ""YOU KNOW THAT THATS NOT THE WAY TO DIE"", I then wake up, screaming, crying, my heart is pumping like i've ran 2000 miles and made it alive, but somehow...
Somehow, im still in the dream.
Somehow, i still hear the screaming.

I plop back to bed, it starts all over.

I eventually wake up and go get a glass of water, without the screaming ofc.

It’s difficult to explain but, in my dreams I can hear or see things about people that I’m not  even close with, and when I think about the stuff I see or hear, there’s a huge chance that they are actually true. 

For example:
I know a person whose name is X but I’m not that close with them. I also know Y and Z who are close to X. I hear a conversation between Y and Z. They are talking about X and saying things that (when I think about them) have a huge possibility of being true in real life. Btw they are not talking about X’s personality and stuff. They are talking about something X had done which I haven’t heard or thought about it in real life
but after waking up thinking about it, sounds so
possible that that thing happened.

Another example:
I see a person A in my dream doing something and it’s such a thing that I’m so sure they did that thing and it actually happened in real life because it’s such a thing person A would do.

The narrative kept switching between them.",2,dgpes0,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/dgpes0/i_had_two_bodies_one_of_them_was_myself_and_one/,2,"Okay, so the narration was focused on a random cat with sunglasses on her head, sitting on a pile of Steven Universe's shirts, and other cats nearby. This cat (AKA me) was thinking about how tired she was of trying and failing to organize the group. Not that she couldn't control them, but that she herself couldn't get anything done, thus failing the rest of the team. She decided to surrender her leadership to another cat, before entering a building to cool off.

When she walked past myself and Dad, the narrative switched to me. I was thinking and talking to him about that same issue. Then I said that for all my life, I'd been leader of these cats. But now everything was changing... He said something, and I started thinking about my existence as a cat. (This is when the narrative revealed that me and the cat were the same person.) Being a cat just felt... Right.

When I looked at my cat body, who now had solid brown fur, a brown gem on her chest and a brown gem on her underbelly, the POV of the story flipped to the cat. I decided to do at least something good for the autumnal season, so I started looking for snacks. Also, did I mention that the building I was in looked like a grocery store? So, my human body disappeared into an aisle while my cat body walked around. There was an aisle apparently dedicated to chocolate syrup, and I wasn't satisfied with that because cats can't eat chocolate.

When I left the aisle to walk to the next one, I was startled by the sight of glowing eyes at the back door, before realizing it was a cat. Then I was startled by two more. I somehow opened the door to let the three cats (two of which were my actual cats) in.

Then I woke up.

It’s been close to a year and half since this happened and I had the strangest dream last night and it felt so real. It started out downtown in my home town. I was hanging out with my friend and another good friend from our elementary days. Everyone seems to know he passed, but are strangely okay with the fact that he is back. 

We all are catching up and we end up back at my friends house and we are reliving a sleep over we had in 3rd grade. This part felt so real. It was me, my friend who passed, and our other friend. Everything was going fine and we were asking questions about the incident. I then decided to ask what the other side was like. The moment I finished the question my friend who is no longer with us rolled over and attacked me. He was like a demon. He bit into my arm like a zombie. Blood went everywhere and I woke up.

So having these types of dreams which seem startlingly real aren’t new for me. But last night I in my dream, I had a first- I had choked someone to death, and then threw their body out of a sort of ferry into the water. But the ferry was only like a 30 meter ride connecting my hotel to another place. So the body was obviously going to be found soon. 
In the dream I had apparently been very drunk when I did this- but I felt immediately that everything in my life as I knew it had changed. I had killed someone. And I was going to go to prison for the rest of my life. 
But somehow they never figure out it was me... But I’m stuck in a cycle of still being in this hotel where it happened, like limbo. 
In my dream I was so devastated- it was like I had actually killed someone and the self hate and the fear of getting caught were so real. One of the worst and most terrifying dreams I’ve ever had.

233,I had the same dream,3,dgk3xb,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/dgk3xb/i_had_the_same_dream/,6,"When I was 12 my mom’s then-boyfriend reluctantly told us a horrible nightmare he had a few weeks before. I thought it was disturbing but I wasn’t overly frightened. That night I went to bed and had the EXACT SAME dream. I’ll do my best to explain it...

My mother and I are inside a chain linked fence with a playground outside of a one room school house you’d see an abandoned mining town. Children are playing on the playground, running around quite happily. Outside of the fence is golden grassland as far as the eye can see with a cloudless blue sky. Suddenly, the sky goes red and the teacher of said schoolhouse starts screaming for everyone to “get inside! Get inside now!” And we run inside and bolt and barricade the wooden double-doors. My mom and I look out the window to the right of the doors overlooking the yard and chain link fence. Outside the fence we see a boy and a girl with matted, short black hair. They were pale as paper with overly large eyes that were just sockets, wearing all black torn clothing. Their walking was not right. They took slow, jerky steps toward the fence and speaking in lifeless voices that reverberated throughout the schoolhouse all around us saying, “Miss Krystin. Miss Krystin.” (My mother’s name) They just kept repeating that as they climbed the fence like a couple of spiders. My mom was pacing back and forth covering her ears crying, “I don’t know you, I don’t know you”.. When they make it over the fence they stop and stare. Everything goes quiet and they say in unison, “We know you.” And I wake up with my heart pounding, breathing hard and shaking. It was the first time since I was 6 that I got up to sleep in my mom’s bed. It was horrifying. I have no idea what it might’ve meant. I know that it’s not unheard of to have nightmares about something you watched or listened to before going to sleep but it was the same exact dream.

238,I dreamt everyone died to a song I had never heard,6,dgg4qr,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/dgg4qr/i_dreamt_everyone_died_to_a_song_i_had_never_heard/,2,"I used to have lots of nightmares as a kid. Standard stuff like monsters and darkness. It began to slow down as I reached middle school and then happened once in a blue moon throughout high school. I can’t remember the last nightmare I had, but this, this was horrifying.

The dream starts with my immediate family (mom, dad, younger brother) visiting a cabin with a family I did not recognize. They didn’t have any children but it was a married couple who seemed to be the same age as my parents, so late forties early fifties. I’ll call them Jane and Robert for clarity sake. The cabin was implied to be theirs based on their familiarity with it in the dream, but I did recognize the cabin when I woke up as my friend’s cabin, a place I had visited every summer for the past few years. Anyway, back to the events.

Though I had never had a dream like this prior, my brother and I both knew to watch for “the man outside.” Our rooms had two large windows and we spent a good part of the beginning of the dream looking outside, fearful he may be out there and wanting to see him before he saw us. We were called downstairs soon after where things started to act up.

The Cabin next door to us had one of those huge windows that takes up the entire wall and let’s you see everything outside. Not sure what the neighbor had been doing, but I recall Jane yelling about how Robert hadn’t come home and it was probably the neighbor’s fault. It gets a bit fuzzy here but Jane calls the neighbor, who I can clearly see from his large window, and watch him pick up his phone and talk to Jane. Things then go dark.

It suddenly flashes to night time. My brother and I are eagerly awaiting for Stranger Things Season 4 to drop and we have the tv all set up. Just as soon as we hit play, things act up in the house, immediately distracting us from the first episode. We notice shadows running by our window, and we know it’s the man outside. We rush downstairs to tell our parents who seem to be already aware. Robert hadn’t come home, and now we knew why. Delicately hung against the screen door was his body, the back of his head blow out behind him. Jane pulls out her phone again and says Robert’s name, only for her own brains to suddenly spew out behind her, as it some invisible force had yanked them out. My brother and I scream and run to a corner room, while our parents panic in the kitchen.

Even though it had only happened once, I realized the pattern was if you say the name of the person who just died, then you would be next, like a domino effect. Before I could tell my parents this, I heard my Dad call 911 and tell them “Jane’s head blew out.” I immediately ran to grab my brother when I heard my mom scream. Instead of having blown our brains, my dad’s head seemed to have purple veins spreading over it. He angrily grabbed my mom, throwing her against the wall. 

We ran back to the corner room and locked the door, crying and shaking. Even though it had only felt like a few moments, the first episode of Stranger Things was over. That’s when I heard the song. I remember the rhythm and tone, but that’s hard to convey. The lyrics are a blur, but I do remember one lyric: “Your heart is magic.” The voice was a male’s, relatively deep, and somber. The lyric repeated in a slow and soft rhythm as my brother and I cried in the darkness, only lit up my the tv. 

Then I woke up. I wasn’t shaking, crying, or gasping. It was a very calm awakening. And yet I felt very tense, and I couldn’t get the lyrics out of my head. I didn’t know that song, at least I was certain I had never heard it. Googling the lyrics led to nothing, making me think I had misheard. How could such a distinct rhythm, voice, and lyric come together and stay crystal clear. It’s been an hour now since I woke up and I keep thinking about the song more than any other horrific thing that happened in that dream.",1570833656.0

I could fully see the skeletons coming for me but no matter how hard I tried to escape I couldn't move, I was frozen and they'd grab me and pull me away. I have been researching types of dreams and their meaning and apparently chasing skeleton dreams mean that there was a dark past or haunting events that happened in ur life which u tried to suppress, but are now impacting you.

240,Dream of a malfuntioning heart,4,dgfxfa,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/dgfxfa/dream_of_a_malfuntioning_heart/,0,"A few days ago I had a dream that I was killed with some type of horn stabbing into my heart. I remember feeling the pain of it very vividly and I remember thinking ""this is what it feels like to die?"" I was somewhat okay with dying but I tried screaming out to my family who were a bit further out to warn them just in case there was a chance I could *not* die but no sound came out of my mouth, then I woke up. 

Last night, I dreamt about having a hernia in my heart? I didn't know what a hernia was before looking it up this morning, so it doesn't make sense but anyway as a result of this hernia I had a giant accordion tube coming out of my chest (connected to my heart). It needed to be changed all the time and it had to be quick because I would stop breathing and my heart stopped beating. (I always link death with the feeling of suffocating or drowning idk why) the first few times some fictional person I trusted took care of it but later every time it needed to be changed there were tons of people around but no one would want to help even if they saw that I was dying. I didn't know how but people would just say I had to learn to do it myself and others didn't want to get involved so they looked away. 

In these dreams it's always the same pain. For the last three weeks though I've been having panick attacks that include the same sort of pain. Sharp heart cramps and a heavy weight and tightness in my chest with difficulty breathing. Are my dreams just me having a panick attacks/heart cramps in real life and my brain is just supplying images? Or is there something my subconscious is trying to tell me by physically hurting me and giving me these dreams? I just want to know what these mean.",1570832722.0
241,Disturbing dream about the castle siege,1,dglt2j,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/dglt2j/disturbing_dream_about_the_castle_siege/,0,"Well, i was dreaming about being a general, besieging a medieval castle. Normally i would defeat defenders on the walls and then head for the inner keep to fight royal guard. But this time i bypassed fighting on the walls and streets and went straight for the throne room. I ran into the king there. He was armed and ready for the fight. We were fighting violently for a while. I was very tired so I needed to end this fight quickly. Eventually i took a swing into the gap under his helmet i took his life.  

When people outside learned that king fell, enemy knights gave up the castle and swore truce. They knew they were overpowered. And even if they would able to defend, death of the king meant internal problems of power transition. So they gave up.  

I went on a stroll down the street, but people of the city were very hostile, two of them tried to kill me. A blacksmith attacked me with hot metal bar that he was forging, but i dodged and called the guards. I went to the Main Gate. The bridge of this gate was ruined (blown up?), therefore gate itself was useless. So they used it for dumping the corpses into the huge crater outside the gate.

Now, spiritual part starts. I was presented with what appeared to be stripped naked, body of the king, with no blood, just pale, dead body. Somehow I knew, it was his spirit or something. I needed to kill it as well to be fully done with my victory. Then i needed to dump the spirit of the gate, first binding it some kind of other body. So i reached for his chest i i started touching it hard, i was touching this dead body, for the pleasure of realizing that he finally, really is dead. Grabbing his dead, pale chest like that was a final spit in his face, cuz he was dead, he could not react. I took my knife and stabbed the stomach. Blood and guts spilled over his belly. I went with the blade higher, to the chest and i ripped it open. I heard some loud screaming in the nearby room. Never mind. Blood was everywhere, on his pale, gray skin. Then i took the knife, and went back to the lower body, cutting all the way to the level of the hips. I thought about cutting open his scrotum and penis, just to castrate the corpse, but i was like, whatever. Then i dumped his spirit, which immediately entered some very, very small body, then slipped outside from the gate to the crater.  

I entered nearby room where the screaming was coming from. The dungeon. My exorcist advisor, whose name i cannot recall, was busy sealing some spirits in the prison. When I woke up, I remembered his name, even wanted to use it in my book because it had a very gentle ring to it. But I forgot. Me killing king's spirit was also his instruction. I met a young girl there. She was a bit sad, but her eyes were fixed on one point, like as she was in some kind of trans of something. She said:

*- Hello my new king.*

*- Hello* \- i answered *- i heard screaming here. Was it you?*

*- Yes. I gave birth to a sad baby. But i already killed it and dumped down the gate. And now, I can be REAL MAID!*

Being shocked that this kid just killed it's own baby, I wanted to do something about it but soon realized that my exorcist probably ordered her to do this, so king's dead spirit can enter baby's body and be gone. He probably filled her with a little story so she won’t be too traumatized. So i kept silent, even tho the thing she did was awful. After this we went on a walk around the dungeon, seeing spirits and demons of various forms. One was like a cloud of grayish rectangles, swarming in the cage, the other one was anthropomorphic, at least 5 meters tall. The exorcist was sealing them in the dungeon, but a lot of little ones were floating around, and I had a power to shove them into the cages. My young companion said she doesn't like it.

*- My master, the exorcist is evil, he is doing evil deeds.*

She was actually using his first name, and it sounded disturbing in her mouth.

*- Calm down young one - I was comforting her - exorcist has very important job here. We need to be safe from these demons.*

The atmosphere was very dense and scary. There was this unsettling sense of danger and unrest. A lot of spirits screaming in the cages. On the way back I caught one small demon, which looked like a little gray jelly, and shoved it into the cage. Maybe it was really my power, or it was the presence of the exorcist.

*- My master* \- said the girl *- i see now, this work here is very important for our safety, this is exactly why you shouldn't trust the exorcist!*

The last thing i remember, is getting dizzy, feeling dark and evil presence, and the view of girl screaming:

*- The exorcist is untrustworthy, he is evil!*",1570859122.0

I went back out, the lights were still in the sky and suddenly me and a few friends, along with my sister, were in my garage and they said this has been happening for the past week. 

I went inside and my dad and I were going somewhere, he was on the computer and saying we were gonna go get more food and stuff for the plane. I had the feeling we were moving out. I grabbed my bag and I went to my room, packed things that are close to me and I went upstairs, then I woke up.

I also have exceptionally ""long"" dreams, and dreams within dreams. My dream world is so consistent and real that I'm starting to wonder if it's actually a parallel universe.

My dreams usually last for several days or a week in ""dream time"", but I've had ones that lasted for what seemed like months. In my dreams, I remember everything that happened in previous dreams - every bad experience, every good experience. I have a whole different set of memories.

My dream world consists of many countries and cities and they're always the same, same layouts and everything. I dream in the same place until I travel within a dream (for example, if I travel to Japan in a dream, I will be in Japan for all the following dreams until I travel again).

It's scary how consistent the dream worlds are. It's scary how consistent my memories are, too. If something horrible happens to me in a dream, I'll be suffering from the trauma of it for the next year or two of dreaming. It shapes who I am in the dream world.

Another interesting thing is that I have franchises and brands in my dreams that don't exist in real life, but are constantly updated in my dreams. For example, there's a movie series in my dreams called ""ripping through the shadows"" and it's on its fifth installment. Whenever a new installment comes out (usually once every 6 months) I'll go see it in theatres.

I literally feel like my dreams are more real than the reality I'm in. The only thing that reminds me that they're just dreams is that in unable to hurt myself - and I really try. I'm suicidal in real life, so I'm suicidal in dreams too. I often try to hurt myself but it doesn't work. The other people in my dreams can be hurt/killed, but I can't.

I can give more details if you want.

256,Two recent dreams that are focused on angry ocean/flooding,2,dgfrla,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/dgfrla/two_recent_dreams_that_are_focused_on_angry/,0,"I’m sitting down on a bench waiting to get called into court for some minor traffic issue when I realize the dude next to me is Robert Sapolsky, a neuroendocrinologist who has published a lot of great work and teaches at Stanford. He’s a really funny professor and I was watching a lecture of his on YouTube last night. In the dream, we talk a bit and I ask him if he’ll be teaching any classes in the future, but he says he’s too old. Disappointment. 

Then, one of my current teachers comes up and asks to talk with me in private. I’m nervous, because why in private? When we’re alone, she starts to cry and says that she’s worried she’s messing up the class curriculum and that the first exam was a mess. A bunch of students and I felt the exam was not accurate IRL, so I felt relieved that maybe she’d grade leniently. 

When I sit back down, I realize that I was supposed to go into the courtroom and sit down hours ago, and I’ve missed my court date. 

I leave with my parents and we teleport to a farm. This is where things get weird. The farm is on the beach, on the sand far from the water. To get down to the farm/beach, you have to walk down these stairs because it’s like a big wooden platform away from the water, like the way ocean front homes are designed. When looking at the farm, I admire the cute cows and the ocean. Then suddenly, while fully registering the image in front of me, I see massive waves throwing the cows everywhere. It’s like a tsunami, and the cows are crying. There’s also a horse getting swallowed and thrown around by the waves. The farmers are trying to save them but they’re also getting thrown around. (I read an article IRL about a man who was electrocuted while trying to save his horse during a flood). I panic because i want to help but don’t know how. The suffering makes me feel so much dread. Then, a massive wave launches two of the cows up on the wooden platform I’m standing on, and I go over to them. One of them immediately shits, and I feel so sad because that could mean he’s dead. But then he coughs, and water comes out. I go up to them and pet them, and they are so happy. LMFAO they are happy like my dogs, and I just stay with them because I’m amazed they’re alive. 

In a dream I had a few days ago, angry ocean was also involved. My boyfriend and I were trying to evacuate from some disaster when the road in front of us was covered in water. Even though it looked relatively shallow, I said no. He drove through anyway, and we got trapped. Massive tsunami waves start coming down on us and at some point I’m out of the car, getting launched up in the air from the waves. When I look down, I feel the terror of knowing that when I land, I will break my leg on something underneath the water and drown, then die. But when I land, I’m somehow fine, though struggling to stay afloat and breathe.

And then suddenly, the waves calm down, and I shove him out of the driver’s seat. I back out (and actually check my mirrors, which I feel like I never would do or remember doing in a dream?) and drive home. When I get home, I drive my car up the stairs (wtf?) and park it on my top floor in my house. I feel a sense of safety and relief. 

That’s it.",1570831988.0

We hope someone here could help us find answers.

She starts in a car, with her sister driving both of them to the sister's boyfriend's house. They arrive at a really tall building, about fourteen stories. This is realistic to the actual building she has visited.

She gets out of the car, and the sister says she got a parking ticket. When walking to the front doors of the building, she notices a girl hanging herself from the second-floor balcony. (In the latest dream, the girl was hanging from the first floor.)

She then looks up and sees a man jump off the edge of the building, and land dead in the parking lot. (In the latest dream, the man lands on top of the sister's car, also dead.)

When inside, the front desk lady and a male detective inform her that the girl had killed herself because she was raped. There was no explanation given for the man.

The front desk woman and detective man tell her that she is responsible for the people dying. Not as if she committed the crime, along the lines of ""this is all your fault."" Then she wakes up.

It was like the ocean ran thru the woods where my family lived growing up, the trees surrounding us were extremely tall, I can’t really explain it well but it was like the water was in a T shaped path, I was on one path facing the path in front of me where my parents boat was, and the path in the middle had my sisters boat. I’m terrified of the ocean and lakes, I would never jump in the water in reality, but I did in my dream, I felt nothing being in the water, the waves were wild but it didn’t move anything, from the outside the waves looked like they were raging but in the water if I hadn’t swam to the side of my sisters boat I would’ve stayed completely still. I don’t know what possessed me to go into the water but going up to my sisters boat there was a flipped over red shaft, and a body with its head facing down. I wasn’t scared, I just grabbed it’s wrist and pulled it away from the side of the boat, it looked like it was being pulled underneath. I’m not quite sure how I flipped it over, but when I moved the wet hair out of the way, I saw myself. I was dead. I don’t know what happened after that, I just remember waking up. 

I’ve been struggling with depression and recently my family has become aware. Could this be because of that? I don’t know how to interpret this, I don’t know what it means.

It's basically 35 years in Victorian London, birth to death.

I was born a boy into a noble family of buisnessmen I'm pretty sure. I can see it all in my mind, but I can't explain it very well. I'm an only child, as far as I know.

At age about 10, I pick up a love for poetry and literature, not counting and buisness. My family are furious when they find out and burn or sell all of my novels and non-buisness related books.

At 15, I pick up that love again, except this time I hide it better. At 16, I fall in love with a gardener of the household. We ran away into the city in the early dusk of winter, the day after I turned 17.

I become a poet, he is still a gardener, but part-time in a different and smaller household.

Poetry doesn't sustain me enough, so I begin working as a train conductor when I'm about 25 under an alias. You know, checking tickets, screaming 'all aboard' when the train is about to leave, etc. In my free time I still write poetry and short stories inspired by the never sleeping Victorian city. I married a girl who moved from the countryside that raised to be a housewife. Had a few kids, but there was never anything romantic. I lied about longer work nights and going to an inn to drink, when in reality, I fucked the gardener, talked about life, etc. Anything a gay couple would do in 18th century London. Just like Oscar Wilde.

10 years go by, still madly in love with the gardener. But someone (probably my wife) ratted on us that I'm a runaway noble and that I practice homosexual acts with a common servant.

I was executed by hanging the next week after refusing treatment for being gay and not wanting to return to my parents, as well as collapsing their entire buisness because they had no other heirs and my father grew too ill to manage it. And because he trusted no-one, it imploded.

I'm a bi guy leaning toward men, so thats where the gay comes from. This could be a past life or something, IDK.",1570839021.0

Now, for a little backstory, I served in the military for several years and married military so I moved away from my tiny hometown of 800 people and haven't been back except for the occasional visit. 

I regularly have this dream... or rather it's a different dream everytime but I always end up at the same place. I don't really recognize it as being somewhere in the real world but dream me recognizes it as the way into my hometown. It's a bridge with pine trees on a steep bank on one side and a body of water on the other. The bridge is always out with big signs warning that the bridge is under construction. 

I am never with the same people when we approach the bridge and sometimes I'm alone. I have been in every vehicle you can imagine when I approach the bridge. Sometimes I try to maneuver the bridge (go around, get up my speed and try to jump the gap, climb down and try to climb up the other side, etc.). Sometimes I just turn around and try to find another way into town. I never get into town before I wake up.

Some I have remembered for years.

Throughout my day though, if my brain is idle and I’m not thinking of anything in particular I will get snapshots of dreams. Some years old, ones I hadn’t thought of for literally years. I can recall moments from, if I had to guess, on a good day, maybe 50-70 different dreams. But regularly, probably 15-20.

I used to have a job where I did something very monotonous for hours, and they would all pop into my head, one after another for as long as I was working. And it would just be a flash. A color scheme of a room accompanied by a feeling. Or an entire sequence of a story. Memories of physical touch. All of these flashbacks are very vivid for me, even if I can’t recall the exact scene in the dream. As I’m writing this I just had 4 pop into my head. 

I’m wondering if anyone else experiences something similar?

271,The World Spider (Series) (Night 2),3,dgceai,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/dgceai/the_world_spider_series_night_2/,0,"**This is the second in the series of dreams.**I have returned to stand before the spider, but this time all is not as silent as before. It is cold, dark, but not quite quiet and not quite lonely. I look around me and I am flanked on all sides by men and women bearing tattoos of the spider. Tattoos imprinted on their foreheads seem to move, bowing before the spider itself. The people are doing as the spider wills, but not, seemingly, from its direct command.  


But while the tattoos of the spider bow before it, the Children of Man bow before me. I see through their eyes, a completed vision giving me a third-person sight of my own naked body. A massive tattoo of the spider covers my entire back. Two of the tattoos legs reach out to my limbs. Two legs per arm, two legs per leg. The tips of the legs end on opposite sides of my limbs, a spider leg ending on the front and another on the back of my shoulders, the same for my hips. Chains connect to the ends of the spider's legs, spiraling down my arms and legs to end at a shackle tattooed around my wrists and ankles  


.It is then that the spider speaks to me and a compulsion wracks my body. I fall to my knees and bow my head before the entity before me as it speaks in a voice steeped in power. The ancientness of the spider echoes in my mind with the voice that I can not hear, erasing the doubt of its power as it washes over me. Like a good servant, I bathe in the power of its voice and heed its every word. Doting diligently on them with every bit of my attention.  


The spider gives no commands, no cryptic verses, no demand to be worshipped. Rather… it tells me a story. It tells me a story of an empty void with only it to occupy the endless nothingness. It tells me of how it saw the potential for many things to exist, and in the infinite eons between then and not long ago, it spun a web. A web that spans the universe... Neigh… a web that MAKES the universe. The twinkling morning dew hanging from the delicate yet infinitely grand strands of silk made the galaxies, and all that exists in between made the worlds and stars that occupy our universe.  


I see in that moment that the web spun by this spider is something grander than I could ever imagine. The very cosmos… I weep. Not in pity for the spider being trapped. But out of woe that anybody would want to trap something so beautiful. But then I see it. As the Children of Man bow to me, and I bow to the spider, a chain is completed. No names exist on the chainlinks and again the spider has will over its own silk. The Earth itself shakes, the abdomen shuttering causing landslides as the web snaps. Out of the Earth shoots the leg, seemingly moving slowly due to its size, but moving faster than any human could hope too even with the assistance of technology.  


I stare in awe, the Children of Man around me exclaiming as one of the legs is freed. As it happens I feel a strange sensation pass over me, a chill up my spine, the feeling of waves hitting my skin. I see in the eyes of the Children of Man that my tattoos are moving with the spider. The abdomen tattoo is raised from my back and one of the chains on my right arm is broken. Now a very real chain is linked to my arm and hanging to the ground. I barely noticed that it transitions smoothly from metal to tattoo as it meets my skin, I am too absorbed in the voice of the spider congratulating me for my hard work.  


As it says this I hear my voice leaving my mouth, repeating the same to the Children of Man. I feel stronger, and in that strength, I sense the gift of the spider offering me whatever I wish so long as I continue my “hard work”. Before I can really take this in… I see it… Specifically, I see her. An elderly woman sitting upon the leg of the spider, rocking back and forth on its leg and knitting something I can’t quite see. But as my vision clears it becomes obvious what it is she is knitting. It’s the link of a chain, made from the silk of the grand spider before me.  


I take in her form. But unlike the spider, I feel greatly disconnected from her. The elderly lady is spiderlike as well, with eight unfeeling eyes staring out at me from under a shawl. Two legs keep her on the spider, six arms work simultaneously to knit the new chain.In that moment I feel the waking world welcoming back to consciousness. But I feel anger at the sight of this woman stealing the silk of the grand spider to trap it. No greater insult can exist. I wake up with the desire to free the spider before it can be bound again.",1570813259.0

This man was in an old antique diner having a meal. He was close friends with the owner, so had a special seat right by the bar. 
After finishing up his meal, he realized the diner was surprisingly empty. 3 tall men in suits walk in. Bald head, stocky, at least 6 ft 2 each. 
They walk up to the man, kindly but firmly, shake his hand. The man said ... I'm not looking for trouble, I'm just going to see myself out now... The man exits the diner through the back door

As the man walks to his car, he looks up to the sky, only to see a small 2 passenger plane on fire, crashing down to earth! It crashed in the middle of a 4 lane road, relatively close to where he parked his car. As he goes to his car to get out of there he realizes he should try to help. He decides to do his best and help people involved in the crash. As he approaches the airplane, he realizes there's probably gasoline in the plane, and plane is on fire! He does a full 180 and sprints away. The plane blows up as he's sprinting for safety. 

After the plane blows up, he goes back and tries to help people who were in the cars when the airplane dropped. But those cars are now catching on fire too. The man decided it is best to wait a little bit and move his car away, to a safer distance. As chaos begins to unravel, he sees people on fire, running towards other people and attacking them. He’s watching the carnage unfold from a safe distance. He sees people who aren't on fire, full on Olympic sprinting, chasing other people and tackling them, and attacking them. BITING THEM  🧟‍♂️ Quickly he makes the connection and realizes this is a Zombie Apocalypse. 

He puts his car in reverse, drives through the diner, drives through the back Door, smashes the wall, to avoid the accident, and does a great freaking left turn drift on to the highway. There's a massive cliff just after the last traffic light. He realizes that now there are zombies everywhere. He calls his wife, telling her they're going up north to the wives mothers house, to fill up gas and stock up on groceries before the news spread! He passes the cliff on the highway, and his on his way to get his wife!

Luke (Gilmore Girls) is my mom's boyfriend. He got injured, and is housebound for the day but set to go back to his regular schedule the next day. It's his birthday coming up that weekend, and some people from Stars Hollow are gathered together planning a party and are wondering how to get everything set up without him noticing. I mention something about my mom keeping him busy. 

We are now at my grandparent's old house, introducing Luke to my mom's side of the family. Something I say or do causes me and my mom to fight, so I lock myself in the bathroom. I then start pleasuring myself (???) first just manually but then also with the handle of a hairbrush that I can only insert in about a centimeter before I hit some kind of ""wall"" preventing me to put it any further. 

My mom then comes back screaming at me, saying she knows what I'm doing. I freak out and get everything straightened out, and when I get out, she says something about how I've been doing inappropriate things to a toddler. There's a psychologist in the kitchen who has diagnosed me with some sort of ""lesbian love disorder"" (those aren't the exact words there are a couple psychology words in between lesbian and love that I can't remember), but the gist of the disorder is that I, as a lesbian (actually bi, but didn't correct) who hasn't ever been in a romantic relationship, nor hasn't had any loving moments with anyone else recently, thought it was appropriate to project those feelings onto a little girl, because if I did certain things to her, then she would love me back.

Then it turned into a discussion onto why it was ok (to the psychologist) for a 15yo boy to have sexual relations with someone with a large age difference (think like 10 years here), but it wasn't ok for girls. Don't ask for any arguments for or against, I can't remember any. 

The next few moments are viewed like CCTV footage. A group of me and 5 or 6 people and myself are gathered in the kitchen. We step outside for a moment, and when we come back in, an extra person is with us. He's dressed in an all-tan umpire uniform. He even carried a wooden baseball bat.

I don't know how, but it took me a moment to realize he was there. I was totally calm when I pointed him out (I'm creeped out by him now, he looked totally creepy), but then I ended up asking him if I could choose who to kill. He nodded, and I pointed to all but myself and two people. How did he kill them, you may ask? With a baseball bat. And somehow I managed to touch the baseball bat, which would make me suspect to investigation. 

I then run off with the 2 other survivors where we sit in a field just outside the city.

283,Terrifying False Awakening Loop,2,dgb682,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/dgb682/terrifying_false_awakening_loop/,1,"I just woke up from another loop of terrifying false awakenings. I went down for a nap, and was out for just over an hour, but the dream felt like hours upon hours.

In it, I'd gone down for this same nap, aware that my fiance finishes at 9pm but will be visiting his parents before coming home (all true). The first time I 'woke up', I was feeling really groggy and spacy, and I didn't really know what I was doing but I was tearing up paper next to the bed. Then I woke up again. I could hear people in the house but felt too groggy to do anything. I was fighting my body, but it didn't want to move. I had a blindfold on (in real life I'd gone to sleep with a sleep mask) and I fought my arms to peel it off, and I could see the room with the torn paper from before but no voices from people in the house. That tipped me off that I was having false awakenings.

So from then on, I was aware that I was having these dreams full of dread, and knew I just had to wait for my partner to get home. So I still have awakenings, but I remember that the past ones have happened and they feel relevant to the current situation. When he is home (like when we sleep at night), I know I can start screaming in terror at this point and eventually it'll come out of my actual body and he'll actually wake me up. In the dreams, it's like I try to scream but nothing comes out, so I try and try again, until it's loud enough to""break through the dream"".

I tried screaming, in case I'd slept until my partner got home, but my voice was so hoarse. Then I woke up again. Still filled with dread. I tried to wander through the house, and I kept pulling at the thing on my eyes. I could see, but I knew what I was seeing wasn't real. Occassionally when I could pull the thing off my eyes, I could see our real house, and that's when I tried grounding techniques. But then it went again, so I just screamed in terror. Woke again. Repeated. And again. And again.

I was then aware that my phone was near me as I slept, so in this haze of terror, I tried grabbing it. It wasn't any use because I was a mix of groggy and stuck trying to pull the blindfold off. I tried using voice commands to call my partner, but again, my voice was hardly working. I felt terrified. Awake again. It's dark now, surely he'll be home soon. I try screaming again, but it's so hoarse. I then hear my phone ringing and am so grateful. I manage to answer it, and it's my partner saying he's just leaving work. I try screaming things like ""help"" "" stuck"" and ""dream"" because I know that my real world partner will know I'm caught in a night terror and come home to help. But it's silent on the phone, I think because my voice wasn't working.

Snap awake again. My housemate that moved out earlier this week is in the house. I try screaming, and it doesn't work. I get up, groggy and blindfolded but seeing a 'false' house. I'm feeling along the walls, trying to scream, hoping that outside of the dream, she's actually in our house and I'm actually screaming and sleepwalking. But I pull off the blind and see the house is empty. Awake again. I try fumble through the house again screaming and pulling at the blindfold. Awake again. I groggily try to move off the bed covered in shredded paper and all the things I knocked over in previous attempts to get help, and I just sob. But then I hear the front door and hope to God it's my partner here to wake me up - maybe the phone call happened in real life. Try to get up screaming. Wake up. I hear the door again, and try screaming. I try and try and he's not hearing. But then he walks into the room and his face drops as he asks what happened. The dream then turns, and all of a suddensuddena winged evil creature version of himself on top of me. I scream as loudly as possible and...

Finally wake up for real. Day time. Covered in sweat. Heart racing. My dream had gone on from at least 3.30pm to 11pm when he was home, so I checked the time and it'd only been an hour. I'm more exhausted then when I went to nap. The heat from the pounding heart has worn off now, so now I'm covered in sweat and freezing. The worst part is that this isn't uncommon for me. I started prazosin for it about 6 months ago, currently on 2mg, but these types of dreams are breaking through. It's definitely exhausting.",1570804613.0
284,the skilful man - dream story,1,dgd3t9,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/dgd3t9/the_skilful_man_dream_story/,0,"i had an interesting bitter sweet dream last night.

i was a young guy who had the power to run fast and skilfully. i met a band of teenagers who were trying to give pop bottles and other bits and bobs to a charity event but they wouldn't allow them cause they caused trouble by not doing it right. things were unorganised, wires were tangled it was a mess. so i decided to help them out. i organised them, untangled the wires and set them up so they wont get tangled again and i set up a system which could run with my running skills. i ran and ran and they eventually succeeded.

it kept going for years until they had a prosperous business and didn't need my help anymore since they invented machines which do the job for me. i wasn't needed so i felt i was needed elsewhere so i said goodbye. they begged me to stay so i told them a story of a previous place i had been. in the past i helped a race of eagles which lived in the water but they couldn't swim very well. i swam graciously to help them. then they invented boats and forgot about me since i wasn't needed.

i went elsewhere in sadness to find a race of giant ogre like people who lived in the jungles which were having troubles of their own. i helped them learn how to travel their home by swinging on the vines and helped them make friends with a local tribe which had a business which was failing so they could work together and everything was well. i left before they noticed as were too happy now to notice, they didn't need me anymore. i realised there is other places i am needed so i don't need to worry about staying and eventually i will find my true place.

so i left the teenagers and went to the skies. in the skies there were a race of sea creatures and it was like the beach but in the sky with clouds. they were also trying to make a business run by swirling clouds into shapes of bottles of ketchup and soup and other products. i helped them change the colours of the clouds and swirled them by flying gracefully in the sky as usual. they adored me and the business grew and grew as it did before until people barely noticed me as it was so busy but i didn't feel unloved this time.

and one day, as i was busy helping out, a little young woman flickered her eyelashes at me. i was surprised as i never had a reaction to me to be anything like that before. i shifted over and we got chatting. she said she fancied me and one thing led to another and years later we got married and had 3 children. 2 girls and a boy. when the first girl was a young teenager, the second girl about 10 years old and the boy about 4 i disappeared never to be seen again. my wife cried to my children asking why but my children didn't cry. my children reminded her of the things i had said many times. how i was helping cause my powers were needed in the world and there is always a sorry soul i need to help. if i stopped it would be unfair on the ones who needed me. this was my purpose in life. my wife understood and smiled through her tears. the end

it was told like a story with some parts being able to be done by my own body but in the mind of the character and other parts like the ending being told through a story book with watercolour illustrations. it was bizarre but i got great feeling of sadness, joy and eventually satisfaction throughout. i feel like i have watched a beautiful movie.",1570817930.0

Do you sometimes have “flashbacks” to these dreams randomly while awake?",3,dg9q2i,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/dg9q2i/do_you_feel_a_certain_consistent_emotion_in_some/,0,"Hello, everyone.
I’ve been deeply obsessed with this emotion I get sometimes when I dream. I only really get it (or remember it) when I have dreams so vivid, they feel like real life. Since they’re so realistic, sometimes I get ‘flashbacks’ randomly during the day. During these ‘flashbacks’, I first feel the emotion or feeling I get during the dream very strongly for a few seconds and then I remember certain details of the dream. Sometimes I remember dreams I have completely forgotten about and haven’t had in months or even years. Sometimes the details are vague and hazy, while other times they’re crystal clear. I enjoy the emotion, somewhat, and I do tend to seek it out. It’s a very addicting feeling, but it also has a dark side to it as well. I am not sure how to describe it, I feel like attaching any type of label or comparison to it would taint your understanding of it, although I guess I would say it’s similar to nostalgia or even melancholia at times, but it’s much more complex than I can understand. It’s extremely confusing but intriguing to me. 
I was wondering if anyone else experiences this as well. Not a day goes by where I don’t think about this feeling and why I get it when I dream. 
I’ve been obsessing over this for years, it has even caused a bit of inner turmoil in my life, but I do overall enjoy sleeping and dreaming because of it.

2. I had a dream that i went to visit my old high school, i was walking around the campus till i arrived at a newly constructed building, i went up the new building's stairs and found my way to a bathroom stall, i remember checking out the doors and thought to myself, ""what kind of new building is this?"" since some of the stall doors are broken. Back to real life, about two weeks later, i visited my hometown for Christmas break, My mom asked me to go with her to my high school where my brother now goes to for a parent-teacher meeting. So we arrived and it has been about 3 years since I last visited the school, we were headed towards a new building, I thought to myself, this feels like deja vu. Then i remembered the dream. I asked my brother, is your room upstairs? he said, ""yeah"" My mind was full of anticipation as we went up the stairs. I told my brother that I had a dream about this place, He says ""What?"" As we were walking up the stairs, ""I've been here already."" I said to myself. Then I told him, ""Is there a bathroom at the end of these stairs?""  And at the end of the stairs there was a bathroom door. I turned to my brother and asked ""are the doors inside made of wood and some are broken?"" And I saw his eyes glow open in amazement as he said, ""how did you know??"" and i went, ""i'm psychic"" jokingly

289,"Assault helicopters, monsters, and some very big hand guns",1,dgbicm,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/dgbicm/assault_helicopters_monsters_and_some_very_big/,0,"After getting spotty sleep last night, I decided to take a nap earlier this evening since it was my day off and I don't have to work early tomorrow. At the point I became aware of dreaming, it was around 3am in the dream and I had gotten up to go to the bathroom when I heard a strange noise. It sounded like the wash from a helicopter propeller. I go into my laundry room, peek through the blinds covering the window, and managed to see a small, black military assault helicopter (like you would see in FarCry 5, for example) with dual gatlings on it, absolutely no running lights, and it is flying at maybe 200ft above ground level, circling the street in front of my house. ""What the hell?!""

My grandmother and mother are in the dream, and I struggle to get them to stop being stubborn, listen to me, and get in one of the bedrooms at the back of the house. Making sure all the lights are off, I peek out through the living room blinds just as this helicopter opens fire on something on the street. All I can see is a car parked on the street out front, it's doors open, but no occupants in sight, when chunks of concrete explode upward as high velocity rounds rapidly strike the sidewalk and trace up to hit something out of sight.

I yell for everyone to get down and stay in the back room, then heed my own advise and take cover in the hall. Once the fire stops, I peek around the corner through the kitchen and my front door is open, but I somehow know the security door is still intact and closed. That doesn't matter, as a clawed, undead white hand curls around the edge of the open inner door and a hunching weight, with long rotting black hair, is already inside the house, somehow having phased through the steel security door. ""Ah, shit..."" I decide I don't like where this has gone and want to try a redo, so I use **Rewind** and go back several minutes.

The helicopter has just started circling, I've gotten everyone secreted into the back bedroom, and am now in my bedroom. I open a gun safe and take out my actual .45 Cal 1911, slip the two extra 10rd magazines into my left shorts pocket, insert the third and rack the slide. Safety off, I wait in the kitchen for the weight. But things go differently. The helicopter starts shooting at the weight as it is in front of my front door. My mom, stubbornly curious, wants to know what is going on and comes out of the bedroom, I yell for her to get back just as she lines up with the front door and dozens upon dozens of rounds go through the door and strike my mom. _Wait, it wasn't supposed to go like that!_ ""Crap!"" I **Rewind** the dream again.

At the point where I've gotten everyone hidden away and safe, I lock the bedroom door from the outside, and go into my bedroom. The wall opens up, the desk sliding away, showing a very cool futuristic armory like something Tony Stark would have built for the Punisher. I get these hand guns that resemble an H&K USP Match (the gun used by Lara Croft), except mine are all black with red slides, and are the size of my forearm. I load subspace magazines into four of them, the magazines drawing from a remote, infinite ammo supply that will automatically feed into the guns, holster two on my thighs and another two on my hips, the extra two being backups in case one set overheats from using full auto for too long. ""No more Mr Nice Guy.""

I go to the front door, quietly open it and the security door, then rush outside and draw a set of pistols. There are several weights who immediately take notice and move to attack me. The helicopter is already working on a pack of them up the street. I take aim and start taking down weights one at a time, my guns on full auto, but using short bursts for accuracy. I blow the head off one, the left arm and left chest of another, and so on, until there are no more weights. I check my guns for overheating and they are fine. I look up and this massive, red eyed Decepticon-like thing is hovering in the sky. ""Oh, come on...""

The helicopter is out of ammo and backs off, I somehow know backup is on the way but it won't get here in time. There are two guys on the ground in, oddly enough, S.T.A.R.S. uniforms, but they're outclassed by the hovering robot. I holster the first set of guns, draw the second, hit a switch that cycles my ammo to a different type, select full auto, and open fire on the robot. I'm actually damaging it, but it's slow going. It starts firing back at me, but I dodge it's shots, strafing left and right, and eventually outright flying into the air and dodging fire in the sky. My guns are getting hot, the bad guy still has half his health, and something starts shooting me in the back. I yell for the guys on the ground to get whatever is shooting at me, concentrating on the hovering robot. I can see three helicopters in the distance. I have to hold out just a couple minutes longer until they get here--

And the dream fades and I wake up. What the crap?! I didn't get to see the giant robot go down. I did, however, immediately realize I was breathing like I had been running, though, which is probably why I woke up. This all happened during a lousy two hour nap.",1570806843.0

My vision looked like what camera footage looked like at night. A dark green. And I was running or hiding from this guy. I didn’t see his face ( or maybe I forgot what this guy look like) but I think I remember what he wore. He wore a white shirt with sleeves that had lines over it and Kahkis.

Anyways, I was trying to run or hide or maybe both from this guy. There were stairs right in-front of the kitchen, but for some reason I couldn’t go up there. When the guy saw me, he would wrap his arms around me. Like a hug but it was more aggressive. Like he once he had me he didn’t want to let me go.

And then everything faded to snow like a television screen. Like it was my dream’s way of saying ‘Game over’. 

I would try again and again to escape from this man but It always ended with his arms around me. Tightly. Almost crushing me. Finally, I woke up from that nightmare. I know it isn’t that scary to most but that dream for some reason sticks out to me.",1570784299.0

295,Mass Shooter Dream,4,dg5dcy,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/dg5dcy/mass_shooter_dream/,3,"I had a pretty disturbing, but very realistic dream last night, where I was a mass shooter in an office building. For context, I'm female, in my 30s.

Anyways, the dream basically started with me sitting in a bathroom stall with a pistol. I was on the first floor of a large office building and was waiting for the man in the stall besude me to leave as I didn't want him to know I was there since I was a girl, and obviously had a gun.

After he left, I got my wits about me and left the bathroom, and it started. I'll spare details, but basically I worked methodically, shooting anyone who came across my path. I worked my way up the floors until about the fifth floor before I pulled the fire alarm to pick people off as they tried to leave.

In the end, I had managed to kill 60 people. I headed back downstairs and there was a walkway on the first floor between two buildings, with a mezzanine. As I was moving between buildings, I was shot by a police sniper who was in the mezzanine. I was hit in the shoulder, and was subsequently arrested. For some reason my dream spent a lot of time on this. When I was shot I fell pretty hard, started bleeding profusely and physically couldn't get up. It was the first time in my dream I was feeling emotion, and it was just frustration that my legs weren't working well and my arm was useless. I was a little worried about bleeding out, but it was more just me being mad I got shot. The police officer who shot me was an old co worker of mine in the real world, but I didn't make the connection in the dream. This was the most realistic feeling part of the dream.

My dream skipped essentially to the trial phase. My lawyer (who is a current coworker of mine in the real world) really had no defense because it was obvious I had done it. But he essentially was trying to blame the victims a bit, asking how a 95lb woman (I don't weigh that, but apparently I did in my dream) was able to kill 60 people with a pistol over the course of 45 minutes without someone just tackling her.

Then, I woke up. A little disturbed. When I was younger I had a decent obsession with mass shootings. I found them intriguing and may have been a teeny bit obsessed with researching them, but I've since grown out of that.

I had not taken any drugs, nor had i watched anything relating to a mass shooting beforehand.

Does that dream mean anything, or was it just totally random?

Edit: forgot to mention. Just before the court scene there was a quick part where I met with my lawyer. For some reason it was in my parents living room.

296,She vacuumed her insides out,5,dg39v8,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/dg39v8/she_vacuumed_her_insides_out/,0,"This is my first time on this sub. Apologize for formatting as I’m on mobile. I’m not sure if I need to add these but:

TW/CW: mention of self harm. 

I woke up genuinely disturbed about my dream for the first time in a while. 

The overall dream felt like I was watching a movie, but the main character switched between me watching the movie with a male version of me as a main character at times, and at other times it felt like I was actually experiencing the movie as myself. 

It started with me watching the “movie” as an outsider. A man and woman were taking turns in a duet of an Adele song. 

All of a sudden I’m in it, as myself, and I’m getting ready at a house with the woman from the duet, as if we are friends. Doing makeup, switching clothes, etc. then she starts singing the Adele song. And she starts slashing herself with a razor (the small kind you use in safety razors). The slashes are more like scratches, nothing deep, barely enough to make her bleed. But they’re across her chest and arms and she look happy, almost elated, as she’s singing and spinning around slashing herself. 

All of a sudden now she looks different. She’s now naked, heavy-set around the middle of her body, longer hair and looks older. Her torso is open and I stare in terror as she starts vacuuming out her intestines with a vacuum hose. Still smiling in ecstasy, still spinning around like she’s happy and dancing. She finally finished emptying herself out and is standing there, gaping open and alive. She dances across the living room, out a sliding door, and collapses in the backyard on a wooden deck. 

I woke up in the dream and described, Wizard of Oz-style to people I guess I know about the “movie” I dreamed about (“you were there, and you were there!”) The people I was talking to were the woman and the man from the beginning of the dream.",1570764997.0

Then when we got off the bus I choked the rat back up and my dad and brother also choked up rats (which I didn't know they had).

The second dream also involved driving my car and was stressful because I was really confused and foggy, as if I was high or drunk or something. I was driving in my car late at night and realized I didn't know where I was going or why I'd gotten in the car. The car windows began rapidly fogging up and it was stressful as I tried to find the defrost button and pull over. As I did that, I realized I was again in my childhood neighborhood.

One I don't remember much of the details about, but a portion of a road next to a fast food resturant was bombed and a big hole was made, about 9 feet deep. There were about 12 U.S soldiers in it, along with a man, I don't know what he did but in my dream he apparently committed a crime. In the pit with the men, seperated from them was a vat of boiling lava. The guy was then wrapped into a bag, and the soldiers grabbed shovels and piled the lava onto him.  The lava couldn't melt through the bag but the heat was still melting the guy in the bag. The lava hardened and the soldiers took all the hardened lava off, opened the bag, and he was a giant human pizza slice. A soldier then took a part of the human pizza slice and ate it, and said ""Not bad for a human."" They then proceeded to eat all the cheese off the pizza slice.

&#x200B;

The second and most disturbing one, I was in someones home, a giant metal tower where you couldn't see the ceiling. In the middle of the floor was a kitten, a puppy, and a human baby the size of a newborn pup. The baby was in a cradle, his skin was red and veiny, and his skin was wrinkled. I ducked down and talked to him like an adult would talk to a baby. I then picked up the baby in my lips, and put pressure on his head, he started crying. I started licking him and flailing him around with my lips, and I remember feeling really good about it, like the feeling you get when you have a really bad itch and you scratch it. The guy who owned the tower came in, and frowned at me. I made an excuse for why I did it and it seemed to convince him, he looked middle eastern.",1570787754.0

The first dream was that of an airplane crashing and the first time I experienced it, pieces of the plane landed in my yard but no people or anything bloody were there.

 The second time I just watched from afar as the plane crashed and I only saw smoke coming from behind the other houses on my street.

The second dream is a bit disturbing meaning that I saw my brother in my room with his neck and stomach cut open and me thinking he was dead I put something over him. After some time I went to check and he was breathing and trying to speak? and I called the ambulance but they were making fun of me. 

The same thing I dreamt last night only this time when I was calling the ambulance my mom came over and when she was panicking I told her ""don't worry, he'll be fine just like last time ( or ""ik this happened before"" something along the lines).

307,Lucid Dream...,2,dg4x24,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/dg4x24/lucid_dream/,4,"So, a brief backstory on me. I don't dream much, or if I do, I forget what I dreamed about as soon as I wake up. What's different this time is that this dream is still in my memory. Last night I had a very interesting Lucid Dream that I think I'd like to share. My dream started off with me at school. But the thing is, this school was a combination of my Elementary School, Middle School and High School. I'm not sure if this is relevant, but I'm just going to give as much detail that I can. The school was located where my Elementary School was. The building was my Middle School building and all my classmates were the ones from High School. I've been in college for a few years now, so I thought it was a little weird I could still remember the faces of my High School classmates. Anyways, I'm in class, trying to find a seat, when I looked up, and in the corner of my eye I could see that the sky was black. It was night time and I was at school. I could see the huge open field that the Football team would practice on, at at the very edge was a forest bordering the field. I didn't have to squint to tell that I could see two huge yellowish red eyes watching me from just behind the tree line. I brush it off and sit down behind a classmate, who asked me, ""you saw that too right?"" I told him I did, and we both turned to look back at the eyes in the Forest. They were gone this time. Suddenly we see a massive murder of crows quickly fly in all directions out of the forest, when suddenly this Ten to Twelve foot tall humanoid creature leaps out of the forest. This creature was covered in black fur and had horns like a dear. It was Bipedal and started running at our classroom at a tremendous speed, both me and my classmate start running out of classroom trying to escape, the whole time we were running down the halls, we could hear the screams of our classmates and the crunches of their bones as the thing was starting its dinner. My new found ""friend"" and I eventually make it out of the building and start booking it home. We lost sight of each other but I didn't care. I kept running home. As I'm running up my drive, I could see an old Christmas tree out front that was all chopped up ready for fire wood. The front door was open and I busted in. At first sight I saw my old Golden Retriever Abbey, my Dad setting up a new Christmas Tree, my little sister sitting on the couch with my dog, and my mom talking to my Nan in the Kitchen. The thing is, my Dog Abbey has been dead for some time now, and my Mom and Dad have been divorced for just as long. And my Nan, well, she moved back to England a couple years ago. I started stammering to everyone that I was being chased by something and that it's going to get us. They all asked in unison ""What?"" I told them that I had been dreaming and that something was watching me. The all looked serious, and said, ""you're dreaming..."" I remember thinking, how did they know i was dreaming? They started getting louder and louder, eventually shaking me, telling me that I'm Dreaming, and to wake up. That's when I shot out of bed in a cold sweat. I'm not sure what this dream means, or what that thing was that was chasing me, but I was hoping if i posted it here, someone could tell me, or might at least have some clue as to what might be going on? Any feed back is much appreciated.

My daydreams are less detailed than my regular dreams I'm guessing because I'm just not in deep sleep. So in my daydreams I'll do an action like throw a ball or jump and then I'll violently wake up doing the motion of that action (like a wake up swinging my arm for a throw or jumping in my seat.)  It's become a class joke now because when this happens it's noticeable and the class tries to guess what I was dreaming about from my actions. Why does my body mimic what happens in my dreams? why do I instantly jerk awake from doing these actions? and is this a problem? like an early onset of sleepwalking? Thanks",1570785481.0

&#x200B;

 It’s so dark. Dark, quiet, and cold. I’ve been walking now for what feels like days, weeks or months even. But as I crest the top of a hill I finally reach what has been calling to me all this time. Nestled in a valley surrounded by towering mountains lies the source of my fascination. A spider, monstrous in size and of an age beyond what I can fathom with my mortal mind. As I approach it its eyes open and within them, I see the trueness that is this entity before me. I see the breadth of its form. As if the spider is allowing me to witness its full shape so I might know it. The largest mountain at the end of the valley is no mountain at all but rather its calcified abdomen jutting up into the air as a testament to its might.  


  
I see eight massive legs drawn out flat against the ground, calcified from remaining still for so many centuries… Yet no plants grow upon the dirt settled on them. At the end of each leg is a massive chain bolted through the leg and traveling deep within the earth. Chains weaved not from metal, but something stronger and far older. The silk of the spider before me, the same silk used to weave the fabric of the universe, now binds this ancient creature to our world. But there is something more to the chains, something that calls to me as I find myself lost in the eyes of this entity.  


  
Engraved upon each and every link woven into the chains is a name. A full name belonging to a certain mortal who lives at the same time I do. They travel around their cities and nations in blissful ignorance, not knowing that their soul is potentially bound to the freedom of the entity before me. A voice, not quite real and not quite imagined but calm and slow, begins to speak to me as I stand there. It tells me of the ritual. The ritual that breaks the link of the chain. To bring the mortal named on the link before the spider, then make a masterpiece from the flesh and present it as an offering. With their consumption by the spider the link is made to be weak, and when every link in the chain is weakened… The spider is freed.  


  
As the waking world calls to me I feel my consciousness returning from the depths of the spider’s eyes until… I am me again… It was only a dream. But the first of many. This honestly perplexes me, and yes I wrote this like a story. As I said, it’s ongoing. I’ve had other similar dreams I might detail to you if more details are revealed.

A pastel blue VW bug parks next to me, and Patton steps out in a pink shirt with tan chinos. He starts gasping and holding his chest. He slowly stumbles toward me, one hand holding his chest, the other grasping for me as I lunge to catch him.

He falls to the ground. He’s twitching. I pull out the newspaper which has transformed into an oxygen mask. It’s not a medical mask; it looks like the kind from Avatar with the clear face mask. I put it on him and hear the hissing noise. His eyes open, wide and bright, and he sees me.

I was in the middle of a lake with dave. Dave is my moms friend whos super supportive and nice. In the dream he had a way nicer home that somewhat floated on the lake. Then there were racoons. As we were heading somewhere (there was a landbridge that connected the home with the island the house was on) several racoons junped on me. They started nawing and biting me. I feel everything as if its fucking real! The fear the pain the muscles and teeth! And he dosent do anything but tell me its nothing! 

A while later and i find some kids i dont know in that house with their mom. It looks like something straight out of im sorry john. Something terrible is attached to the back of her head and its even bigger outside the house. She starts yelling at them in an inhuman voice. Its totally unnatural in every sense and just cuts through everything! Suddenly she presses something and we get an xray view of the kids. Theres small things in their bodies activating. Little chainsaws ripping and tearing inside them and suddenly i see one of the brother lose his balls! Do you know what sound a kid makes when he loses his balls to a fucking chainsaw!?!?!?! And i woke up not only scared and panicked but depressed and sad and making sure i didn't lose anything and no one is going to fucking what im going through!

Im losing my mind irl. My depression has skyrocketed, my thoughts of self harm have increased tenfold and my nightmares have gotten so vivid I'm waking up traumatized, depressed or worse. Everytime i go to a supportive subreddit looking for help or to vent you know what happens? I get hate or ignored or lost.

Just wondering if any other lucid dreamers had this happen.",1570767172.0
323,What do you think it means?,1,dg3say,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/dg3say/what_do_you_think_it_means/,8,"I’ll try to explain this as best as I can because words don’t do it any justice. It was the weirdest dream I’ve ever had as it seemed so incredibly real.
I was 10 yrs d when I had the dream at my grandmother’s house. It started with me being in an endless expanse of blackness with people’s silhouettes all around me. I didn’t feel like I had a physical body but just a consciousness, a feeling of just ‘being’. The endless crowd of people were facing the same direction and I had the distinct feeling that we were waiting for something in anticipation. Instead of fear, I felt unbelievable content peace, comfort, and love. We were watching something that I could only be described as looking like an imax screen showing moving images. It had no sound. The image was of doctors in green scrubs and white masks walking back and forth. 
Suddenly, quicker than a blink, I was in the room with the doctors. It was unbearably bright, freezing cold, loud, and I was pissed. Then I woke up. As I laid there in bed I was very upset and angry that I woke up and tried to go back to sleep and have the dream again. To be in that loving expanse of darkness... I know what it sounds like to me but I’m curious about what it seems like to you.",1570767076.0
324,The Power of Karmic Good,1,dg3mvo,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/dg3mvo/the_power_of_karmic_good/,1,"I have been sleeping non-stop today because I wanted to keep dreaming and I have been. So in my dream the world is struck by a plague and during the current status of my dream 1/3 of the population has been killed and turned into zombies. It isn’t as heavy in America but just enough for society to have been overturned. So there is a military but since power and internet are down they can’t broadcast their rules so the military (who absorbed the police authority) have been wandering around “keeping the peace” but they’re just a high powered bully group. The world has sorta gone back to hunter-gather based groups which we in the dream called clans. And these class range from 5 people to like 100 people. But usually after that size they break into multiple or 2 different clans because when youre roaming around you can only find so much food so the bigger the group the less you eat. So I am in a clan of like 10 people. Its literally like nation-state Greece or like a video game or anything where there are bunch of small countries fighting/working together. People with groups less than 5 are pretty fucked because killing zombies is hard to organize and if you don’t have enough people to cover every direction along with someone calling the shots then youre just dead. In the dream my clan and another friendly clan are raiding this mall together. We are doing well but get driven out by zombies out the back entrance of the mall. We hadn’t gone to the back of the mall before. Since we were city clans we had a lot more organization and less brutality but towards the back of the mall was like where a more “hood” place was located and we realize in this backwoods hood place its actually safer. They have more places to run and more people that are friendly vs the city people were rude and possessive. So we start staying in the backwoods sorta trailer-park like area connected to forest. And every night there is a bonfire party, orgy, zombie killing, food sharing feast. They hold the bonfire party because it attracts all the zombies to that area. The people at the party do all the zombie killing but no one would want to go to it if it was no fun. So they give out like drugs, food, and weapons if you dont have any - there are people having orgies too there. So if you get tired of killing or eating or dancing to the music blaring on speakers connected to generators you can go closer to the fire and join an orgy. It was crazy. The mix of hard work and immediate sensual pleasures is what drove the culture of the backwoods. So people in the forrest areas were super happy and well fed, so thats why my clan stayed there. But then there was this rumor that a rival backwoods clan wanted our area. So the backwoods is run by like a governing body that controls territory and any clan can come and join the backwoods as long as they abide by territory rules and like “pay their taxes” which is were if you get a kill or collect a lot of food (animals/berries/whatever) or get good loot (find some tech or a neat useful item like a hammer or something) you give it to the government (which they document how much you give) and during the bonfire they distributed food and loot. So lets say you find/make like 5 cool weapons they might distribute those back to you for being cooperative or they might give you back 3 and take 2 as tax. If you kill a deer and give it to the backwoods - they dont give the food back but they make sure you eat, everyone eats, everynight. So like as time goes on you become sorta dependent because if you leave, you leave with like zero food since you give them all your food in exchange for safety and food everyday for you to eat so thats like the trade off - they remove the unpredictability of the zombie apocalypse by providing the general safety within the community. But this other government wanted their territory and they have this research chemical. At first we thought we were being pushed back by just mutant animals that got the zombie germs but it affected them differently but then we realized that the chemical allowed people of the Banglore (the backwoods community trying to take territory from us) take the drug and transform into these big apes (depending on your size as a human) and go in and kill our people and push us back. As we fight back tho we end up getting some of the chemical and then remaking it (this takes some weeks actually but for the sake of brevity I’ll skip the warring phases) to turn our people into warriors too. But our chemical is WAY stronger we like refined their purity and made it stronger. But this made some people turn into like GIANT animals like the size of an apartment building big. And the drug ended up destroying the government of the backwoods because people that had good reactions to the drug seemed more powerful than those that didn’t and since they had more power they were more important and people stopped listening to the backwoods and started listening to them because 1) they needed these people with good reactions to fight and protect everyone and 2) they couldn’t stop them if they tried they could just pop a pill and transform?!? They were too strong. So the governments dissolved back into tribes lead by these, so called, super-mutants. After the rise of the super mutants in the backwoods the civil unrest allowed for Banglore to make some headway. Also in conjunction with some of these super-mutants defecting to Banglore, it made fighting them nearly impossible. The government is falling apart they need more warriors that they don’t have and they can’t keep the people happy anymore so they’re basically done. So my clan is on the way out and it’s the day before this planned uprising/raid of the backwoods government before people skedaddle on out. So I go to this house party and there are people there just having fun because they want to relish the days of the backwood while its still happening and its literally like a cesspool of decadence and debauchery. Alcohol, weed, meth and any drug you want you just go to the counter and you get it - unlimitedly. The party has been going on for like 3 days now. Pretty much every girl in there is naked or with minimal clothes on and are  frivolously  fucking to the point where guys aren’t asking, they are just going up and fucking whoever they want whenever they want and the girls are high on the atmosphere and the drugs and the music and just the social aspect of it all they just take it and enjoy it because it’s the “right thing to do”. The music blaring. And like during all of this I’m filming - before the zombies I had like backed up a large part of the useful internet and still had a bunch of technologies that I remade to create like my own set of tools to access and store data. So im partly documenting everything thats happening and also using the data I have to be useful when I can without letting people know I have access to like - wikipedia or google maps and stuff. I have a video camera I go around and record stuff with also so at first this party was cool but as I was there for an hour recording the party the orgy the drugs and everything I was like fuck - this place is evil as shit this aint right the sensual pleasures are too much. So I leave and I see this house. This was the house of a guy that everyone in the backwoods hated because instead of taking part in the bonfire rituals and the culture of the backwoods he paid his taxes and he built a house out of his own hard work and just stayed to himself. It was like a big wooden cabin it was a nice house. So people felt like some type of way that he got a special house while they got community huts but he worked hard to make it on his own so the government never took it away. But this dude has knowledge and is to himself so I go over just because ik today is the last day of the backwoods realistically and I knock on his door. And he opens and immediately lets me come in. I talk with him and he tells me he knows about me from the friendly clan I worked with to raid the mall and he’s been watching me to see my character and because I am not a bad person like the people of the backwoods he would tell me a secret to winning the war and stopping the zombies. He says that he is going to die tho because the people of the house know he has the power. The leader of the house came over yesterday to make him submit and when he refused he asked for a duel outside (ape vs ape) but the the leader was a super-mutant and knew he could easily kill the man. Then when the duel started the house leader goes super the cabin guy wasn’t expecting that so he runs away and the dude squashes him like a bug. BUT right before he gets squashed  he takes his drug he’s been manufacturing. And he doesn’t die and he takes the skull of a bull and holds it and becomes a GIANT mammoth. Then he destroys the guy with his tusk. He tells me that it wasn’t the drug that was making people transform but the spirit of humanity and the power to harness energy of other things. So people party and do the backwoods shit because it gives them more power when they transform. But when you are a good person you learn to draw power from a more pure place and that gives you the ability to manifest your body and turn it into anything, not just a strong big ape. Since he didn’t have a lot of good energy he held the dead skull to bless the spirit of the animal in the afterlife and when he did the animal in return gave him good karmic energy he used to transform. Then he put his hands on my skull and I could fell the power he was talking about to transform. Oh its relevant to say that I tried taking the mutant drug to transform before but it didnt work. So then I knew why it didn’t now. It was because I didn’t have the karmic evil energy of the backwoods people to harness it into that kind of monster. But now I knew how to turn good energy into power and he said run they are coming. I ask for him to come with me and it was like a sad movie and he said he was a very very evil person and it took him a long time to learn to become good. But his karmic evil was way to high for him to overcome anymore and he had no future because of it. He had learned his nature and accepted his evil and rejected/repented for what he had done. This self-knowledge and repentance disallowed him for being able to transform using karmic evil but also he had so much karmic evil his karmic good energy was over powered. The formula is: karmic good - karmic evil = power output. Since his good was so low his evil never let it show. And since he repented he couldn’t use the power of evil anymore. I can hear the people from the party I left coming. And he says good bye and tells me to leave. And I transform into this (regular sized so they wouldnt notice as much) beautiful white and blond/golden ape and look back at him one last time and then run to my clan to tell them what happened. The crazy thing was that my whole dream is like in 3rd person but when I run away I (the me dreaming) realize that I am looking at myself from the perspective of the man that built the cabin and that told me about the power and they were coming to kill me and I had accepted my fate and as they break into my house - I peacefully wake up from sleep.",1570766462.0

Mostly i've been trying to please my flatmates which seems to reflect in my dreams, theres been a few ocassions (i was somewhat stoned which might affect things) like when i dreamt about being told to quiet down in a lengthy message when i woke up this exact thing happened, i also had a premonition when i was told to pick up a pint of milk or clean up someones mess in the kitchen.

This was weird enough but recently these dreams have taken surreal turns, last night it gradually shifted from the extremely mundane psychic predictions of daily activities to intensely graphic imagery, I was just at the shops, then suddenly i was transported to the killing fields in Cambodia, being subjected to an endless montage of kids getting dismembered.

That’s when I realized my only/first ex (only real relationship) was there too. I was shy and weirded out as I wasn’t really sure it was a dream. My ex is now married irl happily and I’m glad for her, was a while ago and have come to understand that that’s life. In the dream she appeared as a better person than the girl I was originally talking to in the dream. Anyways, a couple of event happened that didn’t relate to this story. A could was outside, and their baby seemed to be either injured or was crying as if it was really upset. Then, the mother DROPS the baby and the baby gets a bloody nose, but it seemed as if she did it on purpose and I am 99% sure it had died. Little research told me I am holding onto the past.
In the same area, I see a recognizable face but unsure of who it is. A man comes from behind him and stabs/kills him. I run and forget about this in the dream though, and continue with my ex. I don’t remember much about this but I think we were reconnecting in an emotional way but she was hesitant at parts and not attached. In the last part of my dream, right before my ex and I were gonna talk away from the other people, the same man from before comes from behind her and stabs me right as I wake up. Never been as disturbed and confused as when I woke up 10 minutes ago

  In the dream, I was alone in my kitchen, in a robe, making a homemade strawberry milkshake. First I poured the milk into the blender, then plopped in a few scoops of ice cream, sprayed a great deal of whipped cream, and carefully dropped in some strawberries. 
 
 RIGHT before I pressed the button to blend, I was suddenly transported to a 50s style diner. I was wearing a pink dress and my hair was up in standard 50s/60s fashion (I never wear pink, and I never do my hair). In front of me was a perfectly put-together strawberry milkshake, down to the artful dollop of whipped cream and cherry on top. Sitting across from me was an older man in a grey suit jacket. Nothing else was discernable about him, but I was inexplicably happy. 
  Any ideas, guys?

I haven’t slept well in a very long time, and I basically gave up on trying to fix myself because I really don’t know what the hell is wrong. I have anxiety and depression issues, and OCD, but there’s tons of people who have these same issues and don’t get terrible dreams. I’ve googled it many times and a lot of the sites say very bad dreams are often associated with PTSD and stuff like that, but I don’t have suffer from conditions such as those. 

I’ve tried a lot of things. establishing a good bed time routine, melatonin (doesn’t work for me), valerian root pills (also doesn’t work for me), trying not to watch scary movies, making my bedroom a comfortable place, not eating before bed, taking vitamins and supplements that I may be lacking, etc etc. Yet nearly every night the nightmares come. I wake up stiff and tired nearly everyday and it makes me more depressed in turn. I never get proper rest, and noticed my eye bags are getting worse. 

Anyone else suffer with this? Could it perhaps just be some sort of chronic nightmare disorder? I know many people who say they don’t dream at all, I really really wish I could be like that. This is becoming too much to handle. Like I said I already gave up on trying to cure it since I don’t know what else to do, but figured I’d try here as a last attempt. 

I don’t really want to mention what the dreams contain, since they’re quite disturbing and I try not to think about them. Thinking about them to much can cause anxiety, and/or reduce me to tears.",1570762012.0

333,I've seen an anime about a snail girl in my dream.,3,dfwhwg,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/dfwhwg/ive_seen_an_anime_about_a_snail_girl_in_my_dream/,5,"It was one of those weird dreams I have after some involuntary sleep deprivation. Last night I couldn't fall asleep till 6 a. m.

I had a dream that I was back to school. I was sat in front of a desk and my copybook was used as a sketchbook, which attracted my classmates\` attention. Among some furry sketches I drew that snail girl, which I was sure was from an anime. Overall, she was just like any regular girl, except she was a bit short and had a little spiral purple rucksack made of calcium carbonate on her back — the shell.

Meanwhile, the dream changed the decorations and I assumed the role of, again, an average (Japanese?) schoolboy in the anime about the snail girl. So, I met a (fictional) friend of mine. I asked her about that weird girl by that house over there, and she told me that snail story. ""She looks quite human"",— I said jokingly. ""No human would ever subscribe to \[???\]"",— my friend replied. And the snail girl turned around, revealing her snail traits. The snail girl, apparently, lived in a house with a human schoolgirl, who was trying to teach something her clumsy cohabitant at the moment. ""So, is she, like, her girlfriend"",— I expressed my curiosity. ""Yes, but some might think she's her stepdaughter. You have to look after her like after a little child."", the reply followed.

The snail girl had short purple hair, occasionally covering her eyes, and was wearing a hoodie or one of those Japanese anime jumpsuit pajamas. Also, she would sometimes hide in her shell when afraid or embarrassed, despite of the small size of the shell, which obviously couldn't fit her. Although, I think this is just an animation metaphor.

Following this scene I walked down the street to the sea in bemusement. I met some serious scientifically literate folks there, with whom I was somehow familiar, and told the story about what I have witnessed. They told me about giant snails with extraordinarily high mimicry skills.

Soon I started to gradually awaken and realise that that perfect anime never existed.",1570734928.0

In the dream, she was a good friend of mine.  She had her breasts in one blue and white cardboard box on the coffee table, and the front half of her pelvis in another,  She was doing something in another part of the house, and I snuck a look in the breast box.  They were smallish, probably b cups, with small dark brown puffy nipples.  I licked and nibbled on one, thinking to myself it was funny that I could now say I had sucked on Shakira's titty, even though I knew it didn't count because she wasn't wearing them (and it was perfectly normal in the dream that people had detachable parts).  She yelled from the other room ""Hey, I can feel that!"" and so I stopped and put it back in the box.

She came back in the room and I asked her if I could borrow them for a little while, and she says sure, she's not using them right now, and used some euphemism for being on her period that I had never heard and can't remember now.

I got in my car (I don't have a car) and started driving down the road with the two boxes on the passenger seat, and I was thinking I'd post pictures of them on Reddit so I could prove that I knew Shakira IRL.

PS, I'm 26, Male, 3rd yr physics student, have 2 children age 5 and 2.

I'll get straight to it: (Also posted in a smaller group)

I was walking my 5yr old son to his classroom at school, and they had a new turret gun system installed to combat against school shootings. It would get hidden in the ceiling but you knew where they were as they would make a bug zapper kind of buzzing noise.It was supposed to detect anyone who was about to fire a gun and execute them before anyone got hurt.Before school it would only have rubber bullets because it was considered that even someone with a gun outside of school hours wouldn't be a threat. At the start of the school day it would load with live rounds and they would make an announcement with the bell that it is ""switching to live rounds"".

My son was playing and running around,being a normal happy kid, but I had to ponder what could possibly set the system off. I decided to try and explain to my son what ""live rounds"" were, and that if they went off they would kill him in an instant. I found it too hard to explain and decided to drop it.

The kids were all too young to understand what any of it meant, and were blissfully unaware.As I was walking through the school I would watch kids throw things like stones and I would get really nervous. It felt like there was a gun pointing at my (and everyone else's) head everywhere I went, triggered by a program written by someone who only had hypothetical scenarios they could imagine to guide how it operated.

After a while it freaked me out so I went into my son's class to speak with the teacher, and figure out who to talk about to get rid of the thing. Before meeting the teacher I saw a fat naked lady sitting just inside the door with all the kids seated on the floor for the teacher who was also naked but just going about the day like normal. I gathered it was some planned activity to ""teach the kids to be proud and confident of their bodies no matter what they looked like"".

Despite my desire to question how appropriate this was, I decided not to address it.To not put the teacher on the spot I asked ""hey do you who I can talk to about the **pew pew,** it's really freaking me out.

Teacher: ""Why would it be freaking you out"".

Me: ""Um, you know what, I don't really have a reason but I'm really uncomfortable about it and its freaking me out"".

The teacher says to everyone that I can just go into the staff toilet till I feel better, to imply that was the correct solution if you get irrationally anxious.

I took that as a signal that it wasn't to be questioned, and by me saying anything at all, I've made the kids aware that there is something to be nervous about, which seems to have upset the teacher.

I go to the toilet to sit for a little while, and decide not to waste my time, walk back out and say ""I'm feeling better, thankyou for your suggestion""

I go into the office on the way out of the school and try asking the receptionist about the system and they start defending it heavily like they are already prepared to fight off concerned parents.

I ask if there is any kind of specification on how it works, details, even a standard (I ask for standards a lot in dreams).They said it was impossible to have a standard because its the first of its kind, and its the best there is.

They then say there was a committee that met 18 times over 12months to make sure there were no issues with the system, and it can't go wrong.I wasn't satisfied with that answer as it felt like it was more of a fudge figure and not representative of any actual work done to prevent accidents or false detection.

All I could think about was some innocent naive kid was going to be shot dead, and the grieving family it would leave behind. Then if this were the case, it will just become some ""lessons learned"" document for the developers, and that even this won't get it removed from the school.

Idk, is it possible that maybe it’s the Trauma from past experiences. Like when I get these experiences, it’s so powerful and overwhelming, and I know I’m probably dumb but I’m just confused.

I don't get them as often any more and if I do dream, it's usually a recurring experience (like walking through a hallway but never opening the door).

I was in a strange version of life. A setting that bordered on my current environment and fantasy, like large, open ramparts set on a hilly cliffside overlooking the ocean. A high school acquaintance was playing different scores of Chopin on some strange device that looked like a rollodex of 20 different Edison cylinder records but sounded like a harpsichord. Then a close friend bet me he could swim across the ocean, jumped off the rampart and disappeared. Lots of just strange and random occurrences.

After three or four random events, I was led into a small wooden room that resembled a saloon  to meet a man who looked like The Dude. Everything seemed great. He introduced himself as God, mumbled something under his breath, then stabbed me in the eyes a few times and began throwing things at me. After getting hit four or five times, I realized they were lemons. I was a bit confused. 

Then the dream reset, with me walking into the room to meet God for the first time - serious deja Vu. This time, I expected the stabbing and the lemons. On the second hit, I picked it up and threw it back at him. I saw the beginnings of a smile on his face and then--BAM! I woke up.",1570724266.0

I wrote down what I could remember but there's a few gaps...

It was daytime, in a very big house with lots of people, there were lots of doors in this house leading to big rooms, I was standing in the lobby kind of area, the people all seemed friendly and were largely recognisable, but not accurate of my close friends or family. Suddenly some of the doors burst open and 7 other people come running out into the lobby, they were zombies and myself  and all the people in the lobby knew that, but they didn't look or act like zombies, they didn't attack straight away but I suddenly had a revolver (with 7 bullets in it) and a stubby shotgun with 2 shells. There was a bit of a standoff, the zombies and the normal people taking slow steps toward eachother and stopping for a few seconds, kinda like dogs do. We were then face to face, I started firing and bullseyed every single one, not a single bullet wasted, which is strange because I usually struggle to defend myself in dreams. Whilst I'm firing I'm second guessing myself whether I've just shot normal people, they were acting strange but not like normal zombies...we move to another bigger room and bolt all the doors, there is a large chunk of the dream missing here, but I know something important happened and I'll add it if it comes back, fast forward towards the end of the dream, people are trying to get in the room for safe haven from the zombies, but I don't trust that they aren't zombies themselves, so I don't let them in, I notice their skin colour and they happen to be black, and I thought to myself ""damn, I hope they don't think I didn't let them in cos they're black"". That's all I remember but I'll add if anything comes back. Really wondering if there's much to take from this dream? Please feel free to ask me any questions, I'm very open about my life.

Were all sitting on the ground, my back up against this tree that's brown but has faint almost rainbow undertones. I'm staring at it and for what ever reason I whip out my knife to see what's the later beneath looks like. I'm stopped by a sergeant who says I can ""get fucking fined for fucking with the plants here"" so I put the knife away. Boss man starts talking to us about whatever it is First sergeants think is worth talking about when suddenly from a building behind him. Dogs. So many puppers start pouring out of all kinds. Were all dead silent completely confused but obviously excited, but no one approaches the pups. Soon some of them start to approach us. Doing what dogs do washing tails giving kisses. Everybody hype. But then something weird happens. What pup (idk the breed but the kind that are all brown with medium long shiney fur) starts to talk. He yells out ""Andy! I love you Andy! I love you already Andy!"" All while looking at my buddy whose name definitely isnt Andy. So that's weird but hey dogs. Were all feeling good again until suddenly from the same building. Children? A whole bunch of kids start marching out. Kids of all races and shapes. But before we can even start to figure things out, the nightmare begins. Up until now the kids coming out are all wearing normal clothes. But out of  nowhere this group of children opens up to reveal a whole bundle of kids wearing navy blue shorts and the most hazardous yellow collars shirts (mikado according to google) and these kids are making a B-line right for us. Everyone's paralyzed dude. I manage to speak first but it's nothing meaningful. The words ""what the fuck"" kinda fumble out of my mouth. This was a mistake.

Every ones is covering their ears and cringing but we aren't given much time to recover as the kids are sprinting towards us now. We act accordingly and start running for our lives. I quickly scurry up that tree from before, hoping that the kids will be too short to climb up and for a second it looks like I'm correct. I can see the river of piss yellow children sprinting past my tree. There are just a few at the base looking up at me wonder how they can get up to me. Well theh quickly figure out how. They begin the mount each other. It doesnt take much to reach the lower branches and suddenly their climbing after me up through the branches. And that's it. I'm up.

Context: I had this dream (apparently) on June 12th, 2018. The morning after I had it I wrote it down and emailed it to myself. I found it again while cleaning out my inbox today. I've edited a few typos/grammar mistakes and replaced the names of the people involved with generic descriptors, but other than that, this is what I had originally written, verbatim.

""I am here now to relate to you a most strange dream. It was equal parts disturbing and incredible.

First, it is important to note that you were attending an event. The nature of this event was unspecified. I do know, however, that it was exceedingly large. A far greater scale than any convention you had attended previously. It was not only large, but also distant. The journey took two days. You travelled with your mother and siblings. Your father and perhaps a few of the youngest children were absent. The reason was not explained.

On the second night of your journey, you stayed, of all places, at a gas station. The building possessed two miniature beds which somehow slept six people comfortably. It was understood that your family had access to the building whenever they may need it.

The decor was decidedly adult (possible foreshadowing of events to come). You had half a mind to remove a few of the posters, but as the building was public and not under your jurisdiction, you decided against it.

The event spanned multiple days. You slept with the family at a nearby place. It cannot quite be described as a house or a building. It was too strange for words. I cannot adequately relate the shape and nature of the place. I do remember you had a clear view of your surroundings. Presumably through a window, though it may well have been empty space. Across from your sleepspace, there was a massive, yet unfinished mansion. You will visit this place later.

When not attending the event, you were often using headphones, cell phones, laptops, and television. However the content you had access to was restricted and your father-who appeared without explanation- could remove devices from your possession at any time.

The event took place in a labyrinth of rooms, stairwells, hallways, spaces accessible only by shaky ladders or fragile ropes. It was not particularly crowded besides your core group of acquaintances- though they would soon become much more than that.

Many rooms were large and filled with bookshelves placed seemingly at random, and some shelves filled with snacks and junk food. The lighting throughout the interior of the building was dim, though not dark. You and your friends frolicked. A word which is meant to mean chased each other about, laughing for not particular reason and running, jumping, with no particular end. The people who accompanied you included (at some time or another) , Guy Friend, The Twins, and various students who attended school with you. The fact that both twins were present will soon appear disturbing and unusual. As will the presence of Guy Friend.

As you were debating which activity to participate in next, Cole provided an interesting suggestion to which all present happily agreed. You found his suggestion socially unacceptable but alluring nonetheless. His suggestion was this: why don’t we celebrate our four year anniversary? The others seemed immediately to recall what he was referring to. It seemed you were missing some information, intruding on an inside joke. Anniversary of what? You were obviously involved, but for some reason the others were unsurprised to hear that you had no memory of the event.

Four years was inaccurate, but precise numbers are unimportant in the dreamscape. You distinctly remembered attending the same event last year and frolicking in much the same manner. Perhaps you had become high or drunk, causing you to forget the details. But you’d never been high, nor drunk! Was is possible to become so intoxicated and not remember? You concluded that perhaps it was just routine forgetfulness, or a result of a natural, manic high. Such occurrences were not foreign to you. Even so, it seemed strange, almost impossible, to completely forget an event of such magnitude.

The event in question was illicit sexual behavior between the very individuals now present, with one exception of which you would learn later. Guy Friend created a group chat including the members, titled 4 Year Orgy Anniversary! There were seven participants total. You, Guy Friend, Twin One, Twin Two, Gal Friend, Gal Acquaintance, and one who you did not recall meeting.

Six of you met in a secluded room containing books and snacks. Thin, yellow shafts of light criss-crossed the floor and ceiling-which was very high. Once arrived, you noticed the unfamiliar face.

“Wait, wait,” you said, alarmed that you could forget meeting someone. “Who’s this?”

The girl had medium light hair. She was not much taller than you. The specifics of her build and face escape me, but she was not particularly attractive. Her name was Ionian, or something equally alien.

Eyes wide, you asked each member individually what you had done with her. They each responded with the same word, a single word, “torso”. You assumed they meant you’d engaged somehow with her breasts. Ah. Okay.

The chosen method of celebration was, of course, to repeat the experience. The merrymaking commenced with tender kisses, seemingly at random. Your lips collided with Gal Acquaintence’s. She certainly knew what she was doing. You could feel someone’s hot breath on your neck.

The event had barely started when it was abruptly ended with a rude interruption. A door swung open, letting in a flood of light. Immediately you spun on your heel and marched towards the snacks, instinctively speaking loudly so as to seem unsuspicious. The others stood awkwardly, embarrassed at being walked in on. The intruder was a woman with glasses.You stood on a ladder and began pulling candy bars from a shelf. “KitKats? Do you guys want KitKats?” I tossed the candy to my friends at random. There were only three KitKats.

The woman eventually left. We collectively breathed a sigh of relief. I was praised for acting so casually. The celebration did not recommence.

The following day was filled with introspection and confusion. The fact that each of the other participants had matching memories pointed towards the conclusion that the original event had indeed occurred. But how? And if I was intoxicated somehow, had I been raped? How could I not remember this? I deleted the group chat. I watched television as I pondered with a pout on my lips and eyebrows drawn together.

Conclusion came when I awoke and realized that nothing of the kind had occurred.""

Yeah so.........that's it. I remember feeling really strange about the dream, uncomfortable, concerned about if it meant anything. Like, why would I dream something like that?? I do tend to forget important things that happened to me in real life. And as disturbing as it was it was also really vivid and the scenery & landscapes were pretty, in a weird, trippy way. Honestly it's kind of funny to me looking back but I still feel sort of icky about it.

TL;DR: apparently in June of 2018 I had a weird, vivid dream where I participated in an orgy with random friends/classmates and later forgot about. Then I had inner turmoil about what it could mean.",1570715191.0

This was that kind of theater.

At one point during the show, for some reason, the audience's seats (including mine) were slowly lowered several feet into the dirt ground below. The floor had completely disappeared by this point, and all that was left under us was loose soil, nothing like what you would expect to find in a large city where such a theater might be located.

Also, the seats we were in seemed to have the ability to swing back and forth through the air; they were no longer fixed to the ground, and it's like they were hanging from the ceiling. I could control this, and so I decided to swing back and forth on the seat as far as I could. Even in my dream, I realized this was odd, so I started taking pictures with my camera. I wanted to swing as far as I could and take a picture to remember this bizarre moment.

Unfortunately, I swung too far, and caused the string or whatever holding my seat to break. I also happened to be sharing a seat with another guy (I was on a chair all by myself just a while before, so this is weird). He seemed annoyed at me for causing him to crash to the ground, but didn't appear to be injured. I somehow knew this complete stranger's name to be Andy, and I apologized to him.

Just woke up from a a nightmare. I was working in a hospital and someone was planting bombs in the city. They had found a bunch and defused them and then brought them to our hospital to be examined, but something went wrong and they went off. I had to evacuate patients and families and no one wanted to go. Eventually everyone started moving and I had to get a room full of immobile patients to the elevators and the people visiting them were like, NO help and I had to do it all myself. We had them lined up in beds in the hall cause the elevators could only take a few at a time and the stairs were full of people. One teenage girl was sobbing but most people were pretty calm. We got to the lobby and just as we got there the doors automatically locked. I like, half woke up, to the point where I realized I was dreaming but was still in it and told people to break the lobby windows so they could escape that way while we worked on the doors to get the bed ridden people out.

I’m friends with this guy.. let’s call him Eugene. A few weeks ago on my daily commute to school I saw him on the bus. Which was surprising but I assumed it was nothing because I took a bus later than my usual one. He later told me that he shifted house recently. I didn’t think much of it since we were friends who drifted quite a bit so I didn’t ask anymore questions.

Fast forward to today, I was looking through some of my dream entries I’ve made and I came across one that mentioned: 

Texting Eugene while walking up the escalator at the shopping mall near my school. 
He mentioned that he moved house nearer to the school and only takes a few moments to reach school 

Weird isn’t it? To add on:

The date I wrote was TWO weeks before I met Eugene on the bus and the week before I met Eugene we had a one week school holiday so I couldn’t have met him. That leave us around 4-5 days of meeting before we met on the bus. Which then is also hard to say because like I said earlier, the only reason why I met him was because I took a later bus.

Eugene also used to take around an hour to commute to school but now he only takes 15 minutes at most.

Hulk ended up surprising spider-man with a jet pack and we all got space suits so that we could go out into space. I remember feeling the change in pressure as we broke through the atmosphere and I also felt the weightlessness of outer space. We flew straight for a while following Hulks directions when we accidentally get pulled into the moons gravity and fall onto the surface of the moon.

We knew that our friends were in trouble so we had do find them. Upon searching the building, we heard crying coming from a room in the back. It was a little blonde headed boy looking at a picture of his father sitting at a desk. The room looked like it was set up to be a child’s room. I slowly approached the boy and asked him what was wrong but he wouldn’t talk, he just looked at me and stopped crying and then hugged me.

The sky was an odd almost purple/blue and something started happening that made us go outside. I stood and stared at the sky in awe as all the planets were lining up horizontal in the sky all in my view. I looked over a bit and saw planet earth staring at me. All the planets started to come closer and appeared bigger and bigger until they almost dissolved or exploded. It was almost like a show or something that someone/something was putting on.. after the planets were gone there were large rectangles that reminded me of cards in the sky, and I can’t remember what they were doing exactly but I remember it being a showing of sorts like a tv screen.  After they vanished I woke up. I was in awe and the dream is still making me feel some type of way.

I look at his house and notice that the barn (it was an aluminum barn with a sliding door) was open and the lights were on and the house lights were on too, I made him turn around and drop me off because besides family no one is supposed to be there. I go inside and it’s a grandma and grandson that I kinda recognize. (Maybe from the funeral? I don’t know) she tells me they are just visiting. Everything is moved out of the house but still I go down the hall starting to cry and I go into his room and look around, I go to the window and I look outside and there is my dad (keep in mind he died from cancer so he really didn’t look the best) he had a cut on the upper right of his forehead and he looked kinda sick but not nearly as bad as he was. Blown away I run outside and the first thing he says to me is “I need to find the pistol up in the barn the butcher fucked me up” (to kill himself I guess?) as he starts walking to the barn I follow in hysterics where eventually about halfway up he just stops and turns to me and says “first though” he comes in and tries to hug me but stops himself and says “I can’t touch you it’ll fuck you up” I understood and we kinda chit chatted for a second before he tells me before he died one of his friends is getting me a job as a truck driver. This was all too much for me to really process and I woke myself up and started crying, couple questions I have is who is ‘The Butcher’ and why couldn’t he touch me exactly?

 The driver was a friend that I know in real life.
When we arrived at my bus stop I notice that I forgot my bag in the bus but the bus was just starting to leave. 
So I told myself that I have to catch up the bus to take back my bag. That's when I saw a person in a car who is a robot but had the physical characteristics of a human, in my dream people didn't trusted him but because of the situation I had to get my bag back as soon as possible so I asked the robot if I could get in his car and follow the bus. At first he looked dubious but he finally agreed. It was from that moment that I became Lucid and I realized that I was dreaming.
Insides the robot's car, following the bus. 
Then I remembered this post on r/Dreams where someone said that when he said that he was lucid dreaming, the characters of his dreams, would get angry but if he told them that it was not a problem and that despite all they still ""exist"", they were not going to get angry. 
So I had the idea to tell the robot that I was dreaming and that despite everything it still existed. 
When I tried to told him that he just god angrier and the dream stoped.
He was really angry.

It was daytime in the dream, and everything was very vivid and clear. My dining room and kitchen were exactly the same as in my waking world, which doesn't usually happen. I knew I was dreaming and I wanted to see where this would go.

I opened my back door and standing at my steel security door is a little boy. He was maybe eight or ten years old, not quite four feet tall. Blonde, blue eyes, the picture of innocence.

""Hi. I'm your new neighbor, my family moved in next door.""

""Is that so? I did not see you move in.""

""We moved in over night.""

""Oh, I see. Welcome to the neighborhood.""

The child's eyes lock to mine and, unblinking, he asks, ""will you let me in?""

""Why should I let you in?""

""You should let me in.""

Me, amused, ""why?""

""Because my mom needs to borrow something from your kitchen.""

""Why didn't she come to ask herself?""

""She sent me.""

""I can see that. What does your mom need?""

""You should let me in and I can get it.""

""Get what?""

""Let me in.""

""No.""

A black, viscous, oily substance started oozing down from the child's hairline. He reached up and tried the door knob. Locked.

""Let. Me. In.""

Black cracks began to form in his once-perfect face.

""Why do you want in so badly?""

His hair became dirty and his clothes tattered and covered in filth.

""Let me in.""

He continued struggling against the locked knob.

""I'm not letting you in.""

His eyes turned solid black and his skin a pale-gray.

""Let me in!"" the not-child finally shouted.

I calmly reached into the neck of my shirt and pulled out my Benedictine medal. The not-child flinched at the sight of it.

""I will not let you in. I know you are not from here; you lie. You are not welcome here.""

He stiffened and seemed to involuntarily take a step back.

""Leave this place, now.""

He snarled, then turned and walked away. At that point, I woke up.

With me, a friend I don’t know irl named Sam, and Sam’s little brother. I had a good idea for a prank so I told Sam and he let me do it. I told Sams little bro that I’d pay him 50 cents if he doused himself in gasoline. He did and I gave him the money. Sam came out of the gas station store with a box of matches. I had the good idea to tell him I’d pay him 10 dollars if he’d drink the gas. He took the gas hose thingie, held it up to his mouth, and chugged it for a solid 5 seconds. Then I was like “hey catch” and I threw a lit match at him. He immediately erupted into flames. There was also a water hose thingie next to the gas for no reason but he picks up the gas one instead and he burns even more. All while Sam and I are laughing our butts off. The end result was a big pile of charcoal. Then a couple of adults asked if we charcoaled him throughout the rest of the dream and we said no and they believed us.

376,A Breakdown In The Countryside,1,dfry4s,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/dfry4s/a_breakdown_in_the_countryside/,0,"I dreamt that I was crying during a mental breakdown while walking along a lonely road in the countryside. I briefly looked up and took notice of a farm even though there were no animals, just crops.  


I saw the farmhouse and collapsed on the porch. I then heard a man's voice shouting ""Who's there?""  


I looked up and saw my late father looking out the window at me. He shouted ""Son, are you alright?!""  


""Dad?""  


""Yes son, it's me. It's your father.""  


He then opened the door and took me by the hands in order to help me stand up.  


""Son, you look awful. What happened? Where's your mom and your sister?""  


""Dad, they are coming but they want to stay. They just want to get away from the city for awhile.""  


""Son, just come in."" I obliged.  


We entered the living room where he gestured at me to sit by the fireplace given the rainy weather.  
""Son, do you want something to drink?"" he asked me.  


""What do you have, Dad?""  
""Tell me what you want and I'll get it for you.""  
""Um...Diet Coke?""  
""I do got some Diet Coke, but before I get it for you, be forewarned there is someone else in this house you should not talk to at all. If he appears, don't say anything to him.""  


""Who?"" I asked.

&#x200B;

""You'll see."" he said back to me.  


I then heard a noise coming from the backyard and looked out a window. I saw another man with his back to me tending to the crops with a physique similar to my father's.  
""Dad?! Who's he?!"" I shouted.  


The other man turned and looked right at me. He looked exactly like my father.  
""Dad?"" I asked. ""Why does that man look exactly like you?""  
""Son, let me show you something."" He then removed a book from a bookshelf and showed me a page.  
""Son, after I went, I knew I had to keep watch over you and the rest of the family for as long as possible. In fact, I'm still doing it right now and will for as long as I will be able to.""  
""But what about your twin out there?"" I asked.  


My father walked to the backyard and got into an argument with his other self. He said to his other self, ""Help me with the boy. Can't you see he's upset and crying?! He needs someone to comfort him. You know I can't do this by myself.""  
What shocked me next was what my father's other self said, ""Fella, the boy is showing emotion. He still isn't a real man. Real men can't show emotion because it's a sign of weakness. Now if you excuse me, let me try to shove a smoke into the boy's mouth to see if he can get a high.""  


""Don't you dare!"" shouted my real father. ""Son, get back into the house right now!"" I obliged.  


The dream ended with my mom and my sister showing up and being allowed to stay. However, my father's other self continued to be a threat.  


Then I woke up.  


Some ideas I had after I had this dream happened was that males can be one of two types:  
\-Understanding, caring, someone who rejects gender stereotypes, and believes being emotional is okay.  
\-Refusing to understand others, overtly arrogant, overtly masculine, and someone who believes that if a male shows emotion it is a sign of weakness.  


Had my father managed to get through his treatments without any problems, he would have turned   
60 back on May 6th.

College was taking a hold of my mental health along with working too many jobs, it was not a good time, and I would start to worry about my health, my life and other worrying thoughts.  Anyways that’s just context, I’ll get to the dream-

I was in an apocalyptic world, it didn’t look apocalyptic but I knew it was.  Maybe it was the lack of people, or that I was in an industrial area.  everything was so crisp, I was following train tracks, and stopped at a house to rest with my group.  It was a hazy, but nice 80’s themed room, with green accents.  Eventually we moved on for our job., now determined. The job was to hunt the beast, that was plaguing the area.  I was anxious and in fear, yet nothing around me should have scared me.  It was all empty, like it was just us in the entire world. We wound corners, ducked under boarded up doors, and searched.  I turned the corner and saw the beast.  Ripples of the void emanated across its body.  It looked like a scaled up buffalo/bear/monster.   It saw us, and we were terrified.  The beast charged, yet something changed, as if someone had a hand on my shoulder.  I felt tears and energy in my eyes, I confronted the beast.  I held gun up but did not shoot.  The strangest thing was that I was terrified up until this point, but as I stared at it, I felt powerful, strong, safe, and the beast to me felt sad, foiled, and leaching; as if the leach got torn off and now its ability to consume was no more.  The beast began to crumble and melt down into this small slimy dog creature, it than ran off under a door.  

At that moment, I felt light, and the world began to fade.  I was then in the middle of space.  Celestial bodies hovered, and a star like our sun gleamed across the cosmo.  I flew around for a bit but then I saw it.  It was a huge void of the same substance the beast was made out of, writhing around - like a nest, absolutely massive.  I felt small, so small.  The beast was nothing to this.  I was not afraid, the sea of fear larger than I could imagine, but I was not afraid, but more...... concerned.

I awoke and felt light.  The smell of fall vibrates my body today and it reminded me of the dream.  I have not had anxiety attacks like before the dream since.  I still have vidid dreams, I’ve always had- but nothing quite like this one.  I’m very thankful I had that dream.",1570691800.0

I remember hearing loud noises from time to time and seeing figures just like in sleep paralysis, except I was fully awake and able to move. 

And the dreams, oh boy. They were so bizarre it's hard to explain, dare I say they were more vivid than lucid dreams.

Second Dream is this girl who is trying to kill me.",1,dfpocm,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/dfpocm/had_two_dreams_this_night_and_this_morning_first/,0,"So I had two dreams and I don't know if they're connected. I'll talk about the first dream first. 

This started off in a building where our review classes were held. (In real life, I'm attending a review classes to prepare for my board exams). So in our class, there are, as usual, a group of friends. In my case, I'm in a group that compose of us three boys. 

There is this one girl though who are staring at us most often and we always see her every time wherever we are, like a stalker. At one time, this girl need help. Two of my friends decided not to, because they said they were busy. So, she asked me instead, and of course, I did help her. So, she asked me to follow her. I followed her and end up what appeared to be a guardhouse. We rest there for a while and talked. I told her that I was sorry because most of the times I want to help her, but decided not to, because I'm probably waiting to be asked. I don't recall what she said afterwards. After we talked, the guardhouse moved like its bringing us to somewhere.

After that is the second dream. 

The started off with me trying to teach this girl in this recently abandoned and bloody building. It's like a police station. After I finished teaching her, she told me thanks, and then she asked me if I know why she brought me here. I said no, then she told me, ""to kill you"". I got shivers and surprised, so I said, ""what?"" She then asked me if I know what happened in the place where we are. I shook my head. She then proceeds to tell the story of what happened in this place. 

I also dreamed in her point of view, on how she bloodied the place. It starts off with her in a room with a police officer interrogating her, and then, both hear the people panicking outside. There are zombies coming inside the station. She opened the door so that zombies can get inside her room. Two zombies came inside, one going for the officer and one going for the girl. The girl used the bars of the door as a cover so that she won't get bit but the officer uses his pistol to shoot the two zombies. The girl said thanks and said that they are not the only zombies. Because of that sound, more zombies are coming inside the room. The girl used the door again as a cover but the officer keeps shooting, until he's eaten. The girl used this as an opportunity to run away.

Now, back to my own point of view. When she's finished talking, she opened the vent and run away to the exit and locked the doors. I tried to open the doors as I was locked inside and told me that if I want to stay alive, I have to stay on the vents. Zombies see me, so I need to go to the events before I am eaten. Luckily, I am just in time. 

The next day, I'm still alive and she went back and asked for my help. I did help her but I made a mistake and told me that, ""You have no friends, you stink. You should die."" She ran away to the exit again. I was locked again but this time I managed to break and escaped. She just ran away farther, I didn't bother to chase her because I was wandering anywhere just to get home. Fortunately, my teacher back in high school and the girl I know from the review class, let's name her Pauline, sees me along the highway. (This girl is different from the first dream, and I know this girl in real life, so is the teacher.) They asked what happened and I explained. Pauline seems to be going to the review class, and I asked her if it's okay for me to come along. She said yes. 

I think that's it. I don't really recall how it ends and there are some stuff that I could still remember, like seeing my classmates from college, but do not know when exactly happened.",1570694101.0
387,Had a weird dream that there was a fire at my practicum school,5,dfisik,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/dfisik/had_a_weird_dream_that_there_was_a_fire_at_my/,1,"So, for context, I am a university student in my last year and I am studying to be a high school Spanish teacher. I go to a practicum school to practice teaching and my host teacher (who is amazing and I look up to her very much) is also our instructor for our practicum course. 

In this dream, I was at my host school and it was the first class of the day. All the students in this class are freshmen and my host teacher decided to have my teach that lesson for the class hour. I was at the front of the class going over some Spanish sentences when the fire alarms went off. Some students casually left and I looked at my host teacher for some indicators as to what we were about to do. She smiled as she normally does and said, ""It's okay, just keep teaching."" So I followed her instructions and kept teaching as she did some work at her desk, still smiling and observing how I was teaching. This teacher is like the kindest woman I know, so it wasn't rare for her to smile because she is almost always smiling. Though I thought it was odd that she was smiling as the fire was taking some of the desks, so the remaining students just moved to other desks that were not being burned. A few more students laughed and my host teacher just smiled and said goodbye. Then, the announcements came on and the principal said that the fire was a little more serious than we thought and that at this point we should all be leaving. The remaining students left the classroom until it was just me, my host teacher, and now suddenly a little baby that was hers. She was about to leave so I grabbed my host teacher's baby and she said ""Oh thanks!"" As if I were grabbing her purse or something that she left behind.

It was such a weird and comical dream. It isn't that odd for me to dream about being in a Spanish class because I have had dreams about being in Spanish class since I was in high school. This dream, however, was weird because of all the crazy things that happened. My host teacher does not have any children yet, though she asked me last week if I wanted kids then we talked about how she wants kids, but she still isn't sure yet because she is afraid.

Could anyone give me some insight as to what in the heck this dream means? I can't stop laughing over the fact that she almost left her baby in the burning classroom then thanked me very casually about picking him up. That is most definitely not something she would ever do lol",1570664360.0

In my dream, my 11 year old dachshund who we put down 2 years ago appeared. I was sitting on a bench and suddenly felt a little dog zoom over to me. I swore I could feel his soft coat and gentle nose boops and I looked down and told him “thanks for coming to see me, I’ve missed you so much” and felt his happy tail slapping my leg as I pet him. I was euphoric. I swore I felt his presence!  I sat at that bench petting him and feeling so carefree, then I just watched him happily trot away into nothing.

My dreams are worse when I wake up then fall back asleep. Sometimes it torturous. Literally watching my boyfriend choose and fuck someone else right after I was being chased by some huge (usually male) figure trying to either rape me or beat me up or kill me.

Hope you guys are having a wonderful week. I know I am. 

So I've been flying in my dreams for a while now (maybe 3 years). It's so much fucking fun. Like straight zooming around the place. Last night I was flying around a rollercoaster theme park. The sky was so blue. I was in 3rd person mode. I was able to go so high it was ridiculous....  I FELT ALL THE FEELINGS. It was beyond real. Extremely lucid. This went on for a while and I didn't want it to end. I knew it was dangerous but I couldn't help myself I felt invinsble .

At some point it became scary, I was going too fast and I went too high and crashed (into some sort of structure). I numbed out and time slowed down. I could hear parents crying... 

Suddenly I'm in 1st person mode. The feeling of ' O fuck' came over me ... I'm in a vacant / eerie building.....  Hovering .. .. I look down .. I'm not in my body ... I'm in a misshapen globe of pixelated flesh.... I have a feeling that ""this is the interlude , this is where I wait until I am 100%""   .. A black and grey punch bag style  mannequin is next to me.

I sad to myself. I'm not ready to die. I fee like I'm just getting started. My life has been going very well the past 3 months, I've found interests that are changing me as a person and bettering people around me.

It didn’t look like the sun anymore. It looked more like a ball of fire instead of glowing (Trying to describe everything well since my dream was so detailed) All of a sudden the ground shook really hard. Just imagine thunder coming from the ground instead of the sky. That’s how it felt. The sun wasn’t in the sky anymore. it kept getting lower and lower towards the ground. When the sun almost made a reaching point to the ground me and my family got in a circle and told each other we loved each other.  It’s like in my dream EVERYONE knew what was going on without anyone speaking on what was happening. Nobody could be scared because we knew the day would come. It’s like everyone was prepared for it in a way. The ground shook one last time and you could hear horns very LOUDLY. I can’t describe where the horns came from. It’s like the sound came from out of the sky. The horns were intense also, everyone had to hold their ears.

In this dream I was about the same age I actually am (18), and I was pregnant (in real life I’m not). I decided to place my baby for adoption. I met the potential adoptive mother and she seemed great. She was in her late 40s, had already raised three kids, who were close to my age, and lived in a peaceful, semi-rural, middle-class town. I decided she could adopt my baby. She said she was ok with open adoption (bio mom can maintain contact with child) or closed adoption (bio mom does not contact child), and I could choose which option I’d prefer. 

Then, after an unknown period of time passed, I gave birth to a boy. He was a little bit premature and had to stay in the hospital for a few extra days. I stayed with him, and his adoptive family visited him too. During this time, I got to know my baby’s future siblings: a high school aged girl, an 18-year-old girl, and a twenty-something guy. They were horrible people. I don’t remember exactly what they said or did, but they were awful. And I started to question whether or not I actually wanted my baby to be raised by the same lady who raised these three. As the days went by, this family started seeming sketchier and sketchier to me. At one point, I just needed a break from being in the hospital with my baby. Some of my friends invited me to hang out, so I left for a few hours to hang out with them and get my mind off things.

I had only told a couple of my closest friends about the pregnancy, and I hadn’t seen the rest of my friends in several months. They were all like, “long time no see! What have you been up to?” And I was like, “I gave birth!” And they were like, “WHAT?!” and I told them the whole story. And then I broke down crying. And I realized that I didn’t want an open adoption. Or a closed adoption. Or any adoption at all. Even though I was only 18, and single, I needed to raise my son. I couldn’t leave him with those weird near-strangers. So I ran back to the hospital to find out if it wasn’t too late to change my mind. And then I woke up.",1570658078.0

So in this dream S.O. and I and his mom live in a large complex, there's a pool and bridges and superior landscaping. 

I am into roller derby, and there was a girl in my roller derby team that I had confided a lot to about my relationship with my S.O.
(Recently rediscovered my love of skating and have made a friend I've confided in) 

I walked into the garage one morning and there was a blow up doll laying across an open box full of other stuff I couldn't make out in the dream. S.O's mom is packing this stuff up. I ask her ""what's this?"" And she says it's S.O's and that there's another one he has already put away. 

I see a scene where he is storing things in this storage shed that only he has a key to. (Is he hiding things from me?)

Then his mom asks me if I saw the lubes that got sent to us (a possibility to ease friction, but rejected) 

I say no, And she says he probably put that in his storage too

Later I am near the pool and his sister says ""did you know our mom cut off her clitoris to keep him from playing with it?"" I say no,  are you kidding?
She said ""yeah, she got tired of it so she did that""

Then I'm walking with my cat and I'm far away from the main house, I have to go to the bathroom. I jump into this trailer with my cat and tell my cat that I'm gonna pee in this little box. The box was about 4x4x2 bronze and trimmed in gold, very ornate (Self expression is confined,  cat is my friend)

Then the trailer starts moving, and I don't pee in the little box, I look out over the edge and a guy has picked up this long hitch to the trailer and is literally carting  us back to the main house, I'm ok with this because I gotta go to the bathroom. (Inability to Express, not where I need to be) 

It ends with me putting makeup on a guy that looks like Russell brand, he's sitting on a trail and drawing something on paper.  I put one shade for him on his upper cheek and one shade for me on his lower cheek 
He looks at it and says he doesn't really like the shade on his upper cheek. I say ok and wake up",1570670235.0

I was on a tour bus with a band. Things were fun watching movies and shows with my friends on the go. But something went wrong. Zombies started attacking. We used our bus as a mobile base. While fighting off zombies I got caught in an explosion. For a while I was dazed and couldn’t remember who I was. I also had superpowers. I could fly, I had super strength and durability. Zombies were no longer a threat.

(This is where things get interesting.)

As the memories came flooding back to me and I remembered who I was, I made a bold decision. I felt insecure about who I was before. So, I lied to everyone that I still did not remember who I was. I acted like a new person. We moved our base from a tour bus to a university campus, where we built a large community of survivors, whom I protected. The people loved me like a celebrity and loved when I showed off my powers.

My close friends, however, were worried about my memories. They kept prodding my memory. They asked about what I know and what I don’t know. I made mistakes in this. I focused to much on trying to answer incorrectly about questions only the real me would know. I was not thinking about my new personality. I made contradictions. I told someone I didn’t want to kill animals, but I killed a wild bull shortly later. My close friends figured it out. They were angry at me. They refused to talk to me. The survivors still loved me, but my friends felt distant.

Zombies still attacked the University and I still killed them. I no longer felt a thrill from fighting like I used to. The cheers and celebration from the survivors no longer excited me. I just wanted to talk to my friends again.

(There was a long story about a super villain in a lab here, but it seemed unrelated so I will put it in the comments if you wish to read it)

A new survivor at our base was a psychic and could answer any one question. I could only be one question, but because I saved her, she offered me two. But I only wanted to ask one. “How can I get my friends back.” Instead of answering directly she told me to rest on a near by bed. She left, and after a short while she came back with my friends. I admitted to them that I lied, and I was sorry. I told them I didn’t like who I was, and I saw an opportunity to be someone new. Someone special. Someone people would respect.

400,A perplexing dream sequence,0,dfigtc,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/dfigtc/a_perplexing_dream_sequence/,4,"It started as a trip to a French town by myself, and I'm pretty sure I was a dreaming that I was a child. It was midnight and late winter, the snow was melting and forming these black streams on the pavement, reflecting the light from the lamps above. It felt warm and comfortable, like walking around during winter with your jacket open. Periodically, I felt this chill wind, not particularly unpleasant. 

I was walking around alone until I found a seemingly empty gas station. I walked up to the lawn in front of it, and sat down at a game of legos. I looked at it and felt the need to rebuild the lego building, which in my mind was imperfect. Rather than taking the pieces apart gradually and carefully, I just broke it apart, also damaging and bending some of the larger pieces. 

While I was concentrating on the building, a child who I was certain I never met, began telling his friend about me. I remembered the story as it was being told. He said that a long time ago, another friend and myself took a joke too far. The image came up of me blocking the passage way to a small wooden stall, where there was this little girl inside. I was waving around a gun at her, yelling something. She had a face of confusion rather than terror. By accident (or intentionally, I don't know), I pulled the trigger and killed her. I don't remember the moment of impact, and there was no blood either. 

Now I started to remember the story he was telling a little better. Although everything was dark and distorted I managed to recollect what I did. To cover up the crime I had to burn her. The friend I was with seemed to have no influence on my actions. I burned the wooden stall to ashes - everything became covered in this black material that resembled molasses, but animate. Rather than produce flames it was like she was being consumed by the blackness. 

These images flashed in my eyes and I woke up soon after.

The guy goes into the bathroom for about five minutes. The bartender then looked at me and quietly said to get the hell out, and I realized what might’ve been happening. 
Apparently there was another guy on the stairs who was in the middle of loading what could’ve only been a suppressed SMG, and for some reason I had to go down a set of stairs to escape him.
I sprint down the stairs and jump to the bottom instead of going down the last three, and I just booked it into a mall, and sprinted into a stores bathroom to call the police.
The police came, and apparently some guy with an open carry permit killed the two shooters, but the bar and surrounding area was massacred, and I would’ve died had I not been told to run.

Edit: TL:DR I had a dream about escaping what would’ve been a shooting that killed me, called 911 and some guy with an open carry permit killed the shooters after they destroyed that bar, where I was sitting

405,Weird Prophetic Portal Dream,1,dfhoak,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/dfhoak/weird_prophetic_portal_dream/,2,"I had a really fascinating dream last night involving some sort of ancient portal and some incredible real-world timing (more on that near the end!).

I can't remember how it began, but it involved me toting around with a small group of people (select family members & personalities) in some massive recreational complex. Sometime early in the dream, we learned that there was an ancient mysterious portal/corridor shaped like a massive old-school oxygen tank left on an abandoned balcony isolated within the complex. The portal was closed but there were reportedly some magical occurrences surrounding it. Legend told that it could be opened for the individual(s) that activate it by visiting it at specific times throughout the day, those times needing to be deciphered via riddles that the portal (or some guy overseeing the portal, I can't remember) revealed upon each individual visit. After visiting the portal at the right hour five different times, the portal would magically open for your eyes only, allowing you to see what's on the other side.

Early on in the dream I split from the group to hang out with some random Mclovin from *Superbad*-looking kid for some reason and watched from afar as they went through several trials and tribulations before eventually being granted access to see what's inside the portal. They peeked inside as a brief flash of light emitted from the corridor before emerging from the portal and explaining that they were shown some kind of vision and nothing more.

Eager to learn the details myself, I began following the riddles and arriving at the portal at the specified times, each visit a bit vague in memory but filled with odd magical happenings. Finally, I arrived at the 4th/5th riddle, and the riddle went somewhat like this (yes, it was ridiculously simple in retrospect, it was a dream after all):

""Visit the portal shortly after the base ball game ends, at 8:30 PM.""

So out of nowhere, practically straight out of the movie *Field of Dreams*, an old-school early 20th century game of baseball with the players and all (in the style of old black & brown photographs from the era, may I add) commenced inside the complex next to the balcony, I watched the game from nearby, the game ended shortly thereafter, I visited the portal for the final time and something amazing happens.

I look into it, the whole portal turns bright, and... in real life my S8 phone starts playing the ""Skyscraper"" alarm tone nearby (which fit the tone of the moment absolutely perfectly may I add) and I wake up to the sound of the alarm at the exact time I had set it for before falling asleep.

So, as the ultimate twist, the portal somehow canonically leads to me waking up in real life! (Which sounds like a pretty great concept for an actual book or movie if you think about it!) I mean, it makes sense since the only thing the other people in the dream could see is a ""vision"" while I actually got to go through the portal and essentially ""control"" the vision as if I was the ""chosen one"" or something. More or less resembling the entire plot of *Being John Malkovich*, basically.

Nonetheless it was a very odd yet interesting dream, definitely one of the cooler ones I've had in awhile. I hope my description of the dream made for some good entertainment, at least! Thanks for reading!",1570659478.0

Even when I’m “outdoors” I get the feeling that I’m in my own personal Truman Show, and everyone else is too. I could be lumping these things together because they all feel very nostalgic, even the places I’ve discovered, but for whatever reason I always wake up feeling like I went back to a familiar place. 

Last night I found a massive white plaza I haven’t seen before and took a spherical elevator that goes outside of the building and onto the roof.

I was walking and saw in corner of my eyesight a 2 demons. I knew that if I will look at one of them, he will attack. The second demon was actually weird, he did not attack me, he was just standing and observing, he disappeared after 5 seconds after I saw him. So, I don't know why, but I turned around, look deep in demon's face, not eyes because he didn't have them, walk slowly towards him and start laughing, I was deeply looking at his face and laughing. Then the nightmare ended and I woke up in little panic. Worth to add that I got that nightmare before, in different place than today. What does that mean?",1570658219.0
409,Mysterious Dream I was Chased by a Rabid Bear and a Viking Hillbilly,1,dfhbe2,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/dfhbe2/mysterious_dream_i_was_chased_by_a_rabid_bear_and/,0,"I recently had a dream that I was playing Skyrim (in what looked like my future apartment, I don’t have my own apartment yet) and my girlfriend was watching. My character was running through the cold northern swamps when a super powerful vampire came out of nowhere and started shooting thunderbolts at me. My health was going down quickly so I took some powerful healing potions. When I exited the inventory menu the vampire kept shooting lightning bolts at me. My character ran out of health and was brilliantly resurrected because I had a special item in my inventory. I immediately turned my character into a vampire lord and used a massive drain life spell on the vampire and several other enemies that ran up shortly after I transformed.

 I had almost defeated all of them when a huge rabid bear that looked like it weighed at least 400 kg (900 lbs) ran up out of nowhere and hit me in the back. This bear had patches of hair missing, spots of hair that looked bleached and his eyes were glazed over. He did not give a fuck. He was crazy. After being hit by this massive rabid bear it took a huge chunk of my health away. It was at this point where I felt like my consciousness was now in that situation. It was real now.

I realized this bear was too strong to fight so I ran/hovered away as fast as I could. As I ran through the swamp away from this crazy bear I climbed over several very thick seemingly impenetrable bushes and thickets. Finally and strangely I came across a 100% modern two lane paved road that seemingly came from the swamp. I ran up it and when I thought I lost him my vampire form faded away and instead of my Skyrim character being there I appeared. I kept running, and saw the bear behind me again. I also saw a sports store/restaurant up the road. I ran towards it and I saw people there and a Maltese dog come running out past me and towards the bear. I was concerned for this little dog. But when he got to the bear it completely lost interest in chasing me and instead looked down at the tiny dog that stood close to it. It was as if they instantly became friends. The bear and the little dog investigated each other for a bit and subsequently just walked down the road in the opposite direction of me. I was very relieved to say the least.

I headed towards the sports store/ restaurant and as I got closer only a few meters away a huge man came out he looked to be nearly 210 centimeters (almost 7 feet) tall. He looked like a viking/hillbilly with red hair, a long beard and crazy looking eyes. He was easily 120 kg (260 lbs). He was wearing a baseball cap a red flannel shirt, blue overalls and dirty black boots. He angrily swung open the door and looked directly at me as if I had wronged him. I had a bad feeling about him so I ran. It was now sunset. As I ran into the parking lot behind the store I realized that the parking lot was surrounded by a 4 meter (12 feet) tall fence. I screamed out of frustration realizing I was trapped. Meanwhile as the man came closer he loudly said, “Why are you running Thomas? Why are you running away from the pain?” As he began talking I realized that this was an inherently good man, terrifying in demeanor but compassionate and kind hearted. He had no ill-will towards me. He laughed and said, “It’s a trap Thomas!” He stopped about 3 meters (10 feet) from me and raised his arms as if to worship something and loudly said. “Heaven is a trap!” This is all I remember.",1570657798.0

Dream #1: I was riding a moped and got hit by a semi truck. I remember knowing that i was about to take my last breath and accepting my death and then I woke up right before I died. 

Dream #2: Some drug dealers pulled up to my house and threatened me. I had a shotgun and I shot the main guy in the face. It messed up his face but he kept coming. I shot him I think 2 or 3 more times and he died. The end. 

Dream #3: I was sleeping on my couch downstairs in my dream and I woke up because I heard someone at the door.  They broke in and I was just standing there. It was a police officer ( I have no problem with the police and they aren’t a bad or scary thing in my mind) and he was crawling on all four trying to kill me. I was trying to run upstairs but it was really hard. I also was screaming but no sound came out. I eventually was able to say help over and over in a normal speaking voice.

Not only the same concept but the DEA are the same people in each, and the dreams are continuations of each other. 

So in the dream, my dad works for the DEA as one of the people who actually goes in and busts drug houses and breaks down doors and the raids and the whole shebang. Well I decide to go out with friends or whatever, and first dream a while ago, the DEA was introduced during a dinner setting, then a couple different dreams a few weeks back, we went to a club. The dream last night we went to a party at a house, but there was a line to get into the party area after you enter the house. So my friend and I were waiting in line and I saw one of my dad’s DEA buddies inside the party, looking super out of place in strip club style wear. (It was a rave.) I grabbed my friend and whispered that we had to go. 

We get outside and I realize the car was parked several blocks away so my friend and I start making a run for it. After a few minutes of running, just as we make it to the car, there’s a huge explosion as the party house blows into smithereens. We are thrown to the ground, even though we are blocks away, with ringing ears and then as I’m standing up and getting my bearings after the explosion, I wake up. 

Every one of these dreams are the same premise, we go out, I see the DEA starting to do their thing, and then the place blows up. It’s a very panicky dream, and I’m not really enjoying it, but they are interesting I guess lol.",1570655035.0
416,Invisible monster,2,dfefgx,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/dfefgx/invisible_monster/,2,"My ex gf turned the lights off, was at the edge of my bed naked in pitch darkness. I was touching her crotch, then realized it wasn't actually her. I was actually just using my fingers to rub against the inside of my comforter under the covers near my crotch (where my hands were irl upon awakening). Whatever that monster was, was somehow alerted that I was no longer feeling and see her anymore. I wasn't duped. Tried to get up and this invisible monster/force yelled in my face like a monster movie or Scooby Doo, I could feel its breathe on my face like a strong wind. At this point it tried to hold my arms and legs down and I was wrestling with it and could tell it was hovering over me. 

Then I started seeing weird things like a url bar to type in a website, I guess that it was trying to brainwash me or get me under control. I typed in Google somehow in this search bar I could see visibly. Erasing whatever it was trying to type. I also saw numbers spiraling in circles, kind of like green 0s and 1s in the matrix. I honestly felt like I was being brainwashed due to my waking up and realizing the monster wasn't her. End of Dream.   


When I woke up irl, I was laying on my back, with the same fingers grasping my comforter near my crotch in the pitch darkness. I was scared that something might still be there so I just breathed in a constant rhythm until I had the courage to put the light on, scared that something invisble would try to hold me down.  

I am pretty sure I slept on my stomach, which I almost do, 99% of the time, but I woke up on my back, hands on top of each other with my feet out. 

*Optional background*

How it started, we were on my bed, about a few feet apart laying down, looking in each others eyes, then we started kissing. While kissing, sucking each others lips and faces very hard mind you, one of my teeth cut the inside of her lip by her lower teeth. She said twice that I injured her and made a big deal out this, who ever that was. So I looked at it and it looked like there was meat coming out of her bite. So we went to my bathroom in another part of the house, she was naked somehow and said it's fine we'll just run in there fast and no one will see us. So we get in there and there's this shirt she gave me that I wore on our Anniversary a few years back that was in there lying on a counter that she threw at me, kind of like put this on. Even though I was clothed, she wasn't. So we are trying to I guess fix the bite. I end up naked and she wants to go back into my room. We get there and she shuts the light off, which is weird because we very rarely keeps the lights off. It's pitch black and I can't see anything. But I feel her with my foot (which were hanging out of my blanket irl mind you) and she gets near me, I start using my hand down there until I start realizing that it's not her. That is where it got very scary and is where I started this thread at.  

Dream interpretation?

*TLDR* A monster masqueraded as my gf, got me into a pitch black room. Was fooling around, I realized it wasn't her and it yelled in my face and started holding my arms and chest down very violently by the wrist, and It was like arm wrestling as it couldn't pin me down all the way",1570640767.0

They were processing my order or something, I think for a fursuit. Their motto was something like ""for the furries."" Me and my dad in and there and it was like a blue light in there. There were all these tails on the wall. I remember thinking/saying that I would go there to see some things once it was the time for my fursuit or whatever. I went into another area which had a much more conventional light. I walked out and thought of getting a Persona 3 Protagonist costume instead (which I actually wanted). There were other costume stuff outside the area on the wall. I didn't see a Gekkokaun uniform but I imagined it was there. I saw a light blue anime hair wig and a bunch of other wigs, then I saw a P3 MC wig, with a chibi version of the protagonist on the box. Then I woke up. I am kind of a furry IRL so this makes sense.

He had a bomb vest so I snuck up on him and tried to put him in a choke hold but he flung me off and pointed a gun at me.

So, reacting to this I bolted out of the room and has to push past a load of random people in my house who I didn't know to get away, whereas he just shot them to clear a path 

Knowing that he was serious, I jumped out of the window and sprinted down the road to get away. My thought process was that I needed to find a busy crowd to mingle and escape- and what better busy crowd than Lecister Square? Because I live near a London underground station (in real life too) this was where I ran towards, alerting people on the way that there was a madman chasing me. I didn't expect much help but lots of people actually ran with me to block the guy's vision.

My luck ran out though when I got to the platform and the next train was due in ten minutes. I turned around to run back out and find an alternative but the guy was already slowly walking down the stairs. Unrelatedly, Boris Johnson and Sajid Javid also arrived just before this by walking along the tracks- Javid was wearing a wig which I complimented.

When the man began to slowly walk down the stairs everyone was shitting themselves and had clustered up at the back of the platform- even though I knew he only wanted me. Given this, I approached him and acknowledged there was no hope, but asked for a merciful death at least. To my surprise, he pulled out a poem and said to read it in my head, which I did (wish I could remember what it said). Once I finished it, I passed out and reawakened on the platform knowing I had died, except no one could see me. Walking down the road, I spotted my dad who was grieving, so I ran up and hugged him. He couldn't see me nor sense me, so I picked up two wireless earphones (which I could somehow do) and dangled them in front of him, alerting him to the fact that I was there. From here, we slowly began communicating through methods such as flour and chalk, until people actually became able to see and hear me again to the point they didn't realise I was dead.

Them my dad and me joined an Mongolian tribe and it all gets a bit hazy from there, but I do remember having a false awakening where I was disappointed for having lost my sort-of superpower.

I ended up shooting myself in the head a second time, but I was still alive, although I felt the shot.

I woke up eventually from this dream because of my cat.

The second dream, I was with my mother (alive) and she was driving me around. There was a creek that she wanted to cross while we were driving but she wasn't sure if she was able to cross it without her car sinking into the water. She told my dad (alive) about wanting to but she was uncertain, so he decided to drive it instead. Before we drove into the creek, she asked him, ""if I die, will you save us?"" He didn't answer, but at the same time we all assumed he would of. As we drove in, the car started sinking almost immediately and everything was dark blue. I couldn't hold my breath or try to escape, so I ended up dying. I woke up after the dream and was gasping for air.

I made a throwaway account for this because I feel like its a little bit personal.

Last night (early hours of October 8th, 2019), I fell asleep and before waking up, had a dream that an old teacher of mine committed suicide. I am currently in my second year of university, and he was very well-liked by myself and my high school friends who I still talk to, and he is one of my inspirations as a future teacher myself. He was always so happy and positive in the classroom, there is no way your spirits wouldn't be lifted in his room. 

I can't recall how the dream started, but I recall one of my best friends breaking the news to his girlfriend, who said ""No!!"" and started crying. I walked up and asked what was wrong, and she said to me: ""Mr. ___ killed himself."" I got so welled up in emotion and started crying on the spot. I couldn't even say anything, then everything started losing focus, and I woke up. 

I honestly wouldn't be posting this if everything in what I had described wasn't so vivid. I only remember that part of the dream, but I remember every detail of it. My friend was sitting on a table in a room (possibly a classroom), along with his girlfriend on his left side. I walked in from around a corner on their left side. 

This dream has been bothering me since this morning. I was never the type of person to think that dreams mean anything, but now I just can't help but think about this. Is my subconscious trying to tell me something about myself? Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Over the course of the last few months, I’ve been having a sequence recur in my dreams.

My dreams don’t necessarily repeat themselves in their entirety. The one thing that does however, involves my teeth.

It usually goes like this . I start to feel my teeth, normally in the back of my mouth, start to loosen from my gums, and then they begin to rot out of my mouth. Sometimes, I have to pull them out, but it’s never painful.

I know this isn’t a lot to go on, but I was wondering if there is any explanation as to why this happens. I know I may be asking a question no one knows the answer to, but I’m hoping at least writing it down helps.",1570624864.0

440,"My dreams are seriously exercises in world building. They are so elaborate. I've left out the less exciting stuff. Anyway, here's a funny dream I had while partially lucid/aware.",1,dfawfu,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/dfawfu/my_dreams_are_seriously_exercises_in_world/,0,"Fun dream last night:
So the dream was partially lucid(meaning I had awareness it was a dream and could control things--kind of.) I wasn't all-powerful, like I had hoped. I couldn't fly, but after practicing for hours, I discovered I could slowly float (learned this after falling off a roof.) I could move things with my mind, but not in a cool way. Things would just wiggle a bit or hover. Voila! 

I was a little disappointed, but determined. As the sun was setting, I decided to wonder around the city and experiment some more. I stumbled upon some light festival where people were propelling multi-colored brightly lit led-like projectiles and balloons into the night sky, some in the shapes of animals, flowers--anything you can imagine. Cool.
 What if I lit myself up and, I don't know,  float around or something?! Turns out I couldn't do that. I think I lit up one finger... Barely.

So now I'm stewing over my useless abilities when I come across a snack size packet of gummi bears(Haribo, because that's where it's at!) This'll cheer me up, but these 8 gummi bears aren't anywhere near sufficient. There's only one packet. Hm, maybe I can multiply them? It works! Finally, success! The bag almost instantly overflows and I pop a small handful in my mouth, satisfied with my handiwork.

Gitty with my newfound success, I see just how far I can take it. I multiply them endlessly. Within a few minutes I have a pile half my height. This is wonderful.  Can I light them up? Hell yes I can. Each gummi bear pulsates individually with a rythmic glow. As the beautiful mound grows to near my height I do the obvious thing: I jump inside. 

As the millions of glowing gummy bears cushion my fall, I half swim, half eat my way to the center. I'm basically hysterical with happiness. I'm laughing so hard that this is happening (and how awesome it is) it's difficult not to choke on the mouthful of gummi bears, not to mention they occasionally lodge in my ear or nose. As I go deeper into the mound I can't tell which way is up or down. The weight is starting to become pressing and it's getting harder to breathe (no thanks to my mouthful of gummi bears.)
I stop swimming and take a second to just chew. I notice the flavor, texture, everything is waayyy too real. These gummi bears are real. This is REAL! I'm going to suffocate by gummi bears. Death by deliciousness! In this brief moment of panic I almost instantly broke the lucidity and I woke up.

Despite the brief panic, I'm going to chalk that up as a win.",1570618255.0
441,Had a vivid unsettling dream about the moon,9,df106z,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/df106z/had_a_vivid_unsettling_dream_about_the_moon/,1,"The Moon hungers for the Soul of Man

The dream begins as a collage of a picture a day of my hair growing, before stopping suddenly on a picture of a torso with no head or neck, long thin arms coming out of its shoulders, skin drawn across its pale body.  I look down and realize I’m in an ankle deep stream of blood, the only light is a blood soaked moon high above, massive amounts of blood dropping from the moon, bathing the woods below.  Taking tentative steps forward, the strange creature walks beside me, telling me he is my guide, his voice seeming to come from all around me though he has no voice.  Suddenly it stops, the arm pointing to a dark mountain in the distance, tall and foreboding as he proclaims ‘that is the mountain of sin.’  I ask if that is our destination, he replies that it is not our goal on this day.  

  The blood gets deeper until I’m wading in knee deep currents, the dark woods around me offering no comfort and the blood feeling strangely warm, as if it had just left the body which gave it warmth.  We come upon a cabin, the door open and nothing on the inside, no windows and the door having nothing on the inside to allow one to exit.  The thing tells me this is where I shall find judgement, and stepping up out of the blood I enter the cabin, the door closing shut behind me.  I look around, panicking that there is no way out of the cabin and pound away at the where the door was.  I wait for days, weeks, stuck inside with no way out.  I awake one day as I had all the previous, hungry and afraid.  Standing before me was an identical version of myself, though different somehow.  With a long dark dagger clutched in his hand I ask him what he’s doing here.  He tells me ‘I’m here to feed the moon, it hungers for the soul of man.’  He stabs me through the stomach, then again and again in my torso, I fall down to the ground bleeding, my life leaving my body faster than my blood.  

  My eyes shoot open and I look around, everything as it was during the beginning of my imprisonment in the cabin, my doppelgänger gone, the door cracks open, and I slowly get up and push it open, blood flowing in from higher ground than it had previously flowed from.  Striding out I see my guide, hand pointed towards the mountain once more.  ‘That is the mountain of sin’ he utters with no mouth, his voice everywhere.  Is that our destination I ask, and as an answer he begins walking towards it, I follow after in the blood stream, the moon above glowing brighter than it had before.  A deep bass sounds off in the distance, an unsettling wind following the noise.  The mountain looms before me, the blood lapping at my waist, an abyssal darkness with a plain handle looking to be the gateway into the mountain.  I look to my guide who is turned away from me, his finger pointing towards the moon.  ‘The moon needs fed, it hungers for the soul of man.’  Leaving behind my guide I throw open the gates, nothing but a dark plane lying before me.  Taking a few small steps, the gates creak closed, and I’m left in complete darkness.  

  It’s only moments more until a faint red glow permeates the abyss, my blood soaked legs run towards it, though the closer I get the dimmer the light is.  I reach where I think the light was coming from but it’s gone now, total dark surrounding me once more. I close my eyes and get down on my knees, fear spreading throughout my body.  Opening my eyes everything is covered in an all encompassing swath of red light.  Turning my head around I can see the thing which casts its glow upon the abyss.  A tall, lean man whose body is bare of all distinguishable features stands before me, pale gray skin somehow exudes the red light.  His face has nothing on it, the nose has no nostrils, skin drawn over where eyes should be, with no mouth.  ‘Man deserves not the souls it is gifted, good thing then, that I am hungry.’  His red light gets only brighter and he takes long strides towards me as I back away.  ‘The mountain of Sin stands as a monument to mankind’s evil, and I it’s keeper.’  I’m back outside suddenly, the woods around me cold and the blood seeping up my legs warm.  The red shining down from the moon hurts my eyes.  My guide falls down into the blood, disappearing in its stream, which grows stronger and stronger, taking me into its currents and choking me.",1570574996.0

In my dream, I was able to fly, I feel lonely and I’m standing outside this field with a HUGE tree and a house, and this kid comes and tells me that our dad has named him (this part is odd because I don’t come from a wealthy family or a brother) the heir to a family fortune. This makes me mad, but not because im losing the money, but because I'm technically the oldest and should be the heir. So I tell the kid that I want to challenge them to some kind of duel like a flying duel, and whoever is able to fly to the top of the tree and back the fastest is the winner and gets the unofficial title of heir. So we’re flying and this tree is HUGE, it’s hundreds  of feet tall and as we’re getting closer to the top, for some reason, I stop flying and start falling. The kid saves me, saying he never wanted my title, and that it has too much responsibility attached to it. As we’re about to land, he drops me by accident, and I fall and land on my feet that causes  my ankle to swell up and the paramedics show up because my dad thought i was going to hurt the kid, but I go to the hospital instead and on my way there, my ankle is still swollen but it doesn't feel as though i landed on it from 50 feet in the air but for some reason i get the feeling thatI’m faking the pain, then I wake up.

I wish to know what this and my reactions in the dream mean.

IRL I'm the only child of my parents, I'm male and I'm in my mid 30s, married, with no children.

In the dream, as soon as I knew about her I managed to locate her and visited her home. I was already inside her house when she arrived (I know, stalker, much? sorry about that lol). I was super excited about what would come next.

She was opening the front door when she noticed someone was inside and hesitated, so I called her by her name. She asked, ""who's calling me?"" to which I replied, ""It's \[my full name\], your brother"".

After a few seconds she slowly came in, her eyes wide open in disbelief.

""Ohh noes..."" she muttered. I wondered if she knew about me the whole time.

""OH YES!"" I shouted back, and jumped to give her a huge hug.

Still hugging her, I asked her about her age. She told me, but I don't remember exactly. Something between 15 and 20. ""And why haven't I had you in my life until today?"" I asked with a stream of tears rolling down my cheeks.

Then I woke up. I didn't move, and tried to remember every little detail about the dream while crying silently next to my wife. I remember her name (her last name is very unique and doesn't match my family name), her face and hair, the way she was dressed, and especially how she felt during the long hug. But the thing I remember most perfectly is the emotions I felt.

Boy, were those some realistic and strong emotions. I've always wanted to have a sibling and in the dream I felt like it had suddenly become true, so I was overjoyed, but at the same time I was disappointed that we had missed so much time of being together. I was also angry or even resentful at my dad for having kept such a secret from me. And upon waking I was very sad to realise this wasn't real. But what was totally real was my reaction, because that was 100% honest me. My role in the dream was exactly how it would have gone if all of it had really happened.

It was such an emotional rollercoaster that I can't stop thinking about it and it brings tears to my eyes. It was difficult to type all this at work...

Anyway, I’m walking with a friend of mine that I don’t really talk to anymore. I don’t like her very much. She bad mouths another girl who I knew in the dream but can’t place irl. I eventually snapped and we walked our separate ways, now unfriendly towards each other.

It pretty much ends with me running to a big toilet, but then I see a man on the ground. 

Him: “what are you doing in here?”

Me: “uh... I have to pee. This is the women’s bathroom.”

He looked homeless and left. Before I even got to pee, a bunch of people enter too. Adults, teenagers, children, school classes. There’s one woman in the middle talking about something. She asks questions to the crowd around her. One tiny tiny girl takes her hand up and speaks very intelligently. She has the height of a three year old but the woman signals to me that she should be the height of a 9 year old. She also mouths “ I would be proud of her no matter what she looked like.”

The girl walks in circles, talking and talking and getting smaller and smaller. Eventually her face gets red and blue, and she stops talking. The woman picks her up and rocks her from side to side as she dies in her arms.

Apparently she knew the girl was going to die but never when.

Then it’s suddenly a New Years party thrown by the friend I don’t like and I’m trying to find some liquor. I pretty much wake up here. 

Anyone god any ideas of what these things could mean? There’s obviously some parallels like big and small but idk what it means",1570578998.0
464,Lucid/terror/anxiety dream?!,3,df1aov,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/df1aov/lucidterroranxiety_dream/,2,"I just had possibly the worst nightmare of my entire life. I don't know if you could call it a lucid dream or a night terror or something else, but here it is.

It felt like I was conscious. I was wearing the exact same clothes I am now, lying in the exact bed I'm in right now, but I was convinced that there was an enormous scaffold structure in the car park round the back of my flat, and that two versions of the same man were both at the top of the scaffold and waiting at the back door. I don't know who this man was, but he kind of looked like me.

It was terrifying how real it felt. I couldn't tell if it was a dream or reality, and during it I was telling myself that I need to call an ambulance and admit myself to a psych ward, but I was too scared to leave my flat, so I was in a sheer panic. I thought it would last forever, but I've just come round and am kind of ""normal"" again now.

For background, I struggle with anxiety and depression but not quite as severely as others. I've had two terrible nights sleep the past couple of nights because of illness, and I'm meant to be at work right now but had to leave because of said illness, so this is a dream that happened during the day. I don't know if those details help.

Has anyone experienced anything like this? It was honestly terrifying but I don't see how it fits into any recorded dream phenomena.",1570576254.0

Heres the dream:

In the dream i am in the bathroom and see my reflection.  My reflection in the mirror is me except the features of my face are gone.  Where my mouth an eyes and nose should be is just skin, however it does have  my hair.  As I continue to look into the mirror it seems the reflection is just a millisecond behind my movements as if my reflection is copying my movmenets no reflecting them.  And I feel a presence from my reflection and feel as thoug its staring at me.  I feel its stare even though my reflection has no eyes.  I continue to make movements and my relection continues to copy me continue to be slower than me by a milli-second.  I then place my face close the mirror my reflection does the same, and i place my hand to the mirror as does my reflection.  As mmy hand touche the mirror my reflection siezes my hand and clasps its fingers aroud mine.  I feel panic, and dread, and hostility.  My refection begins to pull me into the mirror and then i wake from my dream.

Thoughts?

I'd greatly appreciate all and any interpretations.

I knew I wasn't allowed in so I wandered off after watching for a bit. I passed a bridge over railroad tracks and came across some people who were in the tracks. We all joined together walking around what seemed to be a rural small town. We did things we wanted to do before dying, and planned on what we would do if we survived the explosion. At one point I saw the image of a girl praying inside a chapel, huge glass windows behind the altar, which the girl was facing. The bomb landed right outside the chapel window, shattering all the glass. The image changed to a group of people outside the chapel, the doors were closed. There was a loud explosion and a cloud of radiation sweeping through everything, destroying the landscape, but not too badly, on hills we could see ahead. As the smoke cloud progressed and where it passed became visible again, along with the mild destruction in it's path, I could see floating demonic red eyes, going slowly away. After this I don't remember much, though I do know it was a long dream, at one point we were at a bar where the bartender was a woman with a raspy voice. I also remember a dog and a lady in a wheelchair at some point. The strangest part of this dream is that I felt like I had seen a trailer of this dream before in my dreams. There were scenes in the dream that I could remember from dreaming about a type of trailer to this dream, the girl praying in front of the glass as the bomb exploded and the glass shattered in her direction was the most notable scene to me.",1570582476.0

First off, I wanna let you know that I don't really remember my dreams after a couple hours so I don't remember the exact details but it went something like this:


the first thing I can remember is me being in a train or a metro and I was being chased by someone. When I turn around to look, it's a friend of mine but and he was dressed up like Michael Gira from the band Swans. My brain probably made this up bc we mostly talk about music. 

So I manage to somehow escape from the subway and get to my home but he's still after me. I get home and go to my room then sit on the floor and put my back against a wall. There's a window right on top of me. All of sudden, he breaks the window and before I can move, he shoots me and I die. 

But then the weirder thing happens. I kinda get put back where I was a couple seconds ago like a checkpoint in a game and I'm not dead yet. So I turn around to the wall and see a little girl standing beside me. When my friend that's trying to kill me breaks the window and puts his inside the house, the little girl takes out a machete and puts it inside his head and just takes the head out of his neck. That shit was so brutal. Like she literally took it out with parts of his throat attached to it like it's no one's business.",1570594428.0

My name is Sarah in this dream. It was like I had just met him, maybe a week in but I was already infatuated. I knew he was married but found it kind of exciting to be his mistress. He told me he wanted something more official with me and we could only achieve it by being honest with his wife. We went to his house and there was a girl a little younger than him named Abbie that he was dating and already lived with them. His wife, Grace, was just arriving shortly after us. He tried to hide me in a bathroom but we knew I would be found. She came swiftly to the bathroom, she was a bit older than us but attractive. She had a gun ready for me when she entered the bathroom, hoping to scare me away, but he was in there with me talking her down. She was angry that he was trying to bring another woman in. She only agreed to allow Abbie on the grounds that she does all of the cleaning and house work, allowing Grace to focus on herself and her career. I couldn’t offer anything like that, I don’t make a lot of money either. I guess my dream was trying to become a wet one because I was really hoping it would turn into a threesom but of course I woke up. 

My boyfriend irl has told me he’s not into swinging or group play, but honestly I’ve always been attracted to sexual deviancy. I love him and have lived with him long enough to say I would be happy for the rest of my life with him, but am I putting my sexuality away too soon? Is this dream telling me I would do anything for him (allow a gun to be pointed at me for a chance to be with him). Is it making me confront 3 faces of my romantic self (the domesticated Abbie, dominating Grace, and sneaky Sarah are all me)? Is it telling me I want more before I settle down (do I really need to explore my bisexuality and attraction to older people)?",1570592979.0

So at the time my sister was away for university and she'd come back home for holidays or long weekends. We do  not watch the same shows or uptake a similar lifestyle. Anyway, i had a dream that it was nighttime. I woke up from my sleep (in my dream) and saw the hallway light on from underneath my bedroom door. I heard my mom and sister saying they needed to stack the boxes high to the ceiling to hide for reasons I dont remember (I believe there was a robber coming or something). I could see the boxes from underneath the door a bit and their shadows. Then I woke up. 
I went downstairs to tell my mom for fun about the dream I just had, and as I'm explaining it my sister ran down the stairs and said ""OMG I had the same dream!"" She said in her dream she was stacking boxes in the hallway with my mom to hide. There was a reason for the box stacking, but I honestly dont remember. I do believe it there was a robber they were aware of. 
Anyway, is this just a coincidence? Has this happened to anyone else? I just find it strange how we were in two different scenes in the dream. I have never run into a situation similar to this dream in real life.

I dreamed about pair of kids. They were a orphan boy and girl. They went on a magical journey in another world together where they met magical creatures and befriended a quirky demon who teased them relentlessly. 

At the end of their journey they returned home. Time passed. Not enough to grow up in any measure of the word but enough for them to get used to the real world again. They missed adventure but not enough to call the demon who teased them so. Thus they chose to have a small one in a near by orchard. 

Something terrible happened in that orchard. They met a group of men and were raped.

When they got back they tried to kill them selves but for some reason they couldn't die. So they decided to call the demon. He came with a smile on his face and asked what they wanted.

The kids told him that he could take whatever he wants as long as he kills those men.

That is when the demon saw thier wrists and as he saw this he could somehow see why. His smile became more plastered. It took a moment for him to answer before he told them ""Ill do it for free."" 

He dissipated.

After a while he returned and took the kids away back to that magical world. At this point the dream shifted to the voice of an old woman playing the narrator and she said, ""And so the hero's and the villian were never seen again.""

No one knew what was gonna happen to them, but we knew we wouldn't see them again.
Then my grandpa told me/showed me that all those extremely realistic animatronics in the amusement park were actually the dead bodies of guests in new clothes, with motors so they could move and some recorded sentences they could ""say"".
We got into a less crowded part of the park and it was full of those animatronics. They were everywhere. There was a street that was part of the scenery with some little shops (you couldn't enter them, they were just scenery) and they were full of those animatronics that would act like they were buying things, having a cup of coffee or just talking to other animatronics.
Then suddenly people began chasing us. I don't know if if was security or those animatronics, but if didn't feel good. We ran and tried to hide by going into the buildings but they always managed to find us.

This dream didn't feel like a nightmare, it didn't wake me up (as far as I know) but it feels really weird when I think about it. What does this dream mean? Or does it mean anything at all? I'm really curious.

478,A weird dream about a girl,1,df4dor,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/df4dor/a_weird_dream_about_a_girl/,3,"Woke up about an hour ago to a weird dream involving 16 year old me and a girl around the same age ( probably also 16). I have never seen this girl before and I don’t know what the meaning behind this dream js, if there is any meaning at all. 

So the dream started with me getting approached by this girl. And although i vividly remember her face, I knew she was beautiful and she felt like my soul mate. I have never really had a girlfriend since I was 12 so I don’t know if the feeling of overwhelmed joy and excitement is normal or an exaggeration. Most likely normal I’m probably just looking too far into this feeling. Anyway she showed great interest in me and asked me out. I accepted and next thing the I knew for some reason we were booking a flight to Antartica. In my dream Antartica was a lot like Canada and I remember us booking into a cabin in the middle of nowhere. I remember feeling so happy and fulfilled but at the same time I was nervous. I had a feeling of doubt and that she would leave me and I’d be left abandoned. This feeling of abandonment is a feeling I know all to well as I’ve experienced it on multiple occasions. First time being 9 when my mother passed away from cancer. It was a similar feeling and since then I’ve felt it in other dreams too. The most common dream I have is where I’m being left behind after school because I miss the bus and I’m left in am empty, desolate school with nobody in sight. I have that dream probably once every month. It’s a horrible feeling and once i started to feel it in this dream I knew something was wrong. Back to the dream, the sun was setting and we were outside of the log cabin and over looking the ocean with floating icebergs. The sunset with the cold, white snow was beautiful so I took out my phone and told her get close so we can take a selfie of ourselves  with the sunset and ocean behind us. As I went to take the picture I had this overwhelming feeling of doubt and sadness and without warning starting crying real loud into her shoulder. I feel asleep in my dream after that and awoke to being inside the cabin all alone with the girl nowhere in sight. It was nighttime by now and I searched the cabin calling her. I don’t even know if she had a name and I kept saying “sorry” out loud for some reason. Once I realised she was gone I walked outside, got on the ground and started crying with my hands behind my head. It was a feeling of loneliness and hopelessness. The last few seconds of that were bleak but I think i killed myself. 

I awoke with tears on my face and drenched in cold sweat. I really wish I had an explanation for this because it’s one of the worst dreams I’ve ever had and honestly felt so real. It’s hard to explain it but I think I might remember who the girl is. The girl in the dream reminded me of a girl I knew back in year 6. She was always kind to me and I even though she wasn’t one of my closest friends. I had a soft spot for her and really liked her. She left our town back in 2015. She started following me of Instagram last year and yesterday she posted a pic of herself with her boyfriend. I think that might if triggered the dream because the feeling of got from this dream girl reminded me of her.

Eventually our procession reached a lake, giving off steam in the cool morning. I heard that I must “strike three” and I knew what I had to do. A storm was brewing in the distance to the southeast. I knew we’d be caught in it but the people trusted me. I’d led them in storms before. We didn’t fear it.

These people are not my real-life family but dream-me knows that they are my adoptive family (which in itself is a bit odd since I'm 27). We all watch the last part of a ring-like horror movie together and then everyone goes about their own business. Pretty soon after I start to feel strange and dream-me knows I'm being possessed by the cursed movie. I find a mirror and I can see dark bags forming under my eyes (I feel them forming too) and my skin looks like cracked porcelain. I go to my dream parents for help, and find out that they get corrupted if I touch them and slowly die...this doesn't alarm dream-me very much though I do try to avoid touching the rest of my dream family. I go through cycles of being possessed and being normal until I eventually do end up touching and killing my entire dream-family. Only after the last of them is dead do I decide to break the cursed movie (it was a DVD) in half, thus freeing myself from the curse. I consider just living in my home with my dead family for a while, but out of the blue an evil priest shows up and starts trying to find me. I decide running is the best option, but not before I sneak around the house collecting my 3DS and all of my pokemon games. Once I have that all in a backpack I make a break for it and run up the street into the town centre. 

Once in the town centre I go into a crappy fast food place and try to get help, but only two people believe my story and agree to come with me to find the airport so I can flee the country. We leave together and that's the last I see of them since the next instant I'm sitting on a plane next to my best friend. She's making conversation with a guy sitting next to her and I join in since they're talking about the food we're having on the plane. Suddenly I realize that the evil priest is sitting next to the guy my friend and I are talking to and I warn them both that the priest is evil. Evil priest then proceeds to pull out a box cutter and stab best friend in the leg, telling her to leave his friend (the guy) alone. The flight attendant comes over at this part and politely asks the evil priest to stop stabbing the other passengers. 

I then look out the window and notice that our plane has turned into a buss and the billboards we're driving past are all sharing the breaking news that a bunch of shiny giratina (pokemon) have been killed in a terrorist attack. We see a giant giratina coming up behind the buss and pull into a strange shelter-like structure to hide from it. At this point evil priest grabs his friend by the hand and they run away. Everyone left on the buss proceed to open pokemon go on their phones and start summoning real-life pokemon to defend us. I spend the rest of the dream flying around on my shiny salamence while my mewtwo defends us (pokemon I actually do have on my pokemon go..strangely my dream version of the app was accurate).

I hope this is the appropriate place to post this but I would love it if someone could shed any light on what I keep experiencing.

Once or twice a year I have this same dream, I used to have it a lot more as a child but even when I have it now I wake up in hot sweats, shaking & not knowing where I am.

In the dream I am laid in a huge bed at the end of a long room facing a huge bay window with long draping blue curtains that are slightly parted. Behind the curtains you can see a bright moon shining through the gap in the curtains. On either sides of the room there's around 6 single beds either side filled with young sleeping children. It feels as though it's an orphanage. At the end of the room there's a red old fashioned see-saw being shined on by the moon. The see-saw slowly starts moving getting faster & faster until it becomes blurry. All of a sudden I hear a scream in my ear then I wake up petrified. I don't know why it scares me so much but I can't make sense of it at all.

The only think that seems familiar in this dream are the curtains, it seems similar to ones I used to have as a child.",1570551169.0

Anyways, so this dream I had last night... Was a little crazy. It started with a car crash that I walked away from, damaged my front right side but killed this lady that had ran a red light into me. I tried to do CPR on her and tried stopping the bleeding but it didn't work. A trooper pronounced her dead when he arrived. I went home and had a drink. 

My friend showed up without a shirt on, covered in blood. I was speechless and I was holding him by the shoulders asking him where he was bleeding from, what happened, etc. He wouldn't speak back to me, well he couldn't really.. eventually I realized that his throat had been slit open when I moved his head up. I also realized his intestines were beginning to fall out of the cut in his neck, idek if that's possible, but I felt them with my hand and tried to push them back in and tried to stop the bleeding again.. but like before, of course, I just had to watch as he died on my floor, gasping for air covered in his own blood and intestines. 

I was freaking out, having a panic attack in my dream at this point. I grabbed my shirt and realized I was still covered in the ladies dry blood from earlier, now mixed with my friends fresh blood all over me too. I woke up after I realized I was covered in their blood..

During the daytime, I found myself mumbling the words, ""I have been here before, and I know what you are going to do"". I was about to do something and I realized I was living out my past self.


""Thousands of years ago, participation mystique was the basic mode of human mental operation. The boundaries between dreaming and waking were blurred, as they were between different people, and between people and objects. Humanity had a liminal psyche, meaning that its psyche occupied a position at, or on both sides of, a boundary or threshold, blurring distinctions between things.""

----------------------


First dream scene: ""Fighting with this man""

I am on a pirate-ship-like construction, with free rein to go anywhere.. except there is a shadowy man who is ultimately following me and trying to eliminate me. He wears a black coat.

I look down to the beach, and as I have walked down here.. he is standing facing away from me over down by the water, like he has just got up.

I call out to someone ""allied"" with me: ""betrayal! the attack is on!""

Now we are in fight-or-flight mode. I race it to the nearest stockroom-type structure, looking for bandages. I know if I'm not patched up I can't fight. I'm trying to find something to hold my wrist together.. there is a flesh wound and it's come apart. [note 1] I can only find a small thin spool of sellotape.

I see the other allied man fighting my enemies. I can do nothing.

Dream scene ends.

------------------------


This dream scene begins as I had been walking around a place.. it's hard to describe this place in normal leftbrained terms because it conceptually serves two purposes on the boundary of two dream scenes [note 2]. First, the place becomes an outdoor area I am walking around, looking around: it is a grassy open-plan council estate which has raised platforms: going up towards higher levels where I could supposedly sleep sometimes; second [not ""later""], it is an enmormous open roofed bus shelter and subway. It is the same location, but it can morph between both utilities as needs arise. (This Harry Potter esque quality of it is very hard to explain in left brain terms, but I distinctly remember it being the same place in the dream). On the one hand it's outdoor, on the other hand it's indoor.. and it is also conceptually between destination on the one hand (council estate but not really where you'd want to see yourself living) and travel on the other hand (bus shelter and subway, where you are travelling but not quite moving yet).

I think that I might go and get to one of those upper areas, to see if I can live there.. my mind registers no sense of land ownership, laws or anything like that; I have only curiosity. So, I walk around some pathway with its own little stone staircases and bright green plants to the side; and I am slightly annoyed that I've ended up somewhere else, not able to find a direct route.


------------------------------

Dream scene: ""having fun with people""

I am at a pub/bar, it's lively. The walls are like thick wood from a tree. Everyone is happy.

My cousins are here; it's a big family. Lots of people are sitting around tables on one side of the pub.

I feel hungry so I go to get some food; I stand by the bar and wait. I see an attractive Asian girl in school clothing sitting at a table nearby.

I look in the large mirror behind the bar, and I'm female. I look attractive, with hair that comes down in two short sharp cut bangs around my face; dark brown hair. [note 3]

I look down and I am bare-footed. Someone shouts ""no shoes!"". I feel the weight of this as significant; this, combined with my hunger, is symbolic for something in this situation/scenario being very out of place. I don't feel bad for myself, I am trying to explore and such. I am getting hungry so I ask the bartender for something to eat. I start to go back over towards my family's area at the side of the room near the exit/entrance; I walk back over near where the Asian girl was sitting, deliberately, but she gets up without seeing me before I am near her, and walks off somewhere.

I try to get seated back at the cosy corner, but it's now jam-packed with people and we are literally squeezing past one another to get anywhere. We become stuck in 3-way traffic that is criss-crossing over itself. I am behind one of my cousins going for seconds with his plate, and I beg and plead with him: ""please. I haven't eaten yet"". At the same time I make a T-shape with my knife and fork while locking eyes with him. He seems to be bothered enough by my display.

A short while later it seems the traffic situation has changed. I am going to the other end of the room, just looking for a place to sit down in and hopefully eat, at some point. I make a mental note that I need the table number..

I am seated and I start talking to a distant relative, ""distant"" here meaning someone I rarely ever talk to; a cousin, who happens to be black (in real life, some of my cousins are black). We have this sort of rivalry energy. I end up saying to him all of this:

""There are around 13% of the population who are black, but there are incredibly rich people who have massive portions of wealth, and they are white. What we could do is redistribute the wealth proportional to how many people there actually are.. but I guess that would be socialism! HA!"" - at the same time I close a pamphlet I had brought with me and get on my way. He appreciates my humour and is content with it; we both sense that it's now something he will have to try and outdo.

I start to walk outside of the pub/bar area, into a wider complex; the same as before. It has the look and feel of a British council estate, but more open-plan and spatious with additional levels you can walk stairs up onto (out in the open with no roofs) to presumably live and sleep as you please.

(Boundary between dream scenes)

The council complex area has become a large open, airy bus station and subway station combined, with a roof that is incredibly high and also very wide. I am considering a different way to explore or go home. In my mind's eye I had been looking at a map with North-Eastern destinations right near the coastline, and I have picked one I'm interested in.

My mother appears, with the rest of my immediate close family tagging along, and she informs us we're leaving for a certain destination (a different one than I wanted) and I start to become noticably less lively or present in the moment or happy/joyful. My mother gets one whiff of this and goes on a short display of being in a huff, sulking, in imitation. I start to challenge her and defend myself starting with explaining that I'd wanted to go to a certain place to explore, when suddenly all of this is interrupted by the most strange, odd, unsettling, half-shrieking tone of voice she uses:

""Gerald!--""

My mother has stopped moving behind us, and I get the feeling she has been robbed by someone, so I rush over and feel empathic. However, I notice something is not right.

Somehow our conversation is started over more pleasantly now, as we walk separately from everyone else. I am able to calmly explain to her that I realize she is worried about me and wants to protect me; but that also ""there is another side, truth be told"". I can see in her face contorting that she is not happy with this, but I continue and explain that I am out to explore something new and I have a certain capability within me.

We now arrive at the bus station / subway, as this is the boundary to the next dream scene.

I get on the bus on my own (which is also very similar to a train, with spatious carriages and huge spaces between the seats). I walk over to a carriage with some laughing people on it, and then I sit down away from them near the entrance, smiling to myself. I am happy and content.

I see someone coming towards me - ""oh, hi Toby!"" - I invite him to sit down. (This was Toby from The Office). We start conversation and almost immediately he turns more into an Oscar; a hidden intellectual; also someone with a strong ""cultural"" background which is rather nebulous/vague to me. We somehow get talking again about the 13% versus 1% wealth disparity issue, and I retell it to him. He acknowledges it.

Eventually he tells me about a certain lady who is at our bus's destination, who we are to help for some unexplained reason, and he explains now that I have to say a special word (I presume that this is in her native language) to help her to correct me step-by-step whenever I can't do something right. He says the word is ""Luuiliam"". I try to pronounce it -- murky as it first sounds to me -- ""Luuulam"". I am skipping part at the end of it. He corrects it for me -- ""Luuiliam"" -- and I see the letters appear spelled out correctly in front of me. I struggle but seem to get it right this time.

We arrive at our destination, but for some reason he has become angry with me, he has become cold and won't open up. He starts muttering something under his breath, about how I don't need to help the lady. I distinctly remember watching his lips, with a sense that I am not welcome.

I look around to the supermarket behind me, and I see the green branded supermarket signage that makes the room feel very ""supermarket""-like. (There's always lights on, isn't there? And it's kind of barren in a way).

I turn back to my other side and I am magically at the exact right position to be at the checkout, with this woman who is dressed in strange tattered rags and a head wrap, and with the man from the bus. He looks at me blankly, saying nothing, then picks the woman's shopping and puts it next to her on the other side of the checkout. He is standing behind there, with her while I am on the other side. I go to pick up something to help the woman (I assume she can't do it on her own), and the man vanishes completely. I am shocked at his disappearance. The woman seems to be smiling and waiting patiently, doing nothing. I decide to persist and move some food items for her. I put some unwrapped bare chicken breast pieces on the smooth metal counter by her. Then I am placing on some pickled beetroot in a jar.. some more chicken (they are roughly cut, large shredded pieces) around it, almost by mistake. To my horror, the beetroot juice comes out of the jar and spills around the chicken, ruining it and making it appear like a bloodstained buzzsaw blade. I have completely messed up. I am totally distraught at this point, beside myself and in some sort of abstract pain. I put my hands on my face like I'm about to cry, and my face certainly has that expression on it, but I don't. I am extremely upset.

My mother suddenly appears from my side - ""we followed you when you left [on the bus]; we tend to keep an eye out on our family"".

Dream scene ends.

------------------------------------

What does the dream mean? Let's examine further and I will sum it up at the bottom.

------------------------------------


note 1:

In real life I have a mark on my wrist where I cut myself due to extreme stress. I cut myself with an industrial circular saw.


note 2:

This takes some explaining: the right brain is conceptual in a different way to the left, in that the left brain always wants to concretize everything and make its details certain (think boat building and engineering), whereas the right hemisphere can tolerate chaos and imprecise yet vivid definitions (abstract concepts). Intuitions, the unspoken insights behind our greatest discoveries and which we can never quite put into a description, and which we get instantly - are grasped by the right brain in the unconscious.


note 3:

I am male and usually think of myself as male while awake, but in dreams I rarely see my own body or have much sense of interacting with others at all. I know that rationality and intuition are genderless, so it makes more sense to me that my right brain and my Higher Self have no ""gender"". I was recently scouring someone's reddit posts and they reminded me strongly of a genderless impressive personality: some high amount of reasonable, gifted insight that I couldn't ever see in these comments was either male or female. It was like trying to find a needle in a haystack. Since then, it has recently occurred to me sometimes that I in myself am not only masculine but also feminine (Jung's psychology and alchemy book illustrates this area by making it clear that we all need to individuate both aspects into our personalities, as well as the Higher Self, so we are free from chasing anything that we lack in ourselves).


-----------------------


The dream's message is that ""this isn't for pleasing people"" (myself; my personality). As we get deeper into the dream, my commitments in engaging with other people get deeper and deeper, more and more ***disingenuous***, from the initial starting point of dialectical clashes of honesty (fighting and disagreement) to its polar opposite of meaningless busywork and toil that I didn't care for and which nobody asked for. Bare-footed = unprepared. I am ""exploring new lands"" but without genuine purpose. This is clearly then a problem that my waking self suffers from. I don't know where to draw the line. I don't organize myself. My Higher Self is messaging me some things that dovetail with my left brained, conscious inner work (individuation).

The ""wound"" on my wrist is symbolic for losing my sense of true self. If I am fighting my Jungian Shadow, then to become/embody less of him, I must stay my true self, separate from other people. This is the meaning of bandaging myself separately before I ""mix"" with someone even ""close"" to me. This has to do with my spiritual work on separating the massive flood of thoughts I can have about other peoples' lives in the world, with my own recognition that reality is based on mathematical waves and hence, whatever happens in one instance has no particular final bearing or ""stain"" on my own life or how I should feel -- how it should affect how I behave or live. I should instead live for myself, as needs must and as reason would otherwise dictate. I should be unaffected by the ***appearance*** of things, the ***being***, and focus also on the ***becoming*** aspect of reality & the collective.

The consistent threading theme we are seeing all the way through here, is the Higher Self (a component of the psyche which Jung was aware of) attempting to lift and elevate the waking self away from the trappings of its lower bindings (the realm of appearances; the ingrained ways we think; the ways we waste time or get things wrong). The right brain's special functioning here during dreams, has a purpose in trying to communicate with the left hemisphere of the brain to draw attention to a broader perspective, which -- unlike the left brain's concreteness and certainty -- is highly abstract, chaotic, contradictory and formed in a very different way.

""Luuiliam"" is very similar to the name of someone I dated, and if she was much older, then she would have resembled the gypsy woman in the dream. I was trying to help her, but I don't know why. This brings a lot of clarity to it for me, as I'd been having trouble getting over her. The dream posits perfectly that she is someone who would otherwise (in other ""skin"" or circumstances) be unknowable to me. That is a very striking thought indeed.

The right brain can help individuate how we think, away from its particular left brained pitfalls. The right brain is offering its assessments of where we keep making repeated, particular, knowable/intelligible failures (drawn up inaccuracies). This dialectical synthesis is to say that we are trying to combine both brain hemispheres so as to escape the limitations of both individual hemispheres on their own (and the suspiciously habitual mistakes that are to do with how one particular brain hemisphere is organized). To the right brain, you can have highly abstract vision with minimal detail filled out. The left brain is quite the reverse, seeking to hammer concreteness out of its concepts and mental content. Both of these approaches need to be respected, in all domains of life.

So I had a friend who was a serial killer, we all knew about it (group of friends) and we didn't really mind it. It was kind of interesting sometimes, you never knew when he would just flip out and just kill some random guy in front of us. I must admit that the first time it was incredibly grotesque, but we got used to it. Just as long as we don't get any blood on us it's fine. Generally he's very careful when he performs a murder, he's careful about cameras, other people, neighborhood, cops and all that. Just a couple of time we've had to help him.
I remember the last time we were in a bank, I don't know why it was open after 5, but anyways we were in there. It was empty except for us and a clerk. He saw the clerk and just jumped at him and killed him.. What and idiot- I thought - now we've got to get rid of the security footage. He went into the bathroom to clean himself while we handled the video cameras. The clerk was just lying there on the floor, lifeless in a pool of blood. Not even 5 minutes later a couple of guys came in looking for the clerk. They saw him on the floor and they saw us with the security tapes. Unfortunately they were friends with the dead guy, and pulled out some (knives I think) weapons? We ran as fast as we could into a room with a lot of columns and I hid wherever I could. The idiot was still in the bathroom! Why didn't he hear us scream and come help us? The two guys past beside me without looking and killed the rest of my friends, but when I thought I was safe and tried to sneak out, someone grab me by the arm and said, where do you think you're going?",1570554376.0

494,My weird disaster murder dream,2,dex6c8,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/dex6c8/my_weird_disaster_murder_dream/,0,"Before I get into it I do want to put a trigger warning about my dream, mostly because there was a corpse. The corpse wasn't based on reality, however, the situation surrounding it along with its condition were both very disturbing (to me at least). So here's the warning, be warned! 


My dream started in Minecraft, as silly as it sounds. I don't remember much of how it started, but there was a strong feeling of dread. 2 other people we're playing with me, and one of them was planning to do something horrible. He refused to tell me what he planned but said I could watch if I wanted. 


I went to the area they were in, and it started almost immediately. It was on a level with a natural disaster, with blocks beginning to break off buildings and forming a tornado. There was also lava, which seemed to be rising with every second. It became clear to me at this point that the ""revenge"" or ""prank"" the one guy had planned had gotten out of his control, as he was terrified. 


I started running up a hill in an attempt to escape the lava, but suddenly there was lava flowing from the top of the hill and I had no place to turn. In a last-ditch effort, I tried throwing an ender pearl in a random direction, only to end up in lava anyway. 


Then the dream suddenly changed to a real-world setting. Here, I was friends with a Man. I knew he had done something wrong, horribly wrong to someone young and close to me (I will refer to them as the Kid). I was worried and looking for the Kid. I remember the Man kept cooking for me, and I kept setting it to the side. At one point, the Man had made me scrambled eggs.


 Eventually, I found the Kid. He was dead, which wasn't surprising to me in the dream but I was still sad and horrified by it. The Kid had been shoved in a closet and burnt to the point of being unrecognizable, but somehow in the dream, I knew it was him. I was about to run, to find a way out of the house and away from the Man that did this, when I saw the scrambled eggs again. It had the Kid's finger in it. That's where the dream ended.",1570552468.0

496,God looks like Anthony Hopkins,2,dewu6p,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/dewu6p/god_looks_like_anthony_hopkins/,0,"I had a couple years ago with a guy in it who looked like Anthony Hopkins in a white fedora, Hawaiian shirt, white shorts, and sandles, but he sounded like Hopkins and Morgan Freeman speaking at exactly the same time. We were sitting at a table outside a Cafe in what resembled Italy. It almost felt like a scene out of Inception.

Me: who are you supposed to be, God?

H/F: Is that what you want me to be? Truthfully, I am merely a figment of your imagination. And a representation of your subconscious mind.

Me: why do you sound like Anthony Hopkins and Morgan Freeman talking at exactly the same time?

H/F: that is unimportant, this is simply the form you have chosen. You are dreaming. I am here to show you this place can be whatever you want it to be; because you are now aware of it, you can shape it to your desires.

Me: whatever I want?

H/F: indeed. Whatever you want it to be, it will be.

Me: I want Chinese food.

I'm serious, this is how it went. He said, ""ok,"" we got up and walked across the street to a mom & pop Chinese takeout complete with steam tables of food. Anthony Freeman bid me goodbye and good luck, and I started for the food. I chose sweet & sour chicken, orange chicken, pork fried rice, beef & broccoli, and water--why water? Because I knew I wouldn't be able to taste or feel it. I _could_ taste the sweet & sour chicken, but I didn't feel the food in my mouth and the water felt like nothing, which is normal for me. I've never seen the Hopkins Freeman man again in any other dream.

One of my tells that switches a dream to lucid is drinking water. I can't feel it, or taste it, drinking water in a dream for me has zero sensation, and I instantly realize I'm dreaming and go lucid from that point. So you will understand when, a week ago, while awake and not dreaming, I took a drink of water and immediately started to freak out because it felt like nothing, it was not cold, and I might as well have had nothing in my mouth. I took several more drinks and could feel the water after that, but the first one was nothing. Few things will make you question reality faster than something like this.",1570549887.0

501,First ever lucid dream,56,deivs9,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/deivs9/first_ever_lucid_dream/,4,"Just had my first lucid dream the other night that felt so strange I just wanted to share.

The dream started off quite simple. I saw myself laying in bed, however it was in my old room in my old house. Then all of a sudden it's like I was jolted into my own body, my eyes opened yet I couldn't move and it felt like my entire body was numb. First panic hit, but then I steadied my breathing and the sensation began to subside. I was now in control, I could see, sense and feel everything within the dream world. However I felt extremely weak, as if my muscles were drained from fighting off the paralysis. I've had sleep paralysis when waking up before, but never inside a dream.

I then proceeded to stumble out of my room, leaning against the wall to keep balanced, everything looked familiar yet slightly different. Family photos on the wall almost identical yet small differences(hair styles, clothes etc) I eventually got into the family room where I saw my  mother and sister talking. They asked me if everything was alright, so I then explained what was going on. They just smiled and said I must have had an interesting dream. But I continued to insist that this was the dream and that where I'm from i dont live here anymore and my sister hasn't been around for years.

It was then at that point right as my sister was about to speak that everything froze. Then from seemingly nowhere all I heard was ""You're not supposed to be here"" Not in a threatening tone, more so like it was curious.Then I blinked and all of a sudden was awake in my real bed and house. Like no time had passed and without the feeling of just waking up or being jolted out of a dream.

Just felt like sharing that for whatever reason. Totally felt like I spent a bit of time in an alternate reality lol.",1570480800.0

I wasnt actually there, it felt like I was simply watching, as if it was something on TV. The woman had the baby in her arms, and both the man and woman were just looking at the baby with smiles on their faces. Then, out of nowhere, an explosion happened. The three of them remained stationary in the same spot, and weren't moved by the explosion, but their skin was mostly burned off. The husband fell to the ground, apparently dead. The woman, who still had the baby in her arms, was missing all the skin on her hands and arms, and her face was burned and melted, and her eyes were gone. The baby was burned to a crisp, and its head just kinda popped off and blood squirted from its neck hole. The woman couldnt see the baby, but she felt around its body and noticed that its head was missing and that it had died. She was overcome with grief, dropped the baby, and then twisted and pulled her own head off before falling to the ground dead. 

After this, I shifted into another dream. I cant remember much of the second dream, but when I awoke, this first dream was burned into my memory. It was horrific and very worrying.

509,Frequent Bizarre/Almost Lucid Feeling dreams?,3,derudd,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/derudd/frequent_bizarrealmost_lucid_feeling_dreams/,1,"When other people talk about weird dreams, typically they say things like ""I had a dream I made out with my sister"" or ""I had a dream that I was giving a speech and realized I was in my underwear and then my teeth fell out."" This isn't what I mean by frequent ""bizarre"" dreams. At least once or twice a week I have extremely vivid, narrative dreams. I'll give you some examples from my dream journal:

*The sky was greyish and everything had a kind of dark feel to it, dead trees etc. I knew I was trying to break three girls out of a prison that was guarded by heavily armed muscular clowns/jesters. The prison was on an island that you could only reach by rope bridge, which I crossed and cut through the fence with some boltcutters to free them. We were chased by the clown guards until we reached a city that had a low-poly (Think PS1 style game) feel to it, and it was inhabited only by children. The alleyways were mazelike, and we ended up being chased by a Minotaur through the alleyways until we were able to hide in a house and he couldn't get his horns through the doorway.*

**Or another example:**

*I was in a place that I somehow knew was Israel, where I met up with a childhood friend who told me he had retired from the army and was there to help them deal with a dinosaur invasion. We got split up when a dragonlike dinosaur attacked us, and I ran into a bombed out building where a beautiful woman tried to seduce me only to reveal she was a shapeshifting dinosaur. So I ran to the sea and got on a surfboard and paddled out into the ocean before I came to a giant earthen dam and met with other surfing survivors of the dinosaur attack who were watching a movie on a big projector screen over the dam from their surfboards in the water. We were attacked again by dinosaurs so we got over the dam and paddled further out before I got lost and ended up floating to a place called ""San Marcos"" which was full of Maori looking people. A family there took me in, and their father was a dead ringer for David Duchovney and his first name was David. I told them about the dinosaur attack and they said they would be my new family since my old one had been killed. We went around the island of San Marcos doing various errands like getting groceries and going to the barbershop. Over the course of events I fell in love with the daughter of the family and the dream ended with me getting my head shaved in the barbershop after David told me I could only see his daughter if I was bald.*

So yeah, and there are many more like that. I've only kept a dream journal for the past year or so, so I've forgotten the details of a lot of the older ones. I have shared my dreams elsewhere and people have asked me what I'm on or how I have such vivid dreams and I don't really know what to say. I don't take illegal drugs or any medications, I rarely drink alcohol, and I wouldn't say I am particularly stressed plus I've had dreams like this my whole life. Does anyone else have naturally extremely vivid dreams with such bizarre content? Is there a cause? My mother has similarly vivid dreams so maybe its a genetic thing?

We had been dating about six months and one night while staying over at his place I had the first of many similar dreams.

I ask who are you? I think I know you. I look towards the  windshield and we are in a large red truck. My bf drove a blue Toyota Tacoma and that's what we had started out riding in in the beginning of the dream. He looks at me and smiles in a way that says, duh, you should know me! He then says I'm your Husband! I said no you're not, I'm not married. He just kept repeating that he was my husband. I woke up, thought it was odd, but felt so strange, like I knew this person. I'll try to shorten a long story. My bf and I later marry and have two sons. I continue to dream of this man to this day, even after 23 years!

Where my mouth an eyes and nose should be is just skin, however it does have  my hair.  As I continue to look into the mirror it seems the reflection is just a millisecond behind my movements as if my reflection is copying my movmenets no reflecting them.  And I feel a presence from my reflection and feel as thoug its staring at me.  I feel its stare even though my reflection has no eyes.  I continue to make movements and my relection continues to copy me continue to be slower than me by a milli-second.  I then place my face close the mirror my reflection does the same, and i place my hand to the mirror as does my reflection.

It was a normal summer day, sleepin in my room. In the dream, there was a creature that was sitting on a chair in my room. At some point I asked it what was he doing here. It stood up and everything startrd burning. My room transformed itself in hell (the generic image with a burning cave). Now with the fire all around, the creature had horns, goat legs and a muscular human torso. His voice was deep and raspy. He began speaking to me something that I can't remember but was very important. It was a question of yes or no. Also when he was speaking, there was a very eary noise of people screaming in agony, rusted metal being scratched and many other strange noises. Despite this, I wasn't scared at all, and was very happy seeing him, that made him visibly glad. Now the curious part. I answeared with a confident ""yes"", everyting stoped, the fire the noise and him.
The thing transformed into a suited man with a goaty holding a contract in his hand, that I signed.
He put it into the suitcase. Told me ""Thank you for your cooperation and we will meet when it is time to meet. And then he left through the door.

Normally, I would belive it's a bad dream, but I woke up covered in sweat in a cold room in the middle of summer with a feeling that something important really happened.

To the point that I get disappointed upon waking that they aren’t real. I want to remember these dreams in detail to use them somehow in drawing or story telling. They cling to my waking life and I’ve actually avoided major bad shit from happening by following some sense in them. After waking I try to get as much out as I can and often forget that I have them until reading over them later. I’m sure many here do the same. This is one of the most recent:
     I was telling my mom how I’ve been waking up unable to sleep lately. She’s telling me that we take the burden of responsibility hard. That’s why. We can’t shut it down. Go through this back yard. And some point I’m on this train. With this weird crew. Three people. A girl and a boy. There’s a bed in the middle. They’re asking where I’m going to
Sit. Weird animals. This guy I’m with is hypnotizing these birds. They just freeze mid air and then shoot off into this corner. Flatulating. There is a boy in the corner. There is a feral child there that can’t speak English. Is learning. I go to leave and try to figure out where I am. There is this man in the front room. I’m walking through this water and these bugs are attaching to me. At my feet. I climb down this railing the ceiling gives way everyone laughs. I ask this guy where I’m at. That I can’t remember where I am. That I just woke up here. Hes using sign language at me very forcefully repeatedly then as I repeat him and try to remember for a later translation he becomes more and more soulful. And starts this Indian traditional dance. And I’m basically just mesmerized and understanding him though this dance. Then he has others show up and dance around me. The feeling is so intensely spiritual that I can hardly take it. There are all sorts of cars. At one point someone asks me if they are Stanly’s cars. Art car type stuff. This couple stops me at this mall and asks me for directions I tell them I don’t know where they’re at. Some guy tries to get into my wallet. And makes fun of the bag of food I have that starts spilling its contents. I tell him that it’s the hardest and most tasty thing I’ve ever eaten. I fall next to Fariha and decide I’m going to lay there with her. All of these people have this frog like pattern on legs. And she’s like going to be my girlfriend now.

519,The Horror Maze,6,deodnv,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/deodnv/the_horror_maze/,0,"This is a dream I had exactly ten years ago that has stood out to me, I'd love to hear everyone's input/thoughts on it. But please be warned, it's very long (and downright ridiculous in parts). I have a lot of 'out there' dreams quite often, and I usually just figure it's from being a gamer/writer. 

&#x200B;

**TL;DR**: A high ranked angel with two giant wolves kicked monster butt and whenever I'd get spooked, I'd feel better thinking about those wolves. 

The dream started out with me going to what I thought was a haunted house with one of my internet buddies that I'd met on Gaia Online. We were there with different groups of people wandering around this warped maze and had no clue about the dangers within it. When we heard people screaming in terror, we just rolled our eyes and joked about it (cause irl, we are pretty hard to scare), unknowing to the fact that they were actual screams of pain. It wasn't until we got further into the maze and started feeling *off* that we realized something was wrong. When we passed by a group on the opposite hedge from us, their screams warped into a guttural snarl. I remember looking at my friend, about to voice my concerns when I noticed his features looked like they were beginning to darken and twist into something not human. Almost like something was trying to possess him. Little did we know, all around us, the visitors to that maze were transforming into monsters/demons all around us. Right when I was about to ask if he was alright, Freddy Krueger comes around the corner and starts smack talking us.

Now, let me just mention a little fun fact here before I continue. I have always loved Mr. Krueger. As corny as the nightmare movies were, he just never scared me, even as a kid. Heck, I've always thought Robert Englund was a handsome man either way, and I'd dreamed of Freddy in the past...and whenever he'd try to scare me or threaten me, I'd always laughed at him. 

Getting back to the dream, I had rolled my eyes and laughed at him when he insulted us, but he suddenly transformed into a beefy soldier (who resembled Chris Redfield a GREAT deal; it was around the time RE5 came out and I was playing it a lot) who suddenly had a machine gun in tow. I had an 'OShi--' moment and tackled my friend into a conveniently out of placed closet and slammed the door closed. Freddy Soldier proceeded to open fire on the hedge closet, cackling like a madman the whole time. Now, naturally a closet door wouldn't stand a chance and would be torn to shreds. But this one? It just had scattered holes punched through it. As dust was settling, I heard two howls simultaneously break the silence. A bright light all but erupted from the closet, causing Soldier Freddy to shield his gaze as two magnificent white wolves burst out from inside and charged past him. They proceeded to run throughout the entire maze, darting by every single person whom had become possessed and 'cleansed' every last one of them. 

&#x200B;

When Krueger lowered his arm and looked at the closet, an angel emerged from within. (I'm still unclear if she was a guardian, or if it was me) She had somewhat short hair that appeared silver/white but glinted with a rainbow of color in the brilliant light she radiated. She wore elegant gloves that reached up past her elbows and had feathers adorning their sides and a gorgeous gown/sash made of silk or satin ribbons. Her legs were adorned with stockings that reached up to her calves but exposed her feet, wrapping around beneath the heel of them. Her eyes were the the lightest shade of blue and turned as dark as the ocean when she stared down Krueger and her many wings were a large, flowing trail of feathers behind her that stretched out to their full extent and length as she turned to watch her two wolf companions return to her side. They both had long, bushy tails and coats of pure soft silver and they too emitted the same strange light\~aura she did. Freddy was about to unleash bullet hell on her and  all she did was wave her arm and he straight up vanished. When she turned back to the closet to check on my friend, it wasn't him who emerged. It was someone in a mecha suit that looked a lot like Zero from Megaman (my friend LOVED the franchise and Zero was his favorite character). Determined to banish the darkness from him, the two began to square off against one another. Mecha Zero blasted the Seraphic entity with two guns and she 'aimed' her wings at him and feathers shot out and lodged into his suit, like long arrows. 

I woke up before I could see the outcome of the dream. But what I took away from it was that I'd always think of those two wolves whenever I was ghost hunting with friends or just scared by something in general. I felt like they protected/watched over me. I even named them, but I read years ago that you should never name spirits for they might be offended, especially if they already have names. I haven't' felt their presence in quite a few years now, but I think that's because I fell out of touch with my spiritual self. 

Long story short, I have a wild imagination that likely stems from too many video games/anime and all that other good stuff.

We were in a cafeteria getting some drinking fountain soft drinks when all of a sudden, I see a kid I would talk to every now and then named Charlie.( Now let me shift back to real life. Charlie was an easy going kid who hung out with some burnouts, but he was a reliable kid and most people didn't have a bad thing to say about him other than maybe he was non-ambitious. I knew him since i was about 8 or 9. I am 27 now. In 2014, he was stabbed to death by a methhead who was dating his mom. The methhead also tried to kill Charlie's mom and his sister and then tried to kill himself. They all survived, except Charlie. It was really tragic in our hometown and exteemely saddening to his close friends.) 

Now back to the dream. I see Charlie and I immediately become filled with joy, like I hadn't seen him in a long time and something in the back of my dream-filled mind lets me know that he is actually dead. Everyone around him is so happy to see him. I decided to give him a full on man hug. Now, this is where I experienced something i never have before. Immediately after I hug him, i get this amazing, indescribable feeling. My vision changed to the purest, golden light that can only be described as the most comfortable, perfect feeling anyone could probably have. (Similar to having a perfect psychedlic drug experience, but way better) It felt so positive and right. I think Charlie spoke to me, but i can't really recall anything as far as words or subject matter. Don't really remember much at all after that. Just remember waking up and feeling like i had been positively changed or positively traumatized, if that makes sense. 

Was this a real connection to the afterlife? Idk. I have never experienced or even tried to experience anything like that before. 

Anyone else had something similar?",1570538853.0
523,Recurring dreams of guy I grew up with,1,dev1e8,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/dev1e8/recurring_dreams_of_guy_i_grew_up_with/,0,"For years now I have been having recurring dreams of a guy I knew when I was much younger.  We first became friends when we were in sixth grade and continued our friendship for the next year or so, culminating in us ""dating"" for a week in middle school (I ""broke up"" with him), after which we pretty much stopped talking.

I'm 29 now.  I've had plenty of boyfriends and love interests over the years, but for some reason, I cannot get this guy out of my mind.  He's the only person I've consistently dreamt about over the years.

I've often wondered what it would be like to get back in touch with him, but unfortunately he seems to be completely absent from social media, and last I heard he was living on the other side of the country.",1570537249.0

We had an uncanny bond mentally/emotionally. Once I dreamed of something he had drawn. He was never interested in me romantically.... and came out in high school. My heart swells with happiness for his strength in being open and in some way it was a relief; to know we could never be a thing. 

Still, every now and then, I have dreams that he and I are together. There’s a calmness and a sense of mutual acceptance and love. It’s funny how the mind manifests our deepest truths in vivid dreams.",1570504509.0

When i opened the doors i saw a soldier who said to me ""Its time for you do do your job"" and he told me to follow him. We were walking trough some halls, they were clean and made out of metal and to me they seemed like those halls of an underground bunker, the hall was so long that i could not see its end, we passed next to a few doors and windows while walking. The colors of the hall were greyish but i could see all the bright colours trough the windows

After a long walk he stopped in front of some big doors and told me ""The battle is over"" and the doors opened. The room that i walked in had very high ceilings and the walls had been covered with monitors, it looked somewhat like an airport control room but bigger and with more people

On the monitors i could see a list of strategic and civilian targets and a lot of world maps

The soldier led me to my table, that was in middle of the whole room and told me to press the button on the table. Everyone in the room started looking at me and then i realised that i am about to launch a nuclear missile. I was thinking to myself that i had no options, so i pressed the button. The moment i did that everything started shaking and over all monitors i could see the destruction i brought upon humanity, all the explosions and deaths. I remember that one of monitors was showing text that said ""NUMBER OF DEATHS"" when i pressed the button the numbers have gone insane (i also remember seeing a number thats way biigger than there are people on earth, but thats a dream anyways)

I started crying while the world was dying and remembering all my friends, i had also screamed a lot of things (including the name of my sister, mom and dad and the name of my ex gf, and that i am sorry for what had happened)

I woke up and ran to the window and realised it was all a dream

I remember seeing a long row of opened mailboxes, and I open mine. A small envlope with a thin 5cm black syringe with a cap, and a card attached. I had already accepted the meaning of the situation, but I read the card anyways and it quoted something from the bible. Something I deeply feared yet understood. So I sprayed the poison unto my hand to examine, and I did see the name of the drug, though I had forgotten. It had started with a C and it was a green paint-like substance. I was intensely scared of this position.

I am not entirely sure why, but I had a sort of conviction to carry through. I injected it and I knew it was suppose to provide a painless death. After the injection I began walking and no one was to be seen, I was hallucinating and suddenly felt very apologetic and guilt in which I did not want to leave

I was standing in a big garage like room, with long tables full of faceless people. I turned around and i saw my great uncle B and my grandfather. So I've gathered the people in this room are all dead. I sit with them and start eating and visiting. I look to my other side and i see my great uncle J... Just eating quietly. These two are my grandfather's brothers so you have a guess at the age group. 
The next day, i called someone who would listen and not pass judgement. I called my grandfather's favorite cousin V. I told her about the dream..
V: So what are you thinking?
Me: Honestly? I think J is next. 
V: what do you mean?
Me: Not like next in the family but...next of grandpa's siblings.
V:...
Me: i don't know how, but i think he's next. Please, if you can, keep an eye on him.
V: I'll do my best but if he leaves the state again thats going to be hard. 

Usually when i have a dream that i really feel is prophetic and i tell someone...it doesn't happen, but if i keep it to myself it happens. Damned if i do, damned if i don't.
 
But over the next several years none of my greats had died.

Summer 2012 I'm on the phone with my great aunt L, we were pretty close, and she tells me that V is in the early stages of dementia. My thoughts: great...the one person who knows is slowly going off the deep end. (I'm really fond of my cousin V even though the last update i got was 2 years ago and she's probably passed by now so dont get me wrong.) I then tell aunt L since we're talking about V. And i tell mom who of course cant do a damn thing except listen but i feel like someone has to know.

Winter 2012 i get a text from my brother
 Call dad.
 I call dad.

*TW — Trigger warning* content involving suicide 

Spirits were an open topic in my household. Both of my parents delved in various forms of spirituality, both had their own accounts of interactions with the mysterious “spiritual dimension”. Of all my mother’s stories, this one is the most chilling.

About 22 years ago, my mother had a dream that shut her off from any thoughts of spirits. At the time, she was reading The Tibetan Book of the Dead. This text translates the Tibetan Buddhist philosophy of both life and the process of death. (Side note: I recommend it to all readers. There’s some great philosophy in there) One night, she wakes into what she described as a half-dream like state. She had woken because she heard a scream, gaining in intensity. When she opened her eyes, she was met with a gaze of our neighbor; a ghostly image at the side of her bed. In that moment, she said she could feel all of his pain. It was the worst emotional agony she had ever felt. When she fully awoke, he vanished. Later on, my parents were told that this man had hung himself in his garage that night. As you can imagine, the shock to my mother was overwhelming.

Instead I saw a flock of pelicans fly by the door outside. I looked it up on google what doves mean in a dream and it mentioned something to do with death. My theory is that, since I wasn’t dying and didn’t know anyone who was, my dream wouldn’t show the doves I wanted to see. So, it showed pelicans instead. The dream interpretation for pelicans says you are taking care of others and it happens that you sometimes forget about yourself.

Apparently jagger has been through a lot ever since he was a child, which i picked up on anyway. in both real life and in this dream. i tell him how i can tell when people have been through a lot or are going through a lot. i can see it in their eyes and the way they talk. it's obvious, as are ulterior motives and wishes. the principal says he doesn't even get how i can do that. it's really heard for him. he leaves, but not after getting a good feel of me. again, i really don't care. i'm bored. i'm tired. nobody's looking and nobody cares. and if they are looking, they still don't care. i go back over to my friends, who probably aren't actually my friends but two of them are arguing and it's getting intense. i duck as some guy pops his head over the railing at the front of the seats at the top of the bleachers to jeer at a friend behind me. anyways, the argument has now escalated to the point the girls are physically fighting, and our entire group is standing, yet still unnoticed by everyone watching the game. a girl joins the argument, pulling out a knife, and i try to yell for help, but nobody hears me, or they just don't care. she cuts HERSELF. deep. i snatch the knife and wave it in the air, still screaming for help. all the other girls have already run away. i look over at the knife wielding maniac, and she's pissed. which is probably cause i took her knife, but whatever. she doesn't speak, but we're now in something like a dorm/ school that looks like a giant plantation mansion with maybe classrooms but definitely bedrooms and bathrooms. our maniac is now on the floor, passed out. i call the ambulance and the responder is annoyingly calm. i keep having to make sure he's actually still on the phone and hasn't hung up on me, and i'm screaming about the situation, giving him the address of (an old irl friend) and he hangs up. assuming they're still coming, i go to find the girl. by the way, she has blue hair. like teal-blue. and this pretty olive skin and big eyes. this time, she's running the bath and has a hairdryer in her hand, and i remember feeling so, so, sad and feeling so much for her. it was like i could see the sadness inside her leaking out. which is a common thing in my dreams. things people are feeling or thinking inside leak out of them in colors. for her, it was black and blue. it's kinda like smoke, or blue iodine vapor. really specific. anyways, i run to grab it before she gets in and drops it. by the power of good dreams, i succeed and she's once again pissed. according to her, i just don't get it, but i do. i was just like her like three years ago and i show her my (real) scars and manage to calm her down. this is the first time we actually maintain eye contact, and i see all the sadness in her face. in her eyes. i don't think she's slept either, and she surely hasn't eaten anything in twice as long. she's tiny. I'm 5'1 and 120 lbs, and she's TINY. maybe the same height as me, but i'm not sure because we never stand together long enough for me to see, but she's definitely skinny. her nose is little and pointy, and none of these details are actually important but she's SO beautiful and adorable to me. at this point i've basically fallen all the way in love with her, and i've been staring at her for what should be an inappropriate amount of time, but i ask if she needs clothes for the hospital, to which she nods. i figure she doesn't live here because i've never seen her and if i did i would have remembered. we dig through my clothes and i find things for her to take, along with some deodorant and toothpaste and other things you need for a suicide watch visit. i also figure she's been before, because we have a mutual knowledge of what she needs, and i haven't judged and still don't judge. again, i was exactly the same. as we wait, she draws, writing their pronouns down in pink lettering. this is SO detailed but it was so real. i felt and saw everything and the colors were vivid and expressive just like real life. i now know they're possibly non-binary, and we hear the ambulance approach. at first, i think about asking for their number, but i know they'll take her phone so i write mine down on their paper full of doodles so they can call me when they're getting ready to be discharged. they stand, i sit. they kiss me on my cheeks and nose and i try to kiss back, but my lips are super fucking chapped and dry and i can't really open them, which i explain to them. they laugh and i frown. we exchange a hug, and the bored staff put them in a stretcher, and i finally wake up.",1570502559.0

554,Weird and Kinda Scary/Unsettling Dream,3,deik6w,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/deik6w/weird_and_kinda_scaryunsettling_dream/,1,"Okay so, it was approximately 3 am, and I was in my bedroom, not sleeping but was in bed. I glance out my bedroom window, (the curtains were open for some reason, which is weird because I rarely open them and don't leave them open at night) and I see the moon looking extra large and red (blood moon. So I go to search for my phone to get a picture cuz this is cool. I manage to find it, open the camera app, but by that point the red is gone. I take several pictures then look out the window again just in time to see the moon pass really quickly over the top of my house looking huge (as if it were only half a mile away) For some reason almost everyone in the neighborhood is outside at this point and my neighbor is outside walking her 3 dogs, on of which is actually dead in real life. The dogs freak out and for a split second, I get a mental image of Jigsaw in my head. I start to panic at this point, but am still looking out the window to see a lot of bizarre things. (A Minecraft Enderman is the one I remember but there was more stuff) I go to my mother's bedroom and tell her everything that happened and she starts getting up, and preparing for me, her and the dog to leave. I head back to my bedroom to get dressed and I see someone we know outside, ""borrowing"" my mom's car. The thing is, the car doesn't work, it won't even leave the driveway, but she manages to get it started, and she drives away. About this time, my dream ended because I was woken up by tapping on my window.",1570479042.0
555,"Redhead with green eyes, weird lucid dream! (Need help understanding it)",1,demm3x,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/demm3x/redhead_with_green_eyes_weird_lucid_dream_need/,0,"Hello, 

I am no stranger towards lucid dreams, or out of body experience. In the same fashion, I used to have them every day as growing up through my teen years. However, this one was a bit different, and a little more real than ""my"" usual lucid dreaming experience. 

I'll physically describe the woman, so you have a better understanding of her.  

A young woman around the same age as me (I am 22-year-old male), super-bright ginger hair, but redder. Moreover, bright clean green eyes, by that I mean like just generally beautiful green eyes that just pop in your face, I have never seen anything like that before. Pale white skin, and overall I feel very calm when I am around her in the dream.  

\*back to dream\* 

First one 2 weeks ago, I was kinda going in and out within the dream exploring this forest, and I found her next to this cabin. We didn't talk, nor say a word, but just eye contact. The more we looked, the more we understood until the erotic part started. But it wasn't like any other sex dream I had, like I felt everything beyond everything. The weirdest part of the dream, we did not break eye contact once. 

The dream I had today: the same woman, never have I seen her in my life, but before I just remember those green eyes, and how physically I just couldn't do anything. As if, just looking at her eyes made everything just go away, melt, and it was just me, and this redhead in a bed looking at each other, until we started kissing (a bed I have also never seen before). A very old style bed too. 

Now, I do have mixed feelings, because I feel good within the dream, but mixed afterward - however, I feel like I am not really in control, like the usual setting for me within a lucid dream I act on logic and instinct, but this was different. As if it wasn't logic, nor instinct, but a calling. 

&#x200B;

Thank you for reading, and I would love to hear your feedback (super open-minded, so hit me with the first idea that comes to your head, or what does it really mean to dream about this kind of redhead) I couldn't find anything online.",1570497870.0

Sometimes the highways have these super complicated interchanges with extremely high ramps and bridges, and other times they lead to weird places (one time I dreamt that a local DFW highway had a dead end at a casino strip in the middle of some desert).

Dream started by knocking at my friend Betty's house (She use to be a friend of mine that I had a thing for, but she passed away). I wanted to stick around but she wanted me to go.  attention is drawn to a nearby window. Large Military ships carrying fighter jets and Missiles can be seen cruising down the river and the environment turns dark and stormy.  Then a random guy from class (David Lee?) Appears at the top of the stairs in his underwear. I go to leave but when I open the door some of her many cats get out and I have to round them back in. I finally manage to leave and head down the street towards the bridge. I find my friend friend Justin standing by his car, waiting. Humvee military vehicles occasionally pass us.  I ask him for a ride but he says he's busy with other friends right now as I turn to see them in the car. I walk to another house in the opposite direction that overlooks a cliff. I have come for what appears to be an interview at a restaurant/home set up.  I walked past the dining/living room that has an elderly woman sitting on sofa; the decor is old and grungy, much like the oldy lady. I reach the kitchen, which on the contrary is modern and clean, and begin my interview with an older and clean looking couple. They have me do a test where I chop up a salad and present it to them. I seem to get the job and they tell me to have the oldy grungy lady in the living room show me how to set the table. When I walk over I find her with her head back on the sofa, frozen and presumably dead. I head back to the kitchen to let the couple know but I see them frozen in place while standing up. I run back to get out of the house but begin to levitate to the ceiling. My head hits the ceiling and I immediately wake up (Now IRL) to the sound of firetrucks passing my home. They sound like distorted screams to me in my semi-lucid state.",1570477412.0
561,Bare w me I'm tired,3,degpk6,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/degpk6/bare_w_me_im_tired/,1,"Little bit of back story, I've had dreams involving this blue flower or some shit like 30 plus times and they've always taken place in the past and I would have to do numerous chores for ancient beings and when done the flower would appear out of the ground and in the water, so obviously I was like oh the ancient ones have shown they're gratitude I better yoink the boi and keep em, but as soon as I grab the flower I either wake up or I'm in a different place in the past. I had dreams like this for months straight and then it all stopped abruptly once I finally took the flower and saw myself holding it in my hand but like in third person kind of, like not my perspective. Super trip anyways here ya go. 

So it was in the future but not too far in the future but like all the people from my school and other people in they age group were there and everyone was walking up this giant hill and I was like wtf is this and so I parked my car and started walking up with them and I asked around and people only said  ""if you dont know then you dont know."" . Eventually i found one of my old friends, I knew if I asked the right questions I could get the answer I need just because of how me and this dude used to be, so i was like ""bro you're not gonna do it are you?"" And of course he was like ""I mean I'll drink the shit but idk about the flower I really only came for the steak"" And that instantly gave me flashbacks of all the fucking trials I did in my other dreams so I was like oh shit this is about to be good. Well when we made it to the top of the hill we were on a road called memory lane, it was just a road, but once you reached it you had to walk past every home you've lived in, and every house you've ever been to. Most people were already out but it took my moving every second ass a while. And by the time I came out we were no longer on a road but in a playground. The playground was basically are last chance to turn back and our last chance to socialize. (And what's even weirder is How the dream before this ties into it so perfectly with no foreshadowing at all.) But yeah alot of people turned back. I told my friend I'd do it if he did it but hed have to explain it to me completley. And he did, basically there was this ritual only people of a certain age were invited to meant to show the truth. And it was kind of like everybody is doing it we have to do it kinda thing. And I think the year was 2035 but I'm not sure I just know we were in our 20s and we are all like 18 now.  But somehow I became the cook and one of the people who ran the shit came up to me and was like please be seated and I had to explain like oh no I work here and then I had a flashback to my real life job at petland and started thinking how did I really get here? And then I went over to the table and started serving people their food and I saw my brother in laws little brother and to put it simply I was not happy. I was like what the fuck are you doing here you are not allowed. And he said oh God here we go hes gonna tell my mother. And I started to crouch down to where he was seated and started telling him Ethan it's not that I'm gonna tell your mom it's that I, i then got cut off by the same dude that told me to be seated and he was like good because i would have to gut you. And I knew somehow exactly what to do and I stood up cut his hand and then mine but like his right one and my right one and shook hands with him twice. The first time I swore to the order. The second time was an oath to silence. And he nodded and told me not to worry because my brother in laws little brother didn't actually do the ritual and he got upset about it and eventually left.
 Well
The ritual is. 
1 gallon of some dark red liquid? 
I dont think its blood i dont think they would do that 
It's probably wine but honestly could be anything. 
And then you eat all of the steak 
You then you'll have to rinse it out with a gallon of red koolaid. 
And then consume that damn flower
And I believe they were using humans bodies as like a filter/vessel for whatever they were producing. But everybody was out at that point. 
I stayed around to see if anything crazy would happen but after a few hours the people from the prder came in and looked around and said ah yes we've already checked in with the south so if the north and west have begun this will fix their atmosphere. at that point I told em ima dip gotta go get the girl. And they had me do the same oath of silence and has me swear to the order for each member. 
For some reason I had my step dads pryus, apparently something happened to him and he wasnt around and mom was always at work. But besides the point, I made it to the girls house and it was very very different. And of course her parents didnt want me to come in if they were asleep but idc. I walked in went into her room and she was starting up at the moon and the sun. 
I'd say it was around 6 PM. The sun shining bright af, but the moon there in the distance
She looked up for a second and then turned around back to me and we started kissing and I layed her on the bed and asked her where her parents were and if she wanted to come with. And she was like oh they're in there sleeping you should go before they wake up. We had along conversation talked for about an hour and the sun started to go down, but I made it outside with some shit she wanted me to take to my house because she planned on moving in since she was done with college. And I made it outside but I dropped a movie in her pond. And it was a very tiny pond like 🏃‍♀️ this being a human (.....) was the size of the pond. Anyways I went down to pick it up and dropped something else, tried to grab it again and dropped my phone. Eventually I had dropped everything and just put my head in the water because I couldnt see where the shit went without doing so. Well I got it all back and started walking to my car but then noticed my girlfriend was walking over to me. She started telling me ""you already know, you've known all along for you were chosen to know. Why don't you just know"" 

I did not know. 

But then the sun started getting darker. And it exploded 
As it exploded it turned into orbs of energy or light flying around the earth and all the stars and cloud dissapeared. She told me about how the earth is really contained inside of a temple. We were a test for an ancient but advanced civilization in space similar to humans, wondering how we would have been if we never had the technological boom, if we had limited resources, if we were left to our own devices which apparently they were humans, became addicted to progress, became androids, and then were basically capable of some kirby type shit, like you are what the fuck you eat when your them dude.  They tried to put us on Mars but they kinds made it go big boom instead of little boom, So they took over the dinosaurs planet and decided it was the right one. Then they put the earliest ancestors to man on the planet. They made a temple around the planet and a spell that was unbreakable until knowledge had been recycled numerous amounts of times. Space wasnt space how we know it, we were shown a fake space, all the planets where nasa has robots taking footage and images were actually fake planets and space put into the temple to keep us from seeing the abundant life off of our planet. Now keep in mind these people were developed and sophisticated, to us they used magic but in reality it was science, like Our universe was there but it wasnt really the universe. And now that the spell was broken. Everyone on earth was in a panic. Ten giant stone pillars fell around the earth, and I was like well it's time to dip so me and girl got in the car and drove. After I proposed to her and she said yeah sure ofc cause ya know sun kinda exploded. Anyways yeah I woke up and I hate myself because that was a 10 out of 10 dream. Wish I could've seen what happened next cause that shit felt real as fuck and I was in control of my thoughts and actions. Again 10/10. Sorry there are typos or if shit doesnt make sense its 440 am and I've been moving things since 130 PM and I have work in 5 1/2 hours. Goodnight reddit hope you enjoy.",1570466644.0

566,Why do I always dream about my teeth and my father ?,2,dehavm,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/dehavm/why_do_i_always_dream_about_my_teeth_and_my_father/,4,"I've always had disturbing dreams. Last night I dreamed about my teeth again and don't know what it means. Let me tell you what was my dream about. (to better visualize the story, I'm a girl and I'm 20)

In my dream, I don't remember how, I was under the influence of a young man and his mother. 
The man stole both my front teeth while I was drugged. He remplaced them with one single bigger tooth from an unknown animal. When I woke up after this ""surgery"" and saw the horrible result, my first instinct was to think ""It's ok, my front teeth are repairable. I'm glad he did not steal my extra tooth.""
(when I was a child, I really used to have an extra tooth. It has been broken on accident)

The man and his mother were not aggressive at all to me. They were just really weird to each other, having insane conversations. I wasn't captive, I just had no way to go back home. 
The mother said they had to do something important in town and she gave to me the keys of their boat for me to sleep in. I'm afraid of ocean but I had to say yes. So I went to sleep in the boat while they two went away with their car. Then I realised I wasn't alone on board, there was also a man. Actually he was my father, but in my dream we did not know each other. I don't know if we were even related.

He convinced me to start the boat. He said I should trust him if I did not want to lose more of my teeth. The sea was rough and I fell overboard. I do not know how to swim well and I struggled in the water. I kept my head out of the water enough to see that boat driver seemed not to give a fck at all, he was not even looking at me. I thought I was going to die but as I was totally hopeless, the boat came back and the driver saved me. He said I was right to trust him and he thanked me for it.

We arrived at a harbor and we walked in the city until the day came up. He explained there was a tram that could take me home. The tram arrived and when I was about to get in, he told me he wasn't coming with me. He said ""It is your home, not mine"". He said I was pretty, I smiled and then he noticed my extra tooth was broken in two part. He advised me to have it cut into two small teeth replace the ones I lost. The tram moved away and I woke up.

Well, the end. I don't know what it is supposed to mean. I often dream about my father or about my teeth, sometimes both. In real life I have normal teeth and I don't remember my father a lot (we were not very close and he died a long time ago). So the ""paternal figure"" is abstract to me. I never really experienced abuses neither.

He turns and looks up and yells “what a wonderful sound!” I look up and see a girl in the window. An ingenue; stunningly beautiful. The setting sun lights her face in a pink and orange glow. 

“Tony! I’ll see you soon, you’re the only thing I see!” She calls out. 

I realize it’s the 1950’s. Guess where this is going?

569,Ghost Tarot Card Dream,1,deih5h,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/deih5h/ghost_tarot_card_dream/,0,"   In the dream I find a box of tarot cards, my first reaction is ""Free tarot deck, sweet!"". This goes about as well as you'd think.


   I keep getting the Three of Swords every time. For people who don't mess with tarot  cards a lot three of swords means heartbreak and emotional pain. I'm thoroughly spooked so I throw the deck out the window. Only to have it reappear in my pocket. I try every way I can think of to get rid of it (burning, burial, ect.) But it always reappears.


   At this point I've almost gave up  but while I'm looking through the pictures I've taken with my phone I see one from the night I found the tarot card, with a ghost girl in the background. She looked kinda like the girl from The Ring but she was impossibly pale and had teeth that resembled a sharks that barely fit in her mouth.


   I do some research and somehow I find out what happened to the girl. She was from a wealthy family and her parents were getting a divorce. 


   The lawyer said that the Dad stood to gain a lot of money by losing custody. Don't ask me how that works because I have no clue. The Mom ends up dying before she can get custody, so either the Dad or the lawyer drowns the girl because she doesn't have a use anymore.

At first the dream was realistic, with the news just frantically proclaiming a meteor destined to hit earth was on its way within the day. My family reacted as you would expect but they weren't the focus. Strangely I was sent to school one last time, but as I was with my friends I felt I strong, godlike feeling inside me as sadness as confusion washed over me. My friend asked me, ""do you believe in heaven? Like a afterlife after the meteor hits."" I didn't answer as I got lost in my thoughts. I was absolutely terrified of nothing after death. Just ceasing to exist terrifies me and no after life would suck ass. I'm  thinking about how if I died, what would happen if there was a afterlife. Were the Greeks right? Christians? Hindus couldn't be right if I was just reborn into a fiery hellish Earth. Maybe god sent a asteroid because he got bored of Humans. ""Yeah y'all can go to heaven I have a new idea. I call them Godlings and unlike some shitty humans, they all WORSHIP me."" After my hours of thinking, Me, being a clout chasing 8th grader that  even while facing death ignored the unpopular kids that I was friends with many years before and hanged out with the popular kids like a little shit. When I got home my dream started bending reality. I was selected to go through a bridge to another planet that had appeared. A holy bridge that just appeared, for some reason it didn't faze nor confuse me,  I just said. ""Oh i'll survive."" Of course this dream brought out the true instincts of survival inside me. I care and love my family but they were forcefully pushed back in the list of priorities inside my mind. I ran through the bridge not looking back, it was only a few 100 meters long but it was sort of a magic portal to a safe, beautiful world. I fell out through the air and landed on the ground unscathed, I wondered if this was just how I traveled into the afterlife. That the meteor had already hit and this was the way to reach the afterlife. I naturally grouped up with all my friends who had been on the bridge with me. We looked around and had a sudden aggression towards a group of ""unpopular"" kids. We were assholes, and chased them on magical boats through the water while feeling a constant holy divine presence watching over us. The most vivid part was when me and an acquaintance fell through a water fall. The fall was a couple 100 meters but I remember just having instructions on how to ""protect"" myself from the fall just, appear, inside my mind. We all forget about the chase and start walking until we find houses, and get to choose where we live. We all ""saw"" a holy presence which was actually a voice in our minds with a shining light always in the corner of our eye. It offered us homes. When I selected my house I jolted awake, still thinking that the asteroid was on its way. I sat awake for another hour thinking about how vivid it was. I feel that same presence at times whenever I'm not around things such as electronics or anything that requires my full attention. I don't know how I feel about death after that dream. I feel like that dream was put there by somebody. Something silly in that dream was that the first thing I did after finding out about the meteor, I snapped my ""crush"" that I ""loved"" her. I didn't look at the response and immediately brushed it off. The strange thing was that I wasn't really attracted to her before the dream but my feelings for her have grown a lot within a couple hours. This dream has freaked me out and I needed write about it to get it off my chest. If you made it this far, thanks for reading!",1570449100.0

Unfortunately, the customs official couldn't speak English, or so I thought. He was getting angrier and angrier, then I realised all his colleagues were laughing - he was deliberately pretending not to understand me.

Then they gave me a series of complicated immigration forms to complete - things that played on tropes of British people - like I had to sign a form to say I'd never been involved in a fox hunt, and that I'd been to a dentist. The whole time all the Dutch customs officials were laughing.

Then a female customs official came over and started another thing, but whispered to me ""just go along with it, it's part of the Brexit deal, it's easier if you just let them laugh"".

581,A Semi-Lucid Nightmare. Can't Kill Myself In Dreams Anymore and The Monsters Know.,2,deeya2,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/deeya2/a_semilucid_nightmare_cant_kill_myself_in_dreams/,1,"In the beginning I was a famous magician who was lying about their magic powers. I was in a rush to get home to my apartment building, but I was in front of a red light. I called out to this random cop to get him to escort me but by the time he came over light had already turned green. He kept fangirling over me and I tried to tell him that my magic wasn’t actually real, but he didn’t believe me.

*I woke up and went back to sleep. I guess my mind didn’t like that….*

Because suddenly I was high up in an apartment building on one of the top floors, I was trying to hide behind stacks of grey chairs (the ones used in assembly at my primary school). I knew she would find me here, but there was nowhere else to hide! She entered the room and started talking about how ‘all she has been trying to do is protect me,’ (it was the other mother from Caroline, full monster form. Eight limbs all made of needles, cracked skin, just generally bloody terrifying). She was getting closer, I could hear the consistant sharp taps of her steps on the wooden floor. She was almost crawling, using all of her limbs and moving similar to a spider. Fucking Terrifying. Her head was whipping back and forth, frantically scanning the room. 

Inevitably she saw me. She started slamming the stacks of chairs in front of me and soon I was standing in the middle of a hallway. The rows of chairs created the walls taller than me and she crawled beneath them then stood at her full height right in front of me. Too close. I- I didn’t want to hear any more of the horrific things she had to say, I didn't want this, I want to wake up, so I turned to the wall behind me and threw myself out the window. Somehow, I knew it wouldn’t kill me, I knew this wasn’t real, *just a dream, just a dream, just a dream, not real, cant hurt, just a dream*.

As I was falling through the air she was still saying something about how ‘she had been drugging me for a while, but they tested my blood and it’s not the drugs affecting me, it’s something already in my blood, a part of me, that’s fucking me up.’ I saw straight into her beady, black eyes (not buttons, solid black) as she said it, although I was still falling I could clearly see her face. Her face was sunken and pale, she had huge black ovals around both eyes that covered almost half her face. Her voice was loud and clear as I plummeted, I could hear it all running through my mind as I fell, I could see her face and those dead eyes digging away at my soul. I wanted this to be over, I could see the ground getting closer…

 ...but I never hit it. I immediately, suddenly, reappeared directly in front of her, closer than before, she had moved closer. She hadn’t panicked at all, like she knew exactly what would happen. She said that all they’re concerned about is protecting me but that’s not fair, and she mentioned some of my family and friends but I cant recall exactly what she said about them. She kept moving closer and closer, I didn’t know what she was going to do but, as those needle fingers stretched towards me, I was terrified to find out. 

*So I woke myself up.*

*This, I think, was the first dream I noticed that I couldn't kill myself - and believing that this is true has made it so. Since this dream if I ever kill myself to end a dream I (ususally) respawn at the last place I touched, like a videogame. Once I even switched consciousness with a bunch of people, like a lego game, to get away from a flying allegator.... Luckily, my brain will ususally let me bail out when there is no other way out.*

585,The Gentle Fool,1,deg4pe,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/deg4pe/the_gentle_fool/,0,"I had a really weird dream that took a surprisingly sharp turn just now. 

I was on top of a hill with a bunch of ""classmates,"" talking to our teacher. It was a kind of sombre setting, as this seemed like some kind of after school, extra credit thing. And I say ""classmates"" because everyone was in very different age groups. I had an assignment due soon and I was preparing how to write it but I couldn't think of a subject, when my teacher suggested I do it on the ""underworld."" A mysterious cave system down by the beach. He was discussing with another student, who was saying it was really dangerous, but then a third student who couldn't have been more than 10 really wanted to check it out. I was trying to start my essay but I kept rewriting the first sentence over and over again and was struggling with writers block. 

At one point the kid said he was going and I decided to go with him to keep an eye on him and make sure nothing happened. As we were walking down towards the beach you could hear the other kid freaking out in the background almost hysterically about how dangerous it was. 

As we walked along the beach, we approached an opening in the side of the hill. Not knowing what to expect, the mood completely changed as we entered the cave. Immediately a saw a bunch of kids standing in the middle of a large chamber looking up in aw at these weird waterfall like pillars lining the walls. The kid said they were calcium pillars. As we walked the gravity in the room changed. Its like we were nearly weightless, making it difficult to walk or move quickly. Another group of kids were standing in the middle looking around in aw, but I quickly realized they weren't the only... entities there.  

I looked up and saw a iron chair with restraints on it and one of the kids strapping himself in. He seemed to be in some kind of a trance. As my eyes adjusted, I realized that there were more compartments, and I made my way up a ledge in order to see into one of the other compartments. There were slabs with what appeared to be bodies restrained to them. Except they weren't kids, they seemed to be dried husks that were glowing and blue.

I saw another chamber opposite to the entrance with stairs leading down it. But as I approached it, I heard a billowy voice exclaim ""I need sustenance,"" and I decided it was time to leave. I slowly made my way across the room and told the kid I was with that we were leaving, who was still struggling to work his way through the low gravity. As my eyes continued to adjust I saw more compartments, including pathways that seemed to continue on forever immediately on both sides of the entrance, as if this room defied the normal laws of space and time. I found that hopping on one foot at a time was the most effective way to move, pushing myself as if I was underwater. Tensions rose as we did this, and it seemed to take forever. 

As we left the cave I remember passing by a pile of beach debris covered in sand. The affects of the weird gravity still acting on me, I pushed off one of them only to realize that it was a pile of old boots that were discarded at the mouth of the cave. We worked our way back to the top of the hill, and after catching my breath, I suddenly knew exactly what to write.",1570461965.0
586,Questions about night terrors and such,1,defzjo,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/defzjo/questions_about_night_terrors_and_such/,0,"Sorry in advance for the longer post. I'm having late night can't sleep thought vomit and dream related questions:

I have always suffered from night terrors, sleep walking, and waking nightmares. They have always felt extremely real, been what I can only describe as ""evil"", terrifying, and usually gory, to the point where I went to therapy for them. I wake up screaming, I've left my hotel room in the middle of the night because I sleepwalked right out the door, I accidentally kicked my husband in the chest because I thought I was fighting off a killer, and usually experience utter terror with them. I have had no trauma, other than what comes with being raised in a fundamental Christian School and church, and have no real reason to explain them. My therapist told me there isn't an obvious underlying cause for me to have them (they're pretty much only caused by early childhood trauma) other than I just have a fabulous imagination. On top of those, I have 2 other types of dreams: ones that are the regular typical silly dream type and involve what has happened in my daily life, and ones that involve things, places, and people I've never seen before. The latter of them are extremely vivid. They don't seem like dreams, more like memories and they stick with me. For example, in one of them I was following someone around the corner of some type of roughly carved stairway leading down with torches on the wall. I can still feel the cool, rough stone under my hand as I touched it.

Though my having a fabulous imagination is totally plausible, I've always had this nagging itch of a feeling that it's more than that. Like maybe that I'm more sensitive to the darker things in the universe, I'm astral projecting in my sleep, or something similar. As for the memory like type dreams, I am leaning towards these being past life memory blips as there's no way those are dreams. They feel more real than some of my memories from last week. 


My questions are:
1. Could my night terrors, sleep walking, and waking dreams be something else besides my wonderful imagination? If so, what do you think they are and how should I deal/manage them?

2. If my memory-like dreams are in fact from a past life, how do I learn more about it?",1570460895.0

I watched a YouTube video recently on parallel universes when a segment of it featured a man who had a dream he had been married to the love of his life for ten years, literally lived a daily life including Nature's necessities, going to bed and waking in the morning, but one day reality began to warp and he eventually experienced excruciating pain--at which point he woke in a hospital bed from a 30 day coma after a vehicle accident.

I remembered a dream I had last year and forgot. I had married a woman with light brown hair she often wore in a ponytail. She was maybe 5'8"", Caucasian, she liked to wear jeans, dark blue shoes with white soles, and a burgandy sweater was her favorite because it kept her from being cold, it was like wearing a blanket incognito. She liked to window shop, she didn't care for eating out, and she loved movies and to read, but her taste varied. We were together for months. I didn't experience it in real time, I experienced snippets, like 30 seconds here, a few minutes there, an hour, nothing more, but the moments spanned several months at least. I knew her name, I met her parents (they liked me). She had no siblings. I can't remember her name, though, but I can see her in my mind clearly, and there is no one from my waking world that could have inspired the creation of this woman. She was NOT a dream character. She was real. At one point, we were going to bed and I was just staring at her. She asked what was wrong and I told her I didn't want to go to sleep because I was afraid that if I did I would never wake up there again, that I would never see her again or be able to find her. She laughed and told me how silly that was, and that she was not going anywhere. I went to sleep there and woke up here. It was jarring, I've never experienced anything like that before. I mourned losing her like I had lost a family member, until I fell asleep again and forgot about her. Just like I told her I would.

I've not seen her since, but now that I remember her, I can try to find her. Maybe. Dreams are tricky, even though I'm not exactly sure that was a dream at all.",1570401275.0

Something happened in the past, and now there are only a few kilometer long islands. Everything else is covered in water, and it's absolute anarchy. No laws or rules, and free for all. It's always night amd it's always raining, not thunder or storm, just light rain. I'm on one island, a cargo island I think. I'm in a storage garage looking thing, full of those red, metal containers, huge ones. There is a red, metal 'bridge' connecting that island to another island, and it feels like my family is there, I never get to see them tho, I just feel it, they're there and I want to get there. I clearly remember the bridge being called the Victoria Bridge, it's an older red bridge, but it's not really a bridge you drive a car on to get from one place to another, it's more like a sliding bridge, there is a device you have to strap yourself in, and slide across. I've never gotten to the destination island, so no idea what's actually there or how it looks like. I also met with other people on the cargo island, I didn't know them, but they wanted to get on the Victoria Bridge as well. It all feels off tho, almost like a reality. And the weird thing is, it makes me incredibly calm being there. Every time I went to sleep the last 3-4 days, I went back there, and I've never felt so relaxed, calm and comfortable while awake, ever in my life. Does anyone have any idea what thia could potentially mean? If not, I just wanted to share it, because I... Don't actually know.

I walked through the destroyed city and found a house, where I discovered a house full of people, all of them with darker skins and deep blue eyes, a lot of them older people and some that were younger, they all looked at me as if I was a threat. 

I went and told them that I'm only here to help at which they just continued staring at me, and said that ""We just want to survive,""

I'll use last night as an example. I dreamed there was some sort of natural disaster.

I was going through my things, packing some odd set of candles, removing money from my scrapbook, packing clothes.

So I have this recurring motif in many of my dreams (lately it has been in almost every single one). I can dream about anything, usually mixture of memories and thoughts of the previous day, but it always ends the same - I want to get home from wherever I am but miss the last bus/train/plane home. Sometimes I am with someone, with whom I dreamed about, but usually it's just me.

These are some of my findings:

*  I always try to get home, very rarely a different destination. 
* I always miss the LAST bus, so there is usually no way to get home, as I don't own a car. 
* It is always dark outside, all of the sudden it gets dark and I know I should get home, but don't know how.
* I try to think of ways how to get home - hitchhiking, walking, trying to find different means of transport (JUST GET ME HOME kind of thoughts)
* I never reach home I ALWAYS wake up before I can figure out how to get there.
* I usually have this feeling of fear of the unknown,  anxious thoughts of being left somewhere, but sometimes filled with optimistic feeling of trying new things - like since I am bound to stay outside (till the first bus comes) I can think of new things to do during the night.

What do you think? I usually understand my dreams well, but this strange theme is so repetitive, that I really think it has some kind of importance.",1570404781.0
616,Sinking: Open to Interpretation,1,debm7n,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/debm7n/sinking_open_to_interpretation/,0,"I sat on a tiny boat in the middle of the sea. It was nice out, the sun way up ahead and a light ocean breeze flowing through my hair. I could see for miles, no land in sight. Just blue, blue from the sky and the ocean, forming an endless landscape everywhere you looked. There were no birds, no fish, no life other than me. I was alone. I looked around for a few minutes, until the warm sun mixed with the cooling salty breeze convinced me to sleep.


I slept for I don't know how long. Long enough for the sun to fall considerably, so a sunset was touching the water, turning a slice of the horizon in front of me into liquid gold. Small waves licked the side of my boat, rocking it gently. An anchor lying on the floor of the boat shined in the perfect angle of sunlight. I stared at it, staring at the white glint that reflected off of it. I felt a shiver as I finally looked up again, to see that clouds had gathered in the sky, leaving darkness. The sun had retreated beyond the horizon. All that was left was water and dark skies.


It was beginning to get colder.


The clouds had darkened and became more threatening, looming above me. Finally it came: a crack of thunder, and a single bolt of lightning that arched across the heavens. As soon as that happened, the sky opened up and let out a torrent larger than any I had ever heard of. The rain fell in sheets, heavy and fast. Waves started appearing, beginning at just a few feet tall, but growing quickly. What started as harmless waves turned into walls of water the size of buildings, as big as 70 feet tall. There was no way my boat would be able to handle the damage that would be caused if I was hit. 


After what felt like hours of waiting, a wave finally crashed into my vessel, and it immediately collapsed on itself. I sank. Deeper, deeper, deeper still, until I was sure that I was miles under the water. Lightning continued to crash overhead, occasionally illuminating the area around me.


The water was cold and dark. The water filled my ears, making my surroundings completely silent. I was in an endless expanse of water. Somehow I wasn't suffocating. Or was I just not breathing? I'm not sure. All I knew was that I was sinking into what felt like a depth that would go on forever. I stared up towards the surface of the water that I had once been floating on. The wreckage of my tiny ship was nowhere to be seen. I lost hope. I stopped thinking, stopped feeling. I let myself fall.


There was another crack of lightning. I was suddenly aware of every inch of my body. Something was wrong. The water got colder suddenly. I closed my eyes and counted to ten. I opened them again. Dark. I could see nothing. My eyes shut again. I count to ten. Open. Another flash of lightning.


But this time, I see the silhouette of some massive serpentine creature.",1570435280.0

I've had a series of weather or disaster related dreams where the mechanics of the weather and such hinged on paperwork. 

One dream had a this huge tornado in the distance that kept coming closer. I found a line of people and was yelling at them that there was a tornado and to seek shelter. An official came by and said to calm down, this is a scheduled tornado, and it will wait till everyone is done with the paperwork before it would come through. When you filled out the paperwork, you were then taken to the shelter via bulldozer. Sure enough, the tornado stopped progressing and waited for everyone to finish up and didn't start destroying things again until it was given the go ahead.

The other dream I remember well had a requirement that you needed a passport to switch seasons. If you didn't have one, you would be stuck in whatever season you were in. You could pay to skip seasons as well if you didn't like one, you just needed the fee and the appropriate paperwork. All seasons existed in slightly separated dimensions, but you could still see other people experiencing them.

Once we went inside it looked nice and very inviting and it was very nice and there was a lot of couches and chairs and the front desk looked like a ticket stand like at a resort and it was made of wood and stuff and it looked like someone’s else’s home and like a bookshelf where all the products were being stored but we were at a store and someone’s house at the same time. 

There was some people there but not a lot. 

I was looking around a lot since I was interested in the place until I looked over and I saw mom and dad with his friend Mike, my moms friend Effie, and Nina with Donovan and them signing forms on a  little bar with a white woman at the desk who acted very condescending and very loudmouthed and was acting like I was a child saying stuff like, “Now remember young man! Do not!” when I asked her what was going on with my family. There was also a sign at the ticket stand front desk on the ramp saying, “Stay in here and shop with us and think about what you’ve done young man!” 

I went over to them and ask them what they were doing and they said they were bored and they were leaving but they had to sign a bunch of papers and have a buddy with them before they could which even though was easy to do it was completely tedious and I remember I was scared thinking it was gonna apply to me and the woman said to me in a very condescending but playful tone  that I could only have one buddy per person and one form per person.

Basically I was looking around the store while parents waited for me and pretty soon then I got bored and wanted to leave and they said I needed a buddy and to go find one and so I did and I used another copy of Effie as my buddy and once I got up there I was handed a book which had the form in it but they said that hat was just the brochure and I had a hard time trying to find out which one was which until I eventually found the form until they told me that that wasn’t the real form and then pretty soon they gave me a new one

I asked them, “Who do you think you are!” And they said, “We get that l the time. We wanna make friends. Have experiences. We want to create new friends for you.” And all I said was is, “All you’re creating is nothing but pain and kidnapping!” And I just remember reaching out for my phone trying to call the police but my phone wouldn’t work. 

Also I remember I was signing the real form with the help of the man at the front desk which looked like a ticket stand and I just remember it was a children’s test with pictures on it before I actually could sign the form and the first question was, “What City is this? It’s a place with parties, girls, and entertainment!” And it was a shilouette if a city which was Vegas and I obviously said so and then the man said, “Ah ah ah! Look at the city. Does it look like anything to you? No fair. Keep going!” And I tried telling him it’s Vegas cause it was completely obvious that it was. And I just remember the form got bigger and bigger and they said it was for emailing purposes and I just tried signing the form and scribbling not thinking about anything and trying to slap the man and the woman but they caught my slap before I could do anything and took my phone and threw it behind their desks and then I tried getting out myself of the place and I grabbed my phone and they blocking the way from where the exit was and saying, “Off-limits mister! Finish your waiver!”

627,Sequence of three movie-like dreams in which I was other people,2,de4f79,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/de4f79/sequence_of_three_movielike_dreams_in_which_i_was/,0,"1) I dreamed I was sleeping and in that inner dream I was a black bald young american guy who was fat, tall, happy, simple, very calm and somewhat dumb. The black young fat me worked as a private van driver. I was walking around inside a very stereotypical american suburban house, and somehow I knew my life was a very stereotypical bullshit TV show. I was happy because I was about to get married but I didn't know who the bride was. All I knew is that she was black and beautiful. But I didn't find that weird because I was not a real person and I knew that. I was a fictional TV character and my thoughts and feelings were not controlled by myself (like that movie ""death and taxes""). There were some random black people walking around that house too, but I can't remember if we talked. Then I ""woke up"" and googled ""dream meaning black guy about to get married"" in my mobile phone. My hand was white, so in this outer dream I was white. I found out it was a multi-level dream because the results were nonsense words that didn't form sentences. The only thing is that the word ""NOW"" appeared like every four words capitalised and in italic. The inner dream was in third person (I see myself walking around) and the outer dream was in first person. First person is unusual for me.

\-----

2) There were two guys talking. They were both black. One was mid-age with some grey hair and a moustache and the other was old and looked like B. B. King at 85 years old (almost moustache left). The camera kept switching between them like a dialogue in a movie. The weird thing is that I was both of them, I knew that and each one of me's had separate thoughts. Like if I used a time-machine to go to the future ask advice to my old self (not the other way around because I felt like I was primarily the mid-age one). We were sit in comfortable leather chairs in a quiet large room talking about how wonderful it is to have internet and be able to learn anything we want, despite not having enough time in life to learn everything there is to learn. Very pleasant dream. Again, why was I black and this time not fat nor bald?

\-----

3) This one was mind-blowing. I was a fat Italian guy with a very hot blonde wife who looked like a porn star with fake boobs, but she was actually a good woman and I was the scum. She was telling me she was pregnant, without any emotion and I was also not even listening to her. Suddenly the movie cut to a porn clip were I was f\*\*\*ing her in an acrobatic position, which was hilarious because my belly was huge. Then I remembered I had had a vasectomy shortly before that and she didn't knew, so she had to be cheating on me and that was weird because I was supposed to be the scum, not her. But here is where it gets really interesting:

the Italian me looked at the screen of the movie, breaking the fourth wall, and in that moment he realised he was in a movie because an alternate version of me popped into existence in the other side, and the camera backed away showing the Italian me and our wife in a big screen. Both me's didn't know how the one who just popped into existence looked like, but we both knew the alternate me was the father of the baby because we knew that right after watching the movie that alternate me would go inside the movie but back in time and change the chain of events so he would be the one f\*\*\*ing our wife in our collective memory. So together we would hack the chain of events so that our wife still cheats on us but with ourselves.

Both me's grinned at each other as if the Italian knew where the eyes of the alternate me were. We were satisfied because the alternate me, while back in the past in the reality of the Italian me, had also secretly moved all assets of the Italian me out of american jurisdiction and had hidden a plane ticket in the suit the Italian me was wearing. The alternate me ceased to exist when the Italian me felt the plane ticket appear in his pocket. The flight was scheduled to a few hours after that moment.

The Italian me was going to disappear and leave our clueless disloyal wife with nothing but a kid that wouldn't look like the Italian me nor have his DNA but would still pass on her beauty as well as my intelligence (which I didn't think I had in the beginning of the dream). A bittersweet punishment for the disloyal good woman who wanted to have a kid brighter than herself.

We take off and my heart falls to my stomach and I’m scared and feeling like I’m going to throw up, the whole time watching out a window as my view goes from ground level on earth straight up to space. R reaches up to take my hand and tell me some sweet comforting things because he likes me and he’s done this before. 
We are only in space briefly before we come back down to earth and “dock” in the back of an old family video in town. We part ways and as I’m walking home, there are kids playing and I see a guy walking, appearing disoriented. As he gets closer, I realize he is3D but he looks “fuzzy” .

I watched a horror movie called ""Midsommar"" on the same night and it probably influenced this dream.

I just woke up and took notes from what I felt from the dream so I wouldn't forget about it. Don't mind if it's too weird. These are the first words I could describe from it:

""I was in a haunted house.

And there was blood in that house. And guts. Of who's I don't know. 

And there was evil.

But I didn't believe in evil. Neither was afraid of it.

And a black cat appeared, carrying a knife. It hid, but I could still see the knife. And a voice told me it was the devil. 

I didn't believe in the voice. So the voice told me to go to the cat and ask him if he was the devil. And then to ask him the secrets of the world.

I think that voice was me.

And then I came after the black cat, which tried to attack me with the knife. But I could easily handle it. 

The cat ran, and I was led to a mirror.

In the mirror, I looked at myself and called for the devil. He didn't appear to me.

And I asked, ""Why are there secrets to the world?"" 

The face, which was mine, got possessed by the devil. The eyes turned to white and the mouth was smiling widely, reaching my ears, showing up big teeth. 

He said, ""because I want to"".

In another mirror, figures appeared. Religious folklore figures passed by the mirror. The history of a church. However, that history told by the mirror was in backward. From the present church to its beginnings.

And that was scary.

Later we found wounded people in the sea. A man and two women. The man had his leg broken, with an exposed bone, his head was bloody, his eyes were red, his skin was pale white and his belly was cut open and his guts were coming out of it. The women were also pale and bloody, with wounds in the ear and neck. But there was a lot of mysterious blood on their clothes from an unknown wound.  

I think those wounded people and the backward gospel were both secrets of the world""",1570400631.0

That’s pretty much the gist of everything that happens. Sometimes it’s a different window, sometimes it’s a different family member. Sometimes it’s two faces instead of one. I don’t exactly know why this has haunted me for over a decade, but last night was the most recent occurrence of the dream.

They say, it is the dream where you know you are in a dream and you have the ability to control it.
Sounds pretty awesome right?

I researched more, about how to get there...
Few of them were :
1. Having a dream journal
2. Asking yourself everytime, if you are in a dream and checking it normally as well, so once it becomes a habit, you will do it in Ur dreams as well and will realise that it actually is a dream(sounds confusing but they say it works)

# The Cornfield 

The freeway was cold the wind I could feel bristle in my hair. The dark cold night was not lit with bright sparkling stars instead I could see grey clouds following me. I poked my thumbs on the screen of my phone waiting for texts to pop through the ding sound reassured me every time it occurred it felt comfortable. 

I was weary and I was cold. My jacket didn’t keep my warm and neither did my scarf. I tightened it up for the third time as my cold breath could be seen like a puff of white smoke leaving my lips. 

I tilted my head downwards to stare at the blank black screen of my phone as I kept poking at it. 

Once I was done I slid the phone back in my pocket and left my hand in there as if it would be taken away. 

My other hand was tilting my hat down to my forehead to hide it. I started to walk down the freeway again I had no reason to wait here, not a single soul would drive down this dead forsaken road. 

But here I am walking down this road the very road no one would dare to cross. I kept my fingers laced on my hat while my hair flew about in the wind. 

Having the entire road to myself I felt almost free but I still felt out of place walking here. 

There was nowhere else to go to not a city in sight or a town or a pub. Nothing. Just a long stretching road covered in dirt.

The further I walked out the worse my phones reception got and when it did go out I turned it off and was left with the cold darkness of the night around me.

I stood there in the middle of the road, in the middle of the dark. Nothing to be of any light and nothing to be of any guidance to any kind of civilization. 

Here I was on this road alone, yet a flash of light could be seen in the distance I peered down the road to see the flash of light which was moving down this very lonesome road.

I blinked several times to see if my mind was playing tricks on me, but there it is a flash of light moving on the road coming close to me.

When it came in to view yet so far away I could see the shape of a car. A car I thought?

When do cars ever drive on this forsaken closed off-road?

In fact, why did I even start walking on this road?

To be honest, I can’t answer that question myself.

So I blink at the car’s lights and I wonder if it was intentional but the headlights of the car blinked as well.

I couldn’t tell if the headlights actually blinked or if the driver just turned the lights on and off.

If it was an actually blink I may have gone mad.

Anyway, I was watching the car driving down this road for what seemed like an hour when it started to slow down as it came towards me.

Once the car had stopped right in front of me the lights were so bright I had to pull my hat down across my eyes to block the light out.

I heard the engine reeve for a moment and the sound of the door opening. Once I heard the door slam shut everything went pitch black until whoever was driving the car moved my hat back on my head.

I stepped back as I blinked for a moment. 

The person driving the car was wearing nothing but black and had a chainsaw for a hand. I held my hands up in defence and wanted to walk away but I was frozen in place.

“Who wha? Are you?” I asked but It felt like I had no idea how to speak.

The man I hoped was looking at me because he wore a mask on his face, I couldn’t tell if it was the Friday the 13th mask or some fictional mad man villain I had created somewhere else.

The man pointed his chainsaw hand at me and the sound of it-I just wanted to get the hell away from this guy than worry about the sound of the chainsaw so instead of listening to the chainsaw I sprinted for my life as if it was some kind of anime opening.

As I ran I kept turning my head back down this endless dark forsaken road to see the car was following me. 

Of course, it was, I mean why wouldn’t it? Right?

I kept sprinting down this road back to where I started instead of where I wanted to go. But I didn’t know where I was going in the first place so that could have been anywhere.

Yet the car was still following with the man with the chainsaw hand and the strange mask.

No sign of life still just an empty road, well except for me and the evil man driving in the car.

However.

In Fact, I mean, however.

The road that was supposed to be behind me before the man in the car that's now chasing me down this road I walked down earlier was no longer the same.

I was now running down a cornfield.

Great.

Of all places, it had to be a cornfield.

I checked my six to see if the man in the car was following and to my happy surprise he was not.

I had to wonder how far did I go off track to be at a cornfield and no longer have the man in the car following me?

It messed me up a fair bit.

So I decided to have a look around and yep to my conclusion it was a cornfield.

Now since I was chased by a man in a car and who had a chainsaw hand I had two options one I go in the cornfield and see where it takes me or two I find the road again and find civilization.

My last option which I decided not to include beforehand because that's was the option I picked.

I stood here. 

I stood right in front of the cornfield with the road behind me that seemed to end where the grass met and the border of the cornfield surrounded it.

Why was a road put here I wouldn’t have a clue.

So I stood there.

I kicked my feet on the ground as I stood there not moving a muscle forward or backwards or left or right.

Yet I saw the corn in the cornfield begin to shake and move in the wind. Not all of them only 3.

Yep, 3.

So I tilted my head to the right to get a closer look (Well it was not objectively as close as I wanted to be but it’s as staying in one spot good) and yes I saw the corn move.

Then I saw three heads pop out of the corns as if they too were running from something.

I stepped back yet again, this time breaking the rule I had in place which was never moving from this spot.

Damn it I thought.

Well since I moved from this spot I might as well wave at the people in the corn.

I waved at them. 

They waved back.

We all stared at each other not even sure what to do. Until the three people got out of the corn wearing winter clothing the same as me except one of them was wearing a dress and no scarf. 

All three of them started beckoning me to follow them so for a moment I did, I walked over towards them hiding in the corn.

But before I could even cross over I banged my knee on a fence. 

I could clearly see the corn wedged in between the fence as if the corn was grown on the fence itself.

So I decided to walk away from the fence while the three people were clearly trying to get my attention I shrugged my shoulders.

“You need to hide, the killer on the loose,” One of them said while as if their body danced like a mime.

I looked back and forth and thought to myself maybe my odds of survival were better elsewhere.

I mean it a cornfield right? Right?

At this point, I stood there again and said nothing and did nothing. 

So I went oh well and headed out to the highway once more.

But wait, how I can even go back on the highway when I was clearly at a cornfield for one moment?

At this point, I don’t even question what going because everything changing so quickly it ridiculous and I can’t even care.

So now I’m back on the highway after I watched the three strange people hop themselves back into the cornfield possibly to there deaths.

As I trudge down this lonely highway I decided not to think about anything on my way down.

Quite frankly there was not much to think about at all.

But I felt like my walk on the highway was over, as I felt my entire body sink into through the highway and the world began to change like a pop-up book returning me home.

I fell back on my couch to relax knowing the day was over but I turned my head to my right to see three strange-looking clones of myself all sitting cramped on the one part of the couch.

In Fact, they kind of reminded me of Keanu Reeves and Ron's Rat?

646,Dream of walking aimlessly,2,de1s0o,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/de1s0o/dream_of_walking_aimlessly/,0,"I had a very pleasant little dream last night, and thought i would share

It all started with me in the middle of walking down a gravel road in the middle of two farm fields which where skirted by the forest. Seemingly in the middle of no where. I could feel the cool breeze, and noticed the beautifully clear sky. Jogging down the road I found that I didn't tire at all. Slowing down to a walk as pickup truck passed down the road coming from the tree line ahead. 


Walking down the gravel road and around the corner through the tree line i could see that the road ended at a small farm just on the other side. Turning around i walked back through the tree line and off the road to follow the trees for a moment, before walking through the tree line to go through the far side of the yard that sat in front of the house. Almost like i was worried about running into someone. Making it to the far side of the yard there was a creek which a rather odd stone bridge crossing it. 


Making it to the other side there was another small portion of the yard before it was yet again cut off by a creek. Stopping for a moment i wondered how i was going to cross this one seeing as it had no bridge. A log which laid halfway across the creek had caught my eye tho. Sprinting across the log to the end. I leapt across the remainder of the water, Grabbing a hold of the bank to pull myself up onto it. 


Standing up on the other side i glanced out at the open fields ahead. There where rolling hills for as far as the eye could see
bordered on one side by a shear cliff and a what looked like a ocean. It was all remarkably beautiful, and calm, But unfortunately that was where the dream ended. If only i could go back to it",1570388187.0
647,A sad dream,4,ddz4vr,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/ddz4vr/a_sad_dream/,3,"Last night, I had the 2nd saddest dream of my entire life. 

I’ll share a bit of background info to set it up because storytelling is not my forte. I’m a shy but fun-loving 39 yr old woman with an amazing husband and 2 wonderful kids. My husband is a classic extrovert. He’s smart, funny, and very easygoing. Nothing ever seems to bother him too much. We have a tight-knit circle of close friends and we’re both blessed to have lots of extended family nearby. I’m a social worker / school-based mental health therapist. I work with at-risk urban youth and I absolutely love my job. 

Life is really great. Better than I ever imagined. But I struggle with generalized anxiety disorder and PTSD due to childhood trauma. I occasionally ruminate about unrealistic worries. Over the years, I’ve adopted lots of helpful coping skills, but all that I’ve learned is totally useless when I’m asleep, lol.

I hope no one makes fun of me or picks apart my grammar, but it’s a risk I’m willing to take in order to get this off my chest (and hopefully out of my brain), since I’d rather not share this dream with people I know (not counting my husband, because I tell him everything). Ok, here goes.

I dreamed I was driving home alone after having been out with my mom and my 23 yr old little sister for several hours at a fun family event. My husband had unfortunately worked late and wasn’t able to make it on time, but I had been expecting him to swing by whenever he could. Our 2 young kids were with him; idk why. Well, he never did show up, so I was disappointed and a little annoyed.

When I got home, there were like 200 people inside my house having a massive party. It was like something out of a movie. People were packed in almost shoulder to shoulder. The music was loud and distorted like the speakers were blown, but it was somehow soft and inviting at the same time. The song that was playing was slow and romantic. It felt familiar. A handful of couples were dancing, some people were mingling, but most people were just sitting around talking. Everyone was drunk.

I could barely see through the smoky haze, but I noticed right away that some of the pictures on the wall had been knocked crooked, there was a broken vase with its water and flowers spilled out onto the coffee table, and there were more than a few empty bottles and cans strewn around the room.

As I looked around, I was struck by one couple in particular, whom I did not know. They were slow dancing together and the lady’s eyes were closed, her head resting lovingly on her man’s chest as they swayed back and forth. It was a beautiful thing to see this couple in such a warm embrace, so at peace in each other’s arms that they seemed oblivious to the noise and chaos around them. I was transfixed for a moment, but then some guy off to the side somewhere laughed heartily and I snapped back into the confusing reality of the whole scene. I was like, what the hell?? I wasn’t mad, just bewildered.

I squeezed my way through all the people, looking for my husband. I found him outside on the back deck, laughing and talking with some of our friends and neighbors. Out in the yard, there was an awesome bonfire going and probably 50 more people milling around. Everyone was having a good time. 

I asked my husband what the heck was going on and he said he had been too tired after work to meet up with me, so he went home and had a beer out on the deck. A neighbor had leaned over the fence and started chatting with him, so he invited the guy over for a quick beer. That guy told someone else, who told someone else, and word spread until entire families started showing up. The other people on the deck laughed and told me that my husband had just kept saying, “the more the merrier”, and that he hadn’t realized things had gotten so out of control inside.

I was like, ok...um, still weird, but whatever, and I decided I’d better check on our kids, who are 9 & 10. 

I pushed my way back through the people, searching for my kids. I’m short, and everyone was taller than me, so once I merged into the crowd, all I could see was the people directly surrounding me. So many torsos and feet! No one seemed to hear me repeatedly saying excuse me, no one was kindly moving aside for me, and no one inside the house even knew who I was. I was starting to feel frustrated and anxious.

I found our kids in the basement with about 25 other children all happily eating popcorn and pizza, quietly watching a movie. There were no drunkards in there with them, so that was good.

Here’s where it gets odd...

I looked up and saw 2 garlic cups stuck to the ceiling. (You know, that buttery liquid goodness that comes with pizza sometimes...) Anyway, they had been opened, so in those 2 places, the ceiling was a greasy, drippy mess. Little splotches of the stuff were soaking into the carpet.

That’s when I got mad. I stormed through the crowd, back out to my husband. I asked him how in the heck that mess happened downstairs and why wasn’t he doing a better job of watching both the kids and the drunks. He slapped his knee and only said, “Oh yeah, the garlic!” before he doubled over with laughter. He was laughing so hard he couldn’t even speak, so I left in a huff and went back downstairs to our kids. Each time I had to plow my way through that dense mass of stumbling bodies just to walk through my own home, I grew more and more irritated.

When I asked my kids about the messy ceiling, my son shrugged and said he hadn’t noticed til I pointed it out. My daughter said, “I dunno, Daddy stuck them up there with crayon wax.”

I started shoving my way through the crowd yet again, heading out to my husband for the third time, fully prepared to give him a piece of my mind... But when I reached an open space in the kitchen, I saw him through the glass patio doors and he just looked so happy that all I could think was how much I love him and how it warms my heart to see him having a nice time. I no longer cared about the garlic cups or the broken vase, etc. It was all worth it to see him smile.

But then it was like someone flipped a switch in my brain and it suddenly hit me at that moment, the stark realization that he hadn’t texted or called me at all during the past few hours and that he’d basically been having fun with the whole town except me. I was so hurt. I didn’t mind the party or begrudge him his fun, I was just devastated that I hadn’t been included. He could’ve called to say hey, there’s been a change of plans or he could’ve at least texted to give me a heads up that we had company over, or something... anything... It was like I hadn’t even crossed his mind. I thought to myself, this means I’m not his best friend like I thought I was.

I walked slowly back across the kitchen with my head down as I thought, well that’s it, I’m not his best friend and I never will be, so I have to leave him. I wanted our relationship to be everything I thought it was or nothing at all. My heart was broken.

I stopped the music and made all the guests leave. Everybody was mad at me for spoiling the fun. The adults glared at me and made snarky comments as they shuffled out. The bigger kids called me mean and the little ones cried. I felt terrible. Some people refused to leave and some were almost too drunk to move. I had to threaten to call the police to get the stragglers out. It was super stressful and the emotional turmoil of it all was physically exhausting.

And that’s it. I woke up to find that I had been crying into my pillow.

On the bright side, I think I know where almost all of it was coming from... They say dreams are the brain’s way of processing real-life events, and I believe it.

So, first of all, I’ve been craving pizza like crazy. We usually have pizza every Friday during our family movie night, but due to extenuating circumstances, we didn’t have pizza (or a movie) the past two weekends. Then yesterday, the school I work at ordered pizza for lunch, but I missed it because I had a student in crisis. Last night, we didn’t have pizza either because the kids and I went to my mom’s to celebrate my sister’s birthday. My husband worked late, as he often does, so he couldn’t go with us. I really did expect him to swing by sometime, but he didn’t. He was tired and went straight home. (No beers though, lol.)

Secondly, we have recently moved from one town to an adjacent town. My husband bowls on a league in our former town, as he has for close to 20 years now. After bowling each Wednesday, he used to grab a beer with his teammates at a local bar. Well, our move has added 15 minutes to his drive time, so although he continues to bowl there, he has stopped going to that bar. Instead, he meets up with some of his other buddies at a bar that’s like 2 minutes from our new house. For the past 3 or 4 weeks, he’s texted me from the bar saying sweet things... telling me he misses me, that we should get a babysitter sometimes so I can be there with him, and that it will be nice when the kids are old enough to stay home alone so I can join him whenever I want, etc. So I know we’re good and I have nothing to worry about, but anxiety is not a logical beast...

My biggest fear in real life is not losing him to another woman or anything else that most wives worry about. The scariest thing to me is the thought of staying married and still being deeply in love with one another but losing our friendship.

I mean, don’t get me wrong. It’s totally awesome being husband and wife, and it still blows my mind when I stop and consider that he and I have created 2 new humans as if out of thin air! It’s beyond heartwarming to know that their existence is a direct product of our love. But more so than anything else, I cherish the fact that we’re best friends on top of it all. That’s the icing on the cake.

I know full well that a relationship like ours is a rare and beautiful thing, and that we should appreciate every day we have together and never take each other for granted. And therein lies the problem. It makes my heart so full and happy that I can’t help but worry that someday, when I least expect it, something may go wrong. Like it’s too good to be true. Like the easier it is or the more perfect it all seems, the less likely it is to last.

Awake me knows though, that we’ve got a good thing going and that anxiety is a damned dirty liar. We’ve been married for 11 years now and we were together 6 years before that. (That’s how long it took me to convince myself that getting married wasn’t going to jinx us.)

So there you have it. A dream about everything and nothing all at once. A little about pizza, a little about love, and a lot about fear.

(I told my husband about this dream while he was shopping online for accessory parts for his new truck. When I finished, he smiled at me and said, “Aww, babe. You know I love you and I always want you around. You’ll always be my best friend. Look at this trailer hitch cover.” LMAO)",1570368780.0

I'm on top of the wall from Attack on Titan, and suddenly I go out and turn into a titan shifter and I destroy a bunch of trees by a pond. Next, I go back to the wall and all of my friends were titans/eaten by titans. Then, some goddess-like thing pushes all of the titans out of the land into the sea.
Skip forward a few hours irl, and there's this man. He looks into a hole going into the sea (for some reason) and I'm in the hole. He pushes me down but not intentionally. He says something along the lines of ""they come from the sea, ha"" and I'm sliding down the hole at this point. I'm scared, so in the dream I suddenly say ""I need to wake up"" and I do. Then I fall back asleep and I'm in a warehouse-type place. A guy tries to open the doors and he breaks in. Then I wake up. For good.

653,Apocalypse dream,4,ddyypi,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/ddyypi/apocalypse_dream/,0,"Last night I had a dream that everyone was getting “taken.” Like dragged away out of nowhere and disappearing. So the rest of the humans left are going kind of insane, it kind of reminded me of The Purge or Blood Diamond. All the people left have just gone nuts and are cruising around in jeeps doing horrible things. The other more sane people are just hiding. 
So I’m hiding for what feels like DAYS in this random persons closet in a house. They have a pantry in the house with non perishables in it, so I occasionally leave the closet to get some food, then go back to hide. The time comes where I need girl stuff- so I leave the house to go find my supplies.
I’m walking in the streets as quietly as possible - I’m horrified. As the houses get nicer and nicer, I find myself in a very expensive looking neighborhood. I come up to a church and peek inside a window. There are numerous dining tables set up. The place is in perfect condition. Suddenly this super dark feeling comes over me, and for some reason I KNOW this is the place where the elite, or Illuminati, is meeting during this weird time. No one enters this building because they are the leaders of everyone left here. Horrible things happen here, and I need to leave. 
Then this voice comes into my head, and I’m either having a conversation with an angel, or God himself, and he tells me- “Someone is going to come and take you now. And you need to let them.”
So then I’m walking back to the house with my closet because idk wtf I’m supposed to be doing and I’m scared. 
As predicted, this person comes up and puts a bag over my head and I pass out. 
Next thing I know, I wake up in a space ship, buckled into a seat. I’m surrounded by people in space suits. The main astronaut explains to me that they have been gathering only the “right” people, to bring them up to the new community on Mars. This is where they are taking me.
Then the space ship TAKES OFF, and I literally experience the most realistic take off possible. I’m shoved to the back of my seat, shaking for several minutes, until finally I can see out the window that Earth is under our feet. 
Then I wake up. 

I’m sure that there’s a lot of symbolism I’m supposed to be dissecting, since that dream was a play out of when God comes for all the holy people, and all of the bad people are left to try to sort themselves out- but honestly I am so impressed with my brain’s ability to create a space ship launch, and what seemed like a genuine week worth of events, even though it was probably only 90 mins.

The black girl grasped the stirring wheel so earnestly and tightly upon realizing I was her 30 something year old white male passenger.

The white girl was more oblivious and indifferent to me and I was more stressed because she was driving while texting! I don't know why I didn't say anything but I was fuming over that observation.

667,I think I believe in the afterlife from a dream,7,ddtqah,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/ddtqah/i_think_i_believe_in_the_afterlife_from_a_dream/,3,"I had a dream 6 years after a good friend’s suicide that I met up with him. We were in our early 20s when he died and it was traumatizing to say the least. It was the day I lost my innocence for sure, I was changed. Around the time we had both started dating people and had gone off on our own paths but he was someone I bonded with like a soulmate, but not romantically.  He was someone who I always needed to check on, needed to ask about and whose presence I needed even if we weren’t physically together. When he died his absence was tremendous and although it gets easier to talk about and feel, ill never be “over” it. 

One night I had a dream that we were together in a house I didn’t recognize. He came for me and told me he was ok, and that no one could have changed what happened and that he was sorry. He listened to me as I cried and held me for a while, and kissed me sweetly when he left, the way you’d comfort a close family or friend when they were grieving. I woke up and felt a release of all the grief and sobbed all the way to work, on every break and on my way home. I’m sobbing while I write this. The dream was so real that years later I really still believe we might have met up somewhere. 

I’ve never told anyone in fear of sounding crazy but the way it felt didn’t feel the same as when my dreams say what I want to hear to pacify me.    Has anyone else ever experienced this? What do you believe?",1570340176.0

I have a weird brain.",2,ddyf64,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/ddyf64/dream_number_vi_shitty_elevators_pizza_shops/,3,"My friend and I got tickets to go see a hardcore band. We were staying on the second floor of the hotel, first few times we used the elevator it was all sweet, but when I took it alone my “I support Australian seabird rescue” shirt got stuck in the bottom of the door and was being sucked in dragging me forward with it. Luckily the elevator dinged signaling it had reached the second floor, but it had only made it half way. I pulled my shirt out, but that made the elevator sink down past the floor and blocked my exit……. So, I just clicked the button and went down. Three people came in and they were looking at me very weirdly so I explained what happened but I don't think they cared. 

The elevator took us to the roof of the building, and now we were all standing on the four corners of this wooden cube frame that was built on top of the elevator. I wanted the get down but the others are just chatting and having fun. No one was listening so I got off alone, but my side started to fall and I tried calling out but they’re still not listening so I thought ‘fuck it’ and went back to my room to get ready. Everyone was starting to line up to go so we got our tickets and joined the line. I remember standing in line and watching as the frame thing on top of the building collapse and thought those four people must have died….

Then I got a job working as a Nany, the kids were pretty cute, and their dad worked at a little pizza shop called “subway”. I got a Hawaiian pizza but anther worker came in and stole it. Then the mum came and said I was not right for the job cause the son was telling bullshit lies. He tried to stop me as i left but it was way too late… and I think I left them to be eaten by the monster, dunno maybe not.

We worked at a construction site now. There were monsters so I was getting people to stay in the light where you’re safe (think doctor who – the library). If any part of your body was in darkness they would latch onto you and drain all of the energy and flesh from your body leaving you a skeleton. There was a sexy lady that I saved and that night while we were tryna sleep the workers were all having a party so she went over to tell them to shut up, but I remembered the monster was a thing so I chased after her to help. Some dude signed me into the party and he was being a bit of a dick but I still wanted to save him, so I told him to jump from the balcony into the light below – which he did. So, he was safe but now I didn’t have anywhere to hide. 

I was waiting for death with my eyes closed but luckily the lady turned on all the lights! She saved me! I opened my eyes to thank her but...

669,Warning,2,ddy04r,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/ddy04r/warning/,0,"A group of policeboys have been assembled to form a squad. Something big is about to happen.
The dream starts with these policeboys, me being one of them, standing, not in any particular fashion, in square cul de sac. One of the walls is covered with black and yellow striped strips. 
The objective of our call to arms is yet unknown. But as it is a part of our job to go wherever we are called, there's not much choice either. The mood of the place is jovial. Most of the boys are upto random shenanigans.
Tired of waiting I arrange for a football and call out whoever wants to play can come. Not that I needed to. Seeing a football these boys run towards it like a dog.
We must have played for a while for the next thing I remember we are standing in another part of town. 
A larger, a square, one of those places which are usually the central heart of the city. More policemen. Disruptive disturbance among them. A growing restlessness. The boys want to know. At this point the crowd has grown to a substantial number. A crowd of policeboys. With weapons but no aim. 
I am standing in front of this crowd, at a small distance from them with a few other people.
Suddenly, almost at cue one of the boys standing with me loses it and starts shouting hysterically. He knew all along. Just didn't want to break anyone. With a large stick dabbed in red paint at one end he chants repeatedly while painting the three numbers on the road. 
'9/11 IS ABOUT TO HAPPEN!'
'9/11 IS ABOUT TO HAPPEN!!'
'9/11 IS ABOUT TO HAPPEN!!!'

Looking at the way that we were assembled and how great in numbers we were, the crowd perhaps expected something of this sort for there wasn't as big of a shock. It was as if we knew the meaning of 9/11. As if it had happened before. Somewhere in between I also got the insight that government had killed Osama bin Laden and now his son was hell bent on getting his revenge. 

Next thing you know, we are in a large room with wooden benches and a whiteboard on one wall. The room is packed with loud policeboys. A plan of action is needed. No one here knows what to do. 
Enter chief.
Not helpful chief. Just chief.
He tries to calm us. Reminds us of our true objective. After settling everyone down he asks us our opinion of what we can do. We start talking and soon it gets to the point where the chief asks who broke out the 'rumor' in the first place. A boy (an old school friend) gets up and tells the chief it was him. Silently I whisper in his ear from behind 'I knew even before you.'
Chiefs expression's are grave but he stays calm. He confirms the rumors and lets us know now that this time it, whatever it is, will be much, much bigger. The boys have lost all of their remaining patience. They want to save their lives now. 

Suddenly the ceiling panel starts shaking violently. Someone is trying to get in through the roof. 
Run.
Chief was the first one out of the door. A couple of boys ahead of me, I grab my bag as I exit the room. The strap gets stuck in the staircase handrail while I'm running too but immediately it is freed too.
 The passage was divided into two ways where the staircase ended. Everyone was going right. I saw only one lonely figure going left and I run after him. He slips into one room in line of many, in a long corridor. I try to get into another but as I reach for the door handle, boom.

Then I was hanging out with a Kpop group and just walking around the streets. After that, I went to a park to run for a bit. Then I was on a school bus with my high school friends and I was telling one of them about my day.

This part of the dream gets interesting and confusing. Now, we're at someone's house with my high school friends. On the tv, a recording of my dream was playing, I was aware that this was my dream but I was convinced I was now awake. We're just talking and joking not even paying much attention to the tv. Then the end credits start to roll out. They were kind of blurry and a bit staticky but I was trying to read them. I started to get scared because I started to overthink and question. This was my dream, how were there credits, what if I read something I wasn't meant to? And the thing is, this was the second time I saw them in the dream. Now I was semi-aware I was dreaming. I only remember up to here.

678,Trapped in the land of the dead,2,dduxlm,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/dduxlm/trapped_in_the_land_of_the_dead/,0,"I'm nineteen years old. I'm running through a razed city. Buildings are on fire, the streets are a mess, smoke rises into the air and makes it hard to breathe or see. It's something like a warzone. I don't know what I'm running from, but I am absolutely terrified. I know if it catches me that I'm done for.
There are a few other people running with me. I don't know any of them. 
We make it to this compound surrounded by a tall chainlink fence topped with barbed wire, but the gate has been busted open. One side of the gate is lying on the ground, completely torn off its hinges, the other kind of hangs there.
Inside the compound we find a helicopter, and one of the other survivors claims he knows how to fly. He starts it up, and we all try to scramble in. The thing is there isn't enough room for all of us. Laying close by is a rope. I volunteer to tie myself on to the landing skis of the helicopter, and we take flight.
We have escaped. Relief fills my mind even though I'm dangling by a rope. 
I can see the city in ruins. Everything is ablaze. Explosions erupt from buildings. I feel terrible for those that didn't make it out.
Suddenly, I hear an alarm going off from above me. I look up, and see the engine of the helicopter is smoking, and the rotor stalls.
We drop.
I remember the gut-wrenching feeling of weightlessness and terror as I fall still harnessed to the heli.
The ground rushes up so fast.
I don't feel the impact as everything goes black.
I wake up in a panic and try to take a deep breath, but I inhale sand instead of air. It tears at the inside of my nostrils and fills my mouth. I cough it out, and vomit a little as I pull myself out of a sand dune. 
I kneel there, and blast sandy snot rockets out of my nose, and spit sand out of my mouth.
I look around in awe at a massive, hot desert.
I realise I am dead as I remember the helicopter crash. Is this heaven? Hell, perhaps? Some kind of afterlife I have earned or been punished to during my years alive.
I stand up. The desert is hot, and I can see the shimmer of heat as I look out upon my surroundings. I start to walk, aimlessly.
I notice how I'm not sweating, or thirsty, or tired, even though the place I am in seems so unforgiving. It's confusing, but reassuring. I know for sure this is death.
I walk and walk. Up and over massive dunes, then down the other side. Time and time again. Nothing but sand. 
I walked for 2 days and nights. Going somewhere. Going nowhere. Just going. Sometime during the third day i see a figure in the distance, also walking on the dunes.
I start to shout and run toward it. As I get closer I can see that they are walking in my direction. They are dressed in a dark brown cloak. A hood covers their head and creates a dark shadow that obscures their face. A long, white beard is the only discernible feature I can see.
As I reach this man he remains calm.
I am overjoyed to meet another person in this desert.
I ask where I am, and where I should go.
He responds ""You're lucky I've found you instead of them. But, I know they already know you are here. We don't have time to waste, as they will not be kind if they find you. Come. We have a ways to go yet.""
""What?"" I say, ""What the hell does that mean?""
He turns and begins walking back in the direction he came from without explanation.
I stand there in disbelief, but decide to follow as he meanders his way through the sand. 
Again I walk for days, but now with a silent guide.
Eventually we come upon a giant city, with a massive stone wall fortifying it. It has to be about one hundred feet tall, and spans unending into either horizon. 
We walk to the wall, and then alongside it for a while, coming to a wooden double door set in it.
He stops and turns to me, ""From here you must stay close to me. Don't touch anything, and DON'T talk to anyone! Understand?""
I nod. 
He knocks on the door, and a ramshackle guard of sorts opens one of the doors. He looks at the old guide, then at me, snorts, and lets us in.
 The guard is not human. I've never seen anything like this creature before. Almost orcish looking, but hairy. Giant yellow tusks point upward out of its mouth. 
We walk past it, and into a bazaar.
There are beings everywhere. Some human, most are not. Aliens. Monsters. Whatever you'd like to call them. Coexisting. Trying to sell goods and wares. Haggling. Shouting. Laughing. It's all so surreal. 
I follow my guide in disbelief, trying not to stare at any of the creatures who are not paying any attention to us. 
We pass by a stand selling some kind of fruit, the likes of which I've never seen. I stop and pick one up, it seems like it would be delicious. The fruit seller says something to me in a foreign language. I look at it, and shrug.
Suddenly someone grabs my arm forcefully and shouts, ""I told you not to touch anything!""
I drop the fruit into the stand it came from, and am pulled away by my guide.
We make our way through, and out of this giant market into streets that are less bustling. 
It seems like a residential area.
Small mud and stone houses line the alleys, and fewer beings are hanging about.
We stop at one of the huts, and my guide pulls out a ring full of old, iron keys. He finds one amongst the many, and slides it into the keyhole of the wooden door and unlocks it. As he opens the door he turns to me and says, ""I'm sorry, but this is all I can do for you. You must do the rest.""
Then he grabs me by the shoulders and forces me into the small hut. 
I don't have time to protest or ask why before the door closes behind me and I hear the door lock again. 
Scrambling at the knob, I try to open the door and release myself. It's no use, I am trapped, and once again alone.
I begin crying uncontrollably. I feel so ashamed and angry for having been fooled. I slam my fists against the door and shout as tears continue to stream down my face. 
I collapse into the door and slide down to the ground, sobbing.
I lay there for a while feeling utterly defeated and betrayed. 
By this time my eyes have adjusted to the darkness of my prison as a little light creeps its way around the wooden door and through the few small cracks in it.
To my right is a small bed, with a tattered, old blanket on it. The wall opposite the door has a small dresser and a big, round shape draped with a white sheet.
I don't bother getting up, but instead just slump back down on the ground and begin to cry again.
I cry myself to sleep on the cold, dusty floor.
When I wake up the room is dark. No sunlight creeps through the door, and I assume it is night. I pick myself up off the floor and shuffle to where I remember the bed being. Slowly, I lower myself onto it, and drift off again.
I awake to see the light once again shines through the door, and come to remember I am trapped in this room. More tears and sorrow. 
This is my life for a few days.
On the fourth day I decide I should keep track of the time I spend here, so I scratch four lines into the wall above my bed. I assume I'll spend the rest of eternity here as penance for something I did in the Land of the Living. But I don't know what it was, as I kniw I lived a rather mundane, and non-violent life.
Day eight: I open the three drawers of the dresser to find they contain nothing, and I finally remove the sheet from the round shape next to the dresser. It's a big vanity mirror. For the first time in 8 days I see my own reflection. I look exactly how I remembered myself looking the last time I peered into a mirror.
I sit down in front of the mirror and just stare at my own reflection. I talk to myself, and try to assure myself I will be okay, and things will work out the way they are meant to.
The next day, I sit infront of the mirror, and I decide to meditate. I clear my mind, and try to attain peace. 
It takes a few weeks, but eventually I reach a state of stillness.
I continue this ritual every day.
Day 783: I have a hard time maintaining my stillness for some reason. I can't figure out why.  So I open my eyes, and notice that the mirror in front of me is different somehow. I reach out to touch it and my reflection begins to ripple.
The ripples grow in size and then calm, revealing a reflection that is not my own.
I can see a young woman, about sixteen or seventeen years old, sitting at a desk applying mascara. She is beautiful. I assume she is getting ready to go out sonewhere.
I know this is my chance.
I slowly reach toward the mirror, and feel fear as my hand slips through the glass. I notice her expression change to fear as well as I make my way through this portal of sorts. I climb out onto her desk and free myself from the solitude I had been confined to. She stares up at me and begins to scream. 
I wake up in my own bed, and inhale my the deepest breath I have ever taken. I am alive again. 
I'll never forget her face, or let go of the guilt I feel for causing such trauma to someone. I still think about her from time to time. I wonder if I'll ever get to meet her again. Is she even still alive? Why was she vital in my resurrection?

The first one wasn’t relevant but then the last two were connected, so here it is. 

Dream One:

So I got a text from my friend, Pierre, who sent a text saying “come to the German teacher’s house.” Me: “Why?” Pierre: “Just come here.” So I got to the house, which in real life is my grandparents house. I open the door into the cold, dark, kitchen and see Pierre standing there. All around him are multiple guitars, each with triangle pieces cut out of them. As I turn to leave, the German teacher walks in with his groceries. While I’m walking away I turn and see him step into the house, freeze, and drop all the bags on the ground. 

Dream Two:

I’m in my high school with a group of mostly friends. It’s night out, and all lights in the school are out. No light except for a few red emergency lights. Then, my biology teacher comes over the P.A. And says “Come to the game room.” In real life, this section of the school is a staircase though in the dream it was a solid wall. A small staircase appeared which led to a room higher up in the wall. Me and the group all headed in. Inside there was a TV hooked up to an Xbox, a long leather couch that went almost the entirety of the room, and my bio teacher in a wooden chair. “You will each play this game one by one.” he says. We all sit down and he goes through the line. He finally gets to Pierre, who’s sitting next to me. As Pierre gets up a day “oh yeah, Pierre, what were you doing at the German teacher’s house?” He’s standing in front of me. He turns to face me, puts his hand up to his mouth, and proceeds to spit up the wooden guitar triangles from earlier. He then places them in my lap and goes to play the video game.

So yeah it was weird. The weirdest dream I’ve ever had. My and my friends always have a good laugh whenever I tell the story. Was wondering if anyone could find a deep meaning at all. But I hope you enjoyed it:)",1570359160.0

At one point we go into this Forrest and find a gun. So I take the gun, call the police, and give it to them.

That part really has nothing to do with the rest of the dream

So after that I go to a dinner party with a bunch of my friends. But this dinner party is at this house, that feels like belongs to all of us at once. I don’t know how to describe it, but let’s move on.

So we’re all sitting at this table eating, and all of a sudden this ghost comes in. This ghost was like clear and you could see through him, he kinda looked like high five ghost, just with two arms in their correct positions instead of one. This ghost isn’t being scary or anything, but he’s being like annoying and asking us for food.

So one of my friends walks up to this Frame on the wall, and the frame has like a cut out piece of a quilt or blanket. The cloth had a little design on it, it was a diamond, with four more diamond in it. And they were each a color, red, green, blue, and yellows.
 
This guy touches the blanket and turns into a ghost, and beats up the other ghost. And everyone’s like cheering him on. But as my friends beating up the annoying ghost, more of that ghosts buddy’s come in.  Now there are like four or five annoying ghosts, and my friend explains to us that the only way to fight ghosts, is to touch the blanket to change into a ghost.

So I decide to turn into a ghost, and I help my buddy out. So we keep fighting these ghosts, but more keep coming. And as more keep coming, more friends turn into ghost form to help us fight. And for some reason, this all had a like comedic vibe to it. 

So eventually my friends and I are outnumbered by the ghosts, and all of a sudden, one of my friends touches the blanket a second time. This takes my friends and I, and like locks our souls in the blanket. So we all become the blanket, and then all the ghosts we we’re fighting just explode.

The dream ended with some lady feeding our collective souls in the blanket.",1570330949.0

It either takes place in a church basement, my school gym, or the cafeteria. I'm there chilling out with my friends and other random people that go to my school when suddenly a group of people busts in (7-20 people) and starts threatening everyone. Sometimes the group is armed with guns, other times knives, and rarely, nothing. They always have the intent of killing everyone but sometimes ""mess around first"" by injuring me in many different painful ways. By this point, the dream starts constantly switching between third and first person every few seconds. Either I get up from the torture or emerge from the crowd to fight them and I always succeed at stopping them, most the time without killing them. Very very rarely kill them in the dream and when I do it's always by biting or ripping them apart. I rarely emerge unscathed, most of the time I am either critically injured or die. No matter what happens the police come in and secure the area after this. If I was critically injured, I always tell my friends that I may die and what to do if that happens. The dream then goes to me learning how to live the rest of my life with the injury. If I die, I bleed out slowly and offer my friends some last tips of advice and give them all letters containing personal messages for them.

No matter what the dream ends on a positive note, as I feel fulfilled that I protected my friends, even if it cost me my life.

I walk through a very large long dining hall to a kitchen, to the side I see and notice two kids playing in water or something
and making a mess. I am at first concerned they are special needs or something, but then a woman later comforts me that they're fine.

I end up in the kitchen and focus heavily with my full field of vision on a whiteboard/magnetboard on the fridge. I don't know if anything is
written on it, but there is a blue LCD/LED like clock in the upper left, all one piece, with no black square for the digits, they are just
more illuminated than the body of the clock.

There are magnets on other corners of the board, and then I see the aforementioned woman for the first time. She doesn't talk that I recall
but assures me the kids are ok.

Rough sketch of the board in the kitchen with the clock and magnets - the bottom drawing is the board itself.

689,Best friend dog bit me.,2,ddscit,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/ddscit/best_friend_dog_bit_me/,2,"The dream goes like this... One of my childhood best friends came to my house to pick me up and we went outside in a park, he was in a very good mood as usual. When we got to the park he started arguing with me that I'm always silent and I only come out with him to meet new people around him.(or something from this nature). We have a very good and honest relationship in real life. This part kinda makes sense because I'm not a very social person.

I went and sat on a distant bench because I felt bad, he later came and asked me if I want something to eat or if I want cigarettes because he was going to the shop. I said that I'm going home, he said ""do as you wish"" and turned his back.

I got up from the bench and started looking for my flip flops. I forgot to mention I left my house with my house flip flops 😂 and during the dream I left them on one of the slides. I found them, got down from the slide and his little dog came running and barking at me. He got me by the index finger of my right hand and started growling and biting. I was not scared, I was looking the dog dead In his eyes without moving, not even blinking(I am not scared of dogs I've had a couple of pitbulls, I've also been bit numerous times.). He let go, and went and bit me again. The second time I grabbed him with my other hand by the top jaw and started squeezing until he squeaked and ran away. There was no blood, the dog wasn't biting with his full force.

All of a sudden my best friend's girlfriend came out of nowhere and asked me what happened. I explained and she called the dog back. The dog refused to come close to her, turned around at me and said ""I got you"". 
That's pretty much it.

I woke up at around six thirty needing to go to the bathroom. So I went. I got extremely cold going there and back to my room so decided to turn off the fan. I didn't have to get up for school since it was a Saturday morning and it was still dark outside so I decided to go back to sleep.

This is where things get weird. I tossed and turned a lot and just couldn't get back to sleep, so I decided to go on youtube. I picked up my phone and saw an endless number of notifications. I started scrolling through them but they all just said random things that didn't make any sense. Not only that, but I realized whatever notification I predicted would be next always was. I tested this by thinking of the words red hot chilly pepper and soon enough that's what the next notification said.

And that made me realize that I had in fact fallen asleep and was dreaming. That got me excited so I sat up and tried to change my bedroom. But the more I tried, it felt like something was pressing on my chest, forcing me to lay back down in my bed and I don't know ... follow the script of my dream I guess? And the whole time this was happening, I remember feeling extremely exhausted and dazed, like I was on laughing gas or something similar. And there was also this feeling of dread in the air like I was being watched or something bad was about to happen. And there wasn't a single sound except for the air conditioner and the sounds I made whenever I moved.

I finally woke up for real a few minutes later but wasn't sure if I was awake or still in the dream. So I checked my phone and there wasn't a single notification there at all. What do y'all make of this? BC I have no clue.",1570332924.0
691,This has been on my mind for a while...does anyone else remember specific dreams they had as a child? Dreams that occurred over & over or ones that affected you so much that you still remember?,6,ddmtdm,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/ddmtdm/this_has_been_on_my_mind_for_a_whiledoes_anyone/,11,"I read all these posts in paranormal or glitch in the matrix about these dreams people have had. Someone said they remembered a dream from being 7 months old. I remember thinking yeah right. But yet, I remember so many dreams from my childhood/growing up. How do you even know what was a dream or what was real? How do you know if it was a dream and not a distant memory? 


For example: I distinctly remember being outside as a kid...maybe around 6-7 years old. I remember playing on our swing set. It was a hot summer day in Indiana and I was getting ready to climb up to the little landing when all the sudden 2-3 huge dogs (I always specifically thought coyotes) came up aggressively. I remember running as fast as I could to the side door on our house, bawling my eyes out & screaming. Now, a couple months ago I finally brought it up to my mom who told me that had to be a dream. Coyotes don’t do that. Only I’ve watched many videos where they do. I just don’t know how to figure out what’s real and what isn’t. Makes me feel a tad crazy sometimes lol 


Another dream that I used to have as a kid a lot was one that messed with me. My husband is the only one I’ve told this to. This is super strange. Lol. I don’t remember much of the dream, but I remember being suffocated by a boob. No joke. Like I was breastfeeding as a baby and ended up smothered. I was breastfed shortly as a baby, but I wouldn’t think it would’ve been long enough to have a memory like this? My mom got really sick shortly after having me, then I did too. I had scarlet fever and she had mastitis. I would wake up from that dream panicking and out of breath. I was always embarrassed for having it too. But I had it SO many times as a child. And now I have this major fear of being suffocated/held down. If I get pinned to the ground, I freak out.  


These obviously aren’t life changing questions I’m asking here. I’m just trying to understand. I randomly have my childhood dreams pop up in my head so just curious why. And even why I remember them. I don’t have the best memory so of all things to remember, why these things?? 


I also remember always having to protect our house in my dreams. There was like a war of the worlds going on in our backyard and I remember having a string (like a kite) and being pulled up in the sky, but fighting like hell to get back down to the ground. Stuff like that or random people trying to get in and kill us and we’d have to blockade our home. My brother has off the wall dreams too. I’m not sure if my sister ever did while she was alive. But my brother dreams of zombie apocalypses and stuff like that. 


I’m 34 now and still have these dreams occasionally.",1570308426.0

At 4:30am I really wanted to sleep so I tried. Closest I could achieve to sleep was this weird hallucinatory lucid dreaming.

I dreamt that I was sat in maths class and I was only allowed to go to sleep in the bed at the front of the class (it looked so beautiful and comfy) if I completed a whole page of maths problems.
I did not want to do that.
So I stood up, walked over to my teacher and absolutely walloped her in the face. I could actually feel the connection of her cheek on my fist in real life. But as soon as I got into the comfy bed at the front, the dream reset and I was back in my seat.
So I stood up and punched her, much harder this time. But again, I was back! 😭 I tried this many many times but it failed every time.
So I gave up trying to sleep and got back to pingin.

694,I drank the wrong koolaid,2,ddr5q2,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/ddr5q2/i_drank_the_wrong_koolaid/,0,"So another two parter. And boy is this a doozy. So the first part of the dream starts rather normally. Im an art major and living in a dorm. I meet some guy who saves my life and the world goes to hell.

Its me and him in a relatively safe apartment. Adequite food, running water, and immunity to whats out there. On occassion someone tries to seek sanctuary with us, but he refuses to let anyone in. 

The latest was a father and daughter. They banged heavily on the door.  ""Please."" The father yelled. ""If not me then my daughter please take her in.""

He's not having it despite my insistence. ""It could be a trap."" He growls. ""Let's see.""

He steps out and confronts the father and his 5year old daughter. He paces around them wiestioning both.

I hear the father mutter ""They're listening"" and see the earbud in his ear. I snatch it and toss it as a car pulls up with three other people.

""Failed to mention the car buddy. Seems you guys are good on your own. Let me guess there are more waiting? Get out of here."" The guys picks up his daughter and they leave. We head back in and bunker down.

We had been there a while, i was getting lonely and he insisted only he could be trusted. I tristed him to a point but... Another knock on the door.

I peered through the peephole and saw raven hair and the familiar slant of eyes.

""Sho."" I cried out opening the door. She was a gorgeous asian female from the film department. She specialized in dogital effects and movies.

The male wasn't having it though. ""We dont know if its really her."" He said.

""Babe, help me with something."" She said as sge befan prepping a work station. As she sat down at the digital station she gan weaving filmscenes together into a diamond tapestry the same 3scenes. A woman in a pink flowing robe slowly turn towards the camera. A woman in a blue robe talking with a man. And a woman in a blue robe descendimg stairs on a horse. When she finished she played the woven film. Sounds accompanied each real and somehow blended into a soft melody that played over and over.

Regardless though Sho earned his trust and we went out of the apartment to the music department. There were more people there.

A class was in session on the difference between classical and other pseudo-classical musics. He played one with harps and strings, that to me sounded like a traditional classical song but explained due to the addition of certain instruments was less than 50years old, and as such not classical but charlayne. He played another he described as serrated due to the sharp beat of the violas. 

We listened to the lesson for a few hours and then broke for lunch. As i walked up the stairs i dropped something i turned to grab it but he slresdy had it in hand and he grabbed my arm roughly to demamd what I was doing. I started to answer but a knife was plunged into my stomach. I woke up then.

I had the dream last night, but this time it was my own hand wrapped around my balls, and I calmly reassured myself, convincing my hand to loosen its grip.

I walk by my brother's room, where I hear him groaning. I peek in and see him slumped in his chair with a defeated expression.

""Dude, what's wrong?"" I asked.

""I entered a game jam... There's only a little bit of time left... My game is nowhere near finished..."" He mumbled.

&#x200B;

I take a look at his computer screen. On it was an unfinished co-op adventure game with sub-par graphics. It had a few areas implemented, but with no goal. And while there was health bars, there was no enemies.

""I better get back to work..."" He muttered.

&#x200B;

The doorbell then rang. I left my brother to his work and went to the door. I opened it to see the mailman, who handed me an envelope and left. The envelope was adressed to my brother.

""Hey, dude, there's a letter for you"" I exclaimed.

My brother walks over and takes the envelope from me. He opens it, and read it with a worried expression.

""There's only 6 months left?! I'll never get it done by then!"" He cried. He then walks over to his bed and lays down in defeat.

&#x200B;

""Uhh, want me to help make the game less, horrible?"" I offered.

""Go ahead."" He answered.

I sat down at his desk and looked at the code he had already done. While it was fine, his vision for the game could simply not be done in 6 months. So I took it upon myself to change the genre. It would be easy, considering how little my brother have done, it could've really been anything. Inspired by River City Girls, I began reworking the game into a beat 'em up.

And with my help, my brother was able to finish the game on time for the Game Jam... is what would've happened, if I didn't wake up halfway through coding the game.",1570326997.0

700,The only dream I've ever had where I woke up screaming.,26,ddhfl0,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/ddhfl0/the_only_dream_ive_ever_had_where_i_woke_up/,3,"I had this dream like twenty years ago but it sticks with me.

In the dream I was a scientist and it was in first person perspective so I was seeing through my own eyes. Part of a small team of scientists. We were working on an experiment that would transport an object from one location to the other. We had built a laser type device that when it hit an object it would grab it, atom by atom, and transfers each atom to our designated location which was only a few feet away. 

The object we chose was a sewing needle.

In the dream this was the first time we were ready to fire the beam and try the experiment. Before we began there was one scientist in the group, an old man, who took his last opportunity to talk us out of it.

He said something to the effect of, ""Before we do this I want to say one more time that there is a small chance that we might destroy the universe.""

In this dream, he explained that when we grab an atom it's in a state of suspension for just a millionth of a second, and that small fraction of a second equates to us technically taking an object that exists in the past (again, just a millionth of a second in the past) and cramming it into a time and space where it didn't exist. He said that if we thought of matter in the universe as an arch, removing or adding from it, even something as small as an atom, could cause the arch to fall and the universe to collapse.

I should note here, I'm not a scientist in real life. I don't science at all.

Anyway, we decided to go ahead with the experiment.
We fired the beam and watched as the tip of the needle started to disappear and on the other table it began to assemble. Almost immediately the universe began to fall apart. The first thing that was apparent is that reality seemed placid and two dimensional. Imagine your looking down at your phone and there is no difference in depth from where your phone is to anything behind it. That your thumbs, although they are closer to your face and move normally, your vision is flat and 2 dimensional, so there is no difference in the distance in anything you see even though you know somethings are further or closer then others. Instead of depth, my vision was now like a flat painting that moved. 
Everything in the lab started doing this, the scientists were screaming and then, it started to drip. Reality couldn't hold itself up anymore and started falling like melted plastic in an oven. The woman infront of me was screaming as this depth less world started melting away and I watched in horror as the walls and machines in the room slowly dripped into each other as the world was melting down. Then the woman in front of me began to melt with it, her face blobbed into a long drip melting in with the falling room, and the sound of her scream turned into a distorted pitch that was slowing down as all the other sounds in the room seemed like they were playing their last dying note.

And then I felt it. I felt my self start to melt with everything else. I felt myself dripping in with everything else and my mind begin to freeze like everything else. My thoughts were stopping and I was beginning to melt into oblivion. I started to scream and I woke up screaming. Not a over and over again scream, just a long scream that pulled me out of that nightmare.

710,The Spanking Crone,2,ddncy5,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/ddncy5/the_spanking_crone/,0,"My boyfriend was telling me about recurring nightmares he had as a kid. It was about a demon-like woman he called “The Crone” who would turn him over and spank him repeatedly.  He said she had pigtails and was very creepy. She has made an appearance in his dreams several times and over time she began to morph into a scary lion. But then, as he got older, he was really sick of the Crone, so he beat the shit out of her and she never appeared again. 

Last night we were watching a new movie on Hulu called Uncanny Annie. He said the little girl looked exactly like the Crone from his dream.  He started questioning whether or not some people have also seen this woman before or if she’s even real. The little girls mannerisms in the film were just like the Crone’s. 

Also let me just add, he was bullied as a kid and he got licks (spanks) from his teachers before that shit was considered a no no in school. Not sure if that fear had anything to do with the dream.  

So my question....has anyone ever experienced a dream like this or has seen a woman like this? I find it weird that she kept coming back to haunt him.",1570311493.0
711,Haunted house and correctional facility wrapped into one,2,ddn0wa,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/ddn0wa/haunted_house_and_correctional_facility_wrapped/,0,"Hey all. I am new to this subreddit, but not new to my fascination with dreams and their meanings. I would like to share my dream I had last night. 

It started out in the Walmart parking lot. Me, plus 4 other people went to a haunted house (I am very fascinated with the afterlife and supernatural things). We went to this house that was abandoned in the woods somewhere. It was a very unsafe home as it was decaying rapidly. The group leader (who I would describe as an emo/gothic guy), decides that we are going to summon the ghosts and demons that reside in this house. Reluctantly, we oblige. We all sit down on the floor against a wall. He summons the spirits. Unfortunately, I don't remember what happened in that portion of the dream, other than we made it out alive. 

Then, as many dreams do, it transitioned into a mental facility (correctional, but more like Litchfield camp than Litchfield max OITNB) While we are inhabiting the correctional facility, it is bombed or blows up. At this point it's me plus 30 other men and women in this facility. We are told that we will be moved to another facility in Tennessee (where I am from and live currently.) We are picked up on a charter bus driven by this little Hispanic woman (she is more like a midget.) The bus ride seems normal until we get about 20 miles from the TN border. The bus driver turns around and heads back to the old facility ( it felt like it was upstate somewhere.) She tells us that she has orders to bring us back immediately. We do this a total of 3 times. We never make it to TN due to here turning around so many times.  We all come to the consensus that something is not right. It feels like we are being imprisoned on this bus or that she wants to kidnap us. The last trip back upstate, we actually get off the bus at a station. The driver then disappears and we try to hunt her down. We locate her multiple times, but she slips away so easy when we have her in our sights. She seems subhuman, almost like a creature from the X-Files (season 1 ep 3 ""Squeeze"".) I woke up after that.  I guess I will never know what happened to subhuman Hispanic woman in my dream!",1570309592.0

I know dreams about flight are quite common, but just felt like sharing.

It’s a dream I’ve been having for years now, but it’s not very frequent (every few months maybe) and it’s not the exact same dream but quite similar. I’m walking down a street or an alley or something similar when suddenly I “remember” that I can fly, and always think to myself “oh sh\*t! I Forgot I could do that, how could I have forgotten”, then I start going at it, but it is not really flying it is kind of flimsy or like some irregular kind of hovering. It’s like the gravity is not as strong but I still have to make effort to stay in the air, but I get better at it after a while.

What I really “like” about this dream is the way in which I fly but especially the way in which I “remember” that I can fly, it’s somewhat like when you realize you were only dreaming when you wake up but it’s during the dream.",1570301328.0

I don't know where I start out, but I enter a mansion and talk to an old guy who has his son and his wife with him. I end up touring the mansion with them. We walk up the stairs and I'm just barely in front of the wife and the child is in front of me. I'm with a friend, but I'm unsure of who it is. This time unlike most times, I know what's going to happen as if it's a video game. After about 10 or so minutes, the wife falls over and passed out cause she wasn't very fit. In this time, the old man grabs two pans and kneels down next to his wife and bangs them together while saying a prayer, in hope that his wife won't die. He then tells us that we must save her and that were her only hope. We walk down the long corridor walkway which was kind of like a bridge over the entire first floor. After a little while, I notice a glove looking thing that was kind of like the infinity gauntlet. I told it to come up to the balcony and so it did. It kind of ""digested my hand"" to become one with it. I said ""I hope this thing will come off afterwards."" We then continued down the hallway. We then went to the ""next scene"" and I was at a certain area that was like my school, but wasn't. It was a corner intersection between two buildings. With my new glove, I decided to climb up the building with it. At each window, my hands felt sweatier. And the only thing that kept me alive was the glove. As I neared the top of what seemed like a 5-6 story building, there were signs up there that said ""lol."" Once I was up there, my other friend was also up there And I didn't question how he got up there (until now). Anyway, as people noticed us at the top of the building, some tried to climb up. I don't remember anyone falling, but I do remember that there was this kind of autistic kid that goes to out school, John. We told him not to come up, but he did anyway. There were styrofoam blocks shaped like trees on top of the roof and they were blown over on top of me. The glove helped me out and pulled me out from underneath it. We threw the blocks off the roof, but it was still crowded with mats and other things like that. We looked for an exit at the top of the roof, but there was none in clear view, however, what we did find was a secret storage. There were two things inside of the storage. They were red and blue. but I had already guessed that. I had guessed that there were 3 of them... Blue white and red, however, I guessed again that it was blue and red. I was right of course. We then searched for a new way off the roof. We grabbed my glove and fashioned him in a certain way to bring up down the building as if it were a grappling hook. We took the things that were on top of the roof and got off of it. I then realized that the windows had steps on them so if you did get stuck on the roof that you could get off. We started heading down, but as we went down level by level, we got closer to one floor that had it's windows as wooden crates as if they were on shelves. I took a peak in and there was a rabbit staring in the opposite direction. In short, I threw the crate at him and he ran right out the window and out to the floor. I retreated back up to the top floor/the roof(which was actually the 9th floor, I remember myself counting the floors at this point). The rabbit, however, could jump at extreme heights. He jumped all the way from the ground to the 8th floor in a single leap. The only weird part is that after a couple attempts of the rabbit trying to get me, my gaze turned into staring into the eyes of a wolf. The wolf took over my vision. All I could see was the wolf and the outlines of the roof top around me. It's eyes were white and it's skin was black, but it's hair was normal.",1570318748.0

721,My dream may have bled into real life,1,ddni4a,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/ddni4a/my_dream_may_have_bled_into_real_life/,0,"I was either three or four years old when this happened, but I remember it quite vividly. 

It was really late, probably two in the morning. I was laying down on my left side, staring at the wall, which was about a few feet away from my bed. I had my night light on, which illuminated this faint yellow glow throughout the whole room, because no way was I sleeping in the dark at that age.

At this point, I'm pretty sure I was dreaming, because all the sudden my older brother is standing next to my bed, looking at me. He doesn't say anything. I don't say anything. After a moment, he starts walking away, and eventually he just faded away, right before my eyes. It was like someone turned the transparency up and he disappeared right then and there.

So, immediately I'm like ""what the fuck was that?"" You know how three year olds usually talk. I get up out of bed and walk across the hall to my brother's room and there I find him fast asleep in his bed. And just to be sure it was actually him, I decided to pull at his eyelids (I guess in an attempt to wake him; I don't know why I did that lol). He wakes up all grumbly asking what am I doing in his room. I'm convinced he's real, then I go back to my room and fall back asleep.

Years later, I bring this up with my brother and he still remembers me walking into his room and pulling at his eyelids.

So, I guess I wasn't dreaming? But technically I was, since I did see my brother in my room, even though it wasn't actually him. Still weirds me out to this day.",1570312282.0

I infortunately don't remember that alot of details, since the dream was very vague in It's nature.

**Before beginning with the dream,** I'm gonna share my daily life details. I'm 20 years old, male, I still live with my Father but I'm about to pass to hostel soon. I still attend school, a special education one which takes kids up to 21 of age. I was diagnosed with ADHD back when I was a small kid attending a elementary school, but later on I was ""Cured"" from it. Today however, I was diagnosed with; Oppositinal Defiant disorder (2015, 10/12), Socialised Conduct Disorder (2016, 4/2), Conduct Disorders (2015, 10/12), OCD (2016, 11/2), and later on OTHER NONORGANIC PSYCHOTIC DISORDERS and  UNSPECIFIED NONORGANIC PSYCHOSIS.

Last years starting from high school, I became short tempered and was quickly to anger, turning into destructive behavour and acting on my impulses up even to this day. My sleep schedule is also kinda bad, and I have those worry thoughts that I will not be able to sleep. Later on those days, I'm experiensing some conflicts with my Father, usualy fron the steem that he is ""Dissapointed"" in me that I didn't follow up his expectations, he wont get off me about that I should start living alone and telling me to get a job (Being very pushy about it).

I do care about my ""Self-image"", I'm trying to exercize, sometimes struggling with my laziness, as those last 3 years I gained lots of weight and a quite amount of fat, I even had to throw away some clothes because they didn't fit me. I do care about my clothing choice and always trying to fit it on my style. Unfortunately, when I wen't with my Father to buy shoes and clothes, my Father responded with ""Ha! See? Told you I was right."" when the seller said to him ""Well, actualy, your son is more full than you"" something like that. That wasn't pleasant for me, cause I know that my Father ingludge the same food as me and he very rarely does exercize compared to me.

&#x200B;

**Anyway, here is my dream;**

`Seemingly, the dream started with my Father getting a better PC than me. Later on, he even got a Better phone than me and started to boast about it, said ""See? Now I have better phone than yours!"". The phone that my Father got in the dream seems like an old telephone with bottoms, yet I preceived that his phone is better than mine, but still I asked ""Does your phone has buttons?"", my Father responded Negatively to that, I don't remember how the conversation went on.`

`Later on, something happened that the Monitor of my PC was unable to hold properly, as It's ""Leg"" got absolutely broken and unable to stand properly, so then I got dissapointed, as my Monitor rendered unuseable because of that.`

`Then, I see that my Father has started to play Undertale (Yes, that game), he seems to enjoy it, even though in my waking life, my Father never played undertale and he doesn't like those games. When looking at his Game screen, I've noticed 3 characters there standing facing the screen; Flowey, Chara and Asgore.`

`The game got glitched to hell though, and my Father for some reason put the blame on me, and told me I should fix it, or something like that.`

`I've decided to see what happened to his game (Undertale), and this is where the Dream wen't weird, creepy and completely f*cked up.`

`So what happened to the game exactly? Well, the game seemed to be completely glitched, just purple colored ""Glitch"" effects everywhere. To describe how I interpreted it as, some haunting ""Evil"" entity, which was female, has cursed the game during It's ""Initiation"" proccess.`

`This is the part of the dream where it wen't vague. I just remember that I was struggling to somehow eliminate this entity, to make the game Undertale to launch properly.`

`The ""Evil"" entity was just so extended out it started to corrupt the world outside of the Undertale game. Purple colored ""Glitch"" effects everywhere.`

`I remember that there are 3 ""Evil"" characters that was plaguing the Dream world:`

`> The main ""Evil"" entity. For some reason, she was a Female, she seemed to have purple hair, and she seemed to be very determined in keeping plaguing the Dream world, she quite resembled Maleficient in rest of her appearance.`

`> The second character, seemed to be a man, a shadowy figure but all purple, he seemed to be wearing a Fedora hat and a Trench coat.`

`> Third character, was for some reason, was Shrek. So random. And yeah, he was also an ""Evil"" entity, just like the 2 above. He didn't have anything ""Extraordinary"" expect his face was creepy for some reason, he had a little of blood coming out of his eyes.`

`The dream wen't on with me numerious times trying to contain all this ""Evil"" plague.`

`It is the last scene of the dream, where I reached my Father's PC, booted up the game Undertale. The scenario started with Sans the skeleton first looking at me, but then he started walking on to the Right side of the game screen, I was at this part hoping that booting up the game again would make Undertale starting normaly and eliminating this weird cursed plague.`

`Second later I've heard voice saying ""Don't look, or death will come."", purple glitch effects starting to appear as Sans was walking in the Game screen to the Right side, meanwhile the 3 ""Evil"" entities are standing looking at Sans. I covered my eyes, as the voice said. I was in hope that Sans reaching the Right side of the Game screen will eliminate this cursed plague from the game and the Dream world. But to my surprise, while I was trying to not look and cover my eyes with my hands I still able to see the game screen with Sans trying to reach the other side.`

`This is where it started to get intense, rest of the game was blacking out expect for Sans face, as Sans was reaching the Right side of the screen, this is where the feeling of creepiness and dread started to intensify. I covered my eyes as hard as I could but I was still able to see the screen a little, it is then at the end when Sans reached the Right side of the screen just standing there and facing my direction, suddently Shrek's face appeared, though I'm not sure it was really visible, It's like It's there and not there at the same time, but I just remember It's details perfectly for some reason, already described above. At this moment the creepiness and dreadfulness got very intense, which resulted in my waking up with a gasp.`

Strange thing about this dream is; I'm not sure why it used the Purple color as the representation of the evil entities. I'n real life, purple (Especialy violet) is my favorite color, green is next after it. Especialy that purple for me symbolises being powerful and overall I just find this color the most beautiful, inspired from all those anime's where powerful characters have their super/magical powers purple colored, unless there is something more to this color that I'm missing. And about glitch effects, same as purple color, It's very cool effect and I use it quite alot when I make my animations (Which is a thing for another thread).

So yeah, dream interpretation please, guys?",1570310795.0

I had left my sister so I was moving quickly, afraid of the men doing something to her.

My mom is laying on the bed and I get go to her and sit next to her and tell her about these guys. She says nothing and just smiles.

I dreamt that I was working in a NASA like mission control style room. I had a partner who helped me with with all my duties. We were working on a really big project, it was big in both monetary compensation and work load, so we had been at the office working for almost a week. I felt like shit, not because of overworking myself, but because I hadn't seen Her in a while and the project was stopping me from going home. I finally had enough and decided to make it so that I could never work there again. I started off small and made a mess of the work area. I let crumbs of food drop into computers and consoles. My partner cleaned it and kept working. I went a more extreme route and started dropping water on them. He freaked out and quickly dried it off. I took it one step more and started deleting files and closing important programs, to which my partner reset my computer to a backup that's periodically made throughout the day. I realized that as long as he was watching I wouldn't be able to do anything, so I stopped. He went back to his work and looked away for a minute. I quickly deleted the files, crashed the computer, and poured water onto it to make sure it was irrecoverable. I packed my things and got up. My partner looked over and flipped. On my way out I told my boss that I quit and walked out of the room. It felt great. Then the dream ended.",1570297510.0

733,Another one of my weird media-themed dreams.,1,ddkg4w,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/ddkg4w/another_one_of_my_weird_mediathemed_dreams/,0,"Yesterday I dreamed of a carnotaurus-looking dinosaur (it basically was like a reddish T-Rex with horns) attacking Spongebob's house, and Ash, Misty and Brock from Pokémon try to defeat it. Since I woke up just a few hours ago I have a good amount of memories of it to describe it in detail.

The dinosaur was around twice as tall as Spongebob's house while the others were around the size of the usual character of the show, meaning that by comparison the carnotaurus-thingy was absolutely massive. To defat it they first shoot it with water using a water Pokémon to get it wet (even if they already are underwater?) and then the trainers line up alongside some of their Pokémon to ""carry electrical power to Pikachu"" or something.
A shock comes from Ash at the bottom of the line (like, no Pokémon or weapon, he's the one that casts the shock all by himself) and moves to the other trainers and Pokémon, it ultimately reaches Pikachu that uses it to shock the dinosaur to death with a mid-air shock (like the Thunderbolt he uses in the Anime) after a high jump.

The dinosaur drops dead on the floor next to Spongebob's house, which remained intact, Pikachu then lands on the ground and smiles, and I wake up.

Also the only Pokémon I remember were Pikachu and a Mankey (being one of the ""links"" used in Ash's electrical attack), I don't remember any of the other ones, including the water one that ""wet"" the dinosaur.

What's wrong with my dreams always being weird like this? Like, I do have occasions where I remember my dreams and most of them are all crossovers of stuff I like or weird versions of them. I have a ton of similar media-themed dreams, as in ""cartoons/videogames"" etc., but I guess that's to be expected since I barely have any friends and don't go outside often, so stuff that I look at on screens is what my brain has to work with when I sleep, I think...",1570292255.0

I was at the house with one of my friend and two other people I had never seen before. I remember I had to keep telling them to tell me who I was talking to because I couldn’t see. When we were all done hanging out I slept on the floor at that house. This is where it got weird. I remember DREAMING inside of my dream. I could feel myself laying down on the floor in my original dream. I can’t remember what happened in my dream that I was dreaming about. But I’m pretty sure it was lucid. Then I woke up in real life. The entire time in the original dream it had felt completely normal, then when I started dreaming in my dream, I knew that I was dreaming because I had thought I was awake in the original dream.

All I remember is that I walked into this video game shop that had a tropical theme to it - either that or it was just a normal game store with orange walls.

Anyway, when walking into the store I was greeted by Spongebob watching his pet, Gary, on this small, mechanical plane that controlled the plane flying in Jellyfish Fields that was being shown on the video game on the projector screen. My presence instantly made them turn their heads and smile at me oddly - note that they were ready to tickle me because it is most likely for me that when I have a dream with a spongebob-theme to it, I will be followed or literally be given a test by the characters and once they got me or I fail the test they will tickle me - a very annoying experience.",1570276069.0

My dream 
Some kind of futiristic pastures and im running around and over mysteriously big fallen trees and seeing disturbing creatures. 
I, i guess i teleport home, or rather ""home"" whatever it was and suddenly im in the middle of trying to find an empty space to sleep with a very good looking girl, i dont know where that came from. Fastforward a little and im in the middle of a field thats supossed to be the little field in front of my appartment building but its a whole lot bigger and the girl is there qith me, the one i was suppssed to dream of having sex with. She and i are talking, when all of a sudden, since theres some kind of event? , that my sick mind came up with, come out of nowhere these disturbing looking priests? monks?  I dont know, but they were disturbing in every sense of the word, like, not scary, well, a bit scary, but not like nightmare fuel by them selves, the way they moved and looked at us and everything else made the scene so much more scary than it should have been. Me and the girl walk forward. She is scared of them apparently, and sobbingly squezes my hand, while im calm and colected, they only disturbed me right before i woke up from the dream and then later more. The last scene i remember is of me and the girl, who, id like to state, that i dont even know, of all things i cant remember her face and thats bugging me, so me and the girl walk up to some of the
creepy disturbing pilgrims/monks/priests and i look one in the eye and she starts jumping around and hittimg me lightly on the shoulder. She looks like your typical creepy ""oracle/fortune teller"" with eyes that are red at the sides of the eyeballs and a few bad and yellow teeth. There were more of them and they blocked our path, but i only remember one more face, the last one i saw. He wasnt creepy looking, but given the circumstances, he was creepy to me and at that moment, with the creepy fortuneteller hitting me, jumping around like a monkey and screaming jiberish i couldnt understand, i walk up to the last guy i remember and try to just pass through them, but they shove us back and i try again. At this point, the girl is terrified and squezing my hand very hard, but im still trying to act cool, even tho i was just about done using my shiting-my-pants pants. So we try to go through the crowd of pilgrims in front of us one last time and they push us back hard, start walking to us and suddenly we are surounded. At that point, i lost all ability to act cool and start panicking, but the last thing that happens is the last guy i remember comes up to us and says to me:""Now you are going to go sleep with her!"". Aaaand, thats when i wake up... Pretty crazy dream, the first one I could remember a big part of in a while. So, reddit, tell me what you think this means? I know dreams can be crazy but this was something else to me.. 

Id like to describe at least one of the pilgrims. The one i remember through fog looked like a human alien. Like one of those tall grey ones that you most often see but he was human so huge head and black eyes, veins all over his bald head and he was a tall dude, wearing some kind of purple and black robe like all of them but as far as I remember he was the only one that looked like that out of all of them, the rest looked like generic pilgrims that all wore the same robe as the tall grey alien looking dude.

At first, I was myself in a big school. It was lunch time or something that I brought the school's stove, that contains rice, to this certain place because I want to eat alone. What I do not know is that the place I am is the hangout area of 3 girls. So, when I was eating, when I heard someone tried to enter, I hid somewhere in the room but eventually, they found me. 

We had a talk and agreed to keep it secret and all; we even shared the rice I brought. At night time, they said I could sleep with them, so I did. Few days later, they invited me to a trip, I don't know where but we have a hotel to stay too. Two girls left us to do something, so I was alone with this one girl. And from that moment on, we start to get attach to each other and had sex. We even had sex when we returned from the trip. Every night, when we all sleep, both of us always had sex in the bathroom quietly. It felt real to be honest. 

After we slept together is this second dream. I am an anime character; specifically I am dreaming as Ryuji from Toradora, and that my girlfriend is Taiga. We were eating at this cafe and Taiga is being really cute to me that she even suggested that we do it on the table, and so we did. Hours later, we are in this tree, looking at the beautiful scene of the city. It's like we're having an intimate at that time. And of course we had sex. Before we slept together on the tree, she told me that she wants to do it with protection next time. Then when I woke up, something happened to the world, it has become more futuristic and Taiga is gone and nowhere to be found. So I went to town to buy some protection and tried to find her anywhere but couldn't. Eventually, I went back to the tree where we always used to be and there I found her. The tree aged fast too. She hugged me like she misses me and I do the same. Then, we talked about the things happened around us. After that, I opened the protection, but the protection looks robotic, that we didn't even use it. She told me that she wants a family, and so we had sex and I ejaculate inside her; it was vivid that it felt so real, even the way she hugs me while having sex. 

After that, I woke up. Kind of felt sad that I wish to continue it. (On the next dream if it's possible.)",1570259299.0

743,Grief Dreams/Processing Dreams. Dreamt of my brother again.,3,ddg3my,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/ddg3my/grief_dreamsprocessing_dreams_dreamt_of_my/,1,"I dreamt of my deceased brother again last night. I'm sharing in hopes of gaining perspective and coping skills.

Some context: he passed 16 yrs ago in a car accident at the age of 19. I'm 15 months older than him, it's fair to say we were close in age and that we had many of the same interest and many of the same friends.

Last night's dream wasn't too bad, I pulled it together pretty quick afterwords.

Sometimes when I dream and he's in it I wake convinced it was real, that he's alive. Then the whole world crashes in on me and I can't breath. The loss consumes me all over again. This is common around his birthday or the anniversary of the accident, or sometimes around big holidays like the 4th or Christmas. I suppose there's a nostalgia I get lost in around these times of the year. I actually enjoy the dreams, just not the tail spin I go threw when reality hits. 

It's not near any important or annual date right now. So last night was unexpected.

In last night's dream I was a teen again and my violent father had hurt someone horribly and they were missing. I was grilling my brother for details and he didn't want to give them up, didn't want to anger our father further. It felt so real. I woke missing him so much. The bitter sweet part was seeing his face and hearing his voice.

In one of the first dreams I had after his accident I was riding with him in his car, just driving around. Every time we came near where the accident happened he'd turn off onto another road. We never went by that spot. He was so upset. He asked me why everyone was ignoring him? Why no one answered the phone when he called? Why people where acting like they couldn't see him? He said even our grandma was acting that way. What had he done to deserve that? That I was the only one acting normal. I swear we drove around for hours. Finally, when we pulled up to a four way stop and the place of his accident was just up ahead out of view I told him no one was ignoring him, that we all loved him and missed him so much. I asked him why he kept turning and didn't drive forward. He said he didn't know why. I told him just ahead is where he had gotten in a horrible accident and there was nothing anyone could do and that he had passed. He was horrified, and then disappeared. Poof, gone from the car. I woke sobbing. It took me weeks to recover. And I told no one.

A few years ago I had a dream that felt so real. He found me and told me it was all fake, the accident and all of it. That he had witnessed something horrible and had to go into hiding. The accident and funeral was all faked to protect him. That it had finally all been resolved so he was free to return to his life. I couldn't believe it, but he had all this proof from the CIA & FBI, it was wild but there he was in the flesh. It was so exciting. A real miracle. I went with him to brake the news to our grandparents. It was amazing, the kind of thing that only happens on TV or in the movies. I actually woke believing it was all real for at least 5 minutes before I dropped by my bed, drowning in the reality that it was all a dream. Just deep sobs and unending tears. Again, I couldn't tell anyone, it just hurt too bad.

There has been a handful of dreams like the ones I've shared, the ones that feel as real as anything else in life. I don't know how to process those. How to find meaning in them. I'm often hopeful that there's messages in them or that they're from him. Mostly I think they're just undealt with grief.

A common thing in a lot of the dreams I've had with him is that he is silent. He will smile or nod, but will not speak. Sometimes it's so obvious that I'll even ask something like don't you have anything to say? He'll smile and shrug at that. Other times I won't realize to after I wake that he never actually spoke, that we fully conversated with me speaking and him using gestures.

I have a big fear of when the time comes that he's been gone longer than he was here. I'm not sure how I will process or work threw that. 

What can I do with these dreams? With the fall out? I feel like I have very little control or perspective, that I always tuck them away. I have a love/hate relationship with them, but would not rid myself of them if I could, I'd just process them and the fallout better. Is there a name for this? Is this common?",1570264082.0

My grandfather has been dead for over 7 years. I only met him a handful of times when I was a small kid, I am now 40 years old so I'm a bit confused only because the dream seemed as real as can be. 

My dream showed me standing next to my grandfather in his small ranch house next to a coral where he kept his sheep. He was just standing there with his old weathered flat cowboy hat and his crooked little smile, one of his eyes seemed to be a bit droopy. Although it seemed that he knew I was there he never acknowledged me.

We were standing there quiet just watching his sheep when a small white dirty baby lamb snuck out of the bottom of the coral door. My grandfather was quit to grab it but then the lamb snuck back out, this time the lamb managed to get out of the gate surrounding his house and although grandpa was just standing there not saying a word I had a feeling that he wanted me to go catch it for him. I walked outside the gate and the streets were completely empty and the lamb was nowhere to be seen. 

I walked up to the corner of his house where a street ran parallel and there was no sign of the little lamb, eventually my grandfather walked out and headed towards me just gazing but still ignoring that I was there and he never looked directly at me. He made a left turn and began to walk away from me although I wanted to follow him I couldn't do it, my feet wouldn't move. Out of nowhere  people appeared and began walking in his direction, I then started to walk away in an opposite dorection of him,  I then turned around just to see him one last time and when I did I noticed that there was a small child walking next to him. Idk who the child was or where they were headed and i couldn't tell whether it was a boy or girl. 

Next thing I know a small group of people began to walk next to me including a young man who kept talking to me but I couldn't understand a word he was saying, all I know is that he looked hopeful.  Shortly after I woke up.

Like i said, have no idea why I dreamt that I just figured I'd share my dream with you guys.",1570283102.0

So in this dream and it's the same girl from 2 dreams # 12 but we were in this tower and she was in this dress,

(So idk of anything else happened before or this is how the dreams started, though I thing I was walking in circles listening to music id remember though) so I was face to face with the girl and she had a knife and stabbed me in the heart,

So as she then yanked the knife from my heart I fell down to the ground holding the stab wound and as I saw blood coming from my heart I also saw blood coming from my eyes and then i looked at her as she was smirking at me and then I looked back to the ground,

But then i was then switched to seeing from her view and saw my self still down on all fours,

Then I looked up at her and my blood had turned pitch black and my eyes were pure black as I said,

""I have no heart""

And then rushed to her screaming in rage and her face turned from a smirk to complete horror as I then ended her, then my dream jump cut me to still walking in circles listening to music but this time me being angry.

There was another girl there who was staying and we both left as she texted on her cell-phone as we go up these airport stairs escalators. They were broad and wide open. As we go up, it felt as if I was in an airport or in the first floor of the shopping center. The entrance and exit was there on my left with other cashier places there. The place was massive like an airport. As I kept walking straight down the isles, the area had gotten darker, and darker and no light was shown to be.

This area was now blue and black that filtered each other brightly. The Rugrats had their own clones that those men looking characters made from the clouds. They were laughing and pointing fingers at the characters when they completely brought impaired and meet their clones that were soggy and droopy like looking. They weren't moving and just sitting as the other originals ran while they got raped by the clones. (To me, this part was more disgusting as I over-looked at it.).

He tried to take the child into his house which we were suddenly in front of; it was in a desert there was sand everywhere and a pale wooden door (similar to the sand village in Naruto). I wouldn't let him take her, so he tried to kill me using his shadow. But he missed, so I used my shadow to kill him while holding the child’s hands. (It was shown from behind us with our hands in center screen and my shadow stretched to cover the man and drag him through the ground screaming into hell). The child was in shock and awe at what I had done; she suddenly declared “I’m attached!” claiming me as her guardian. I was too. Then she explained that we would need to get out of there because the whole place and everyone in it was corrupt and the old man had many political ties, (it kinda reminded me of the episode of archer where they’re at the Mexican/American boarder).

How ever many times this repeats is called a ""layer"".

I wanted to open up a discussion for the best way to get out of these loops with less ""layers"" traversed and tactics to more quickly realize when you're in yet-another-dream rather than reality.

One thing that I've found helps is considering if you're in your actual house or bedroom when you wake up. I am often falsely waking up in a house or bedroom of the past or that I am otherwise familiar with, but not my own, yet do not make that logical connection quickly enough. They call this ""dream logic"" where something that would seem obviously irrational when awake somehow computes as rational within the dream. I've found that, upon lucidity, considering if this is my actual bedroom in my actual house helps me traverse the layers more quickly.",1570242943.0

So I was with twenty-ish guys all armed with curved swords for some reason, making our way up a flight of industrial stairs. Suddenly, half the people turned on us and a bloody fight ensued. In the end, only me and one enemy stood and, just as I felled him, he managed to slice my neck. We both fell down and I tried my best to stop the bleeding while the world turned black. I don't know how long I layed down, but at a certain point I had accepted the fact that I was going to die, and was just waiting for it to happen, only, at that point, I must had lost so much blood that bleeding had slowed down to a point where my hand still resting on the same position as when I had tried to stop the bleeding , was actually helping keeping me alive. I was just waiting for all of it to be over when I heard: ""This one I still alive! Bring a surgeon!""       
Being that I was, for some reason, in the Middle Ages, I wasn't exactly thrilled at the idea of a medieval surgeon trying to fix me up. I though I would still end up dead, but with added suffering. They started to fix me up, and it wasn't pleasant: I could not move nor see, but felt the blade of the knife slicing my skin to expose and suture the artery and the drill that, for some reason, was piercing my teeth. The surgeon actually saved me, but for some reason linked the thread from my neck, through my upper lip and a couple of teeth too.       
I came back home, in the modern world (dream logic) this time, only to be made fun of because of this thread hanging from my lip to my neck.      As I said it was really painful to experience, from the blade slicing my neck, to helplessly bleeding out and the dreadful wait for the surgeon to cut, but hey, he actually knew what he was doing!

I am sitting on a desk with my surroundings being gray and nothing else, only gray and a few specks of white particles that's either snow or dust.

I started talking about problems and finally engaging in a casual conversation, walking down alleys, sitting on a bench and even float for a second.

They are all men, and all had a knife or a weapon of come sort, and each of them had an intent to hurt or kill me. And they all seemed so sadistic, because they were smiling or laughing whenever I got hurt or was in pain or when I was slammed against a wall while fighting. Even my lizard, my male bearded dragon named Oscar, was lunging at the door to his cage, hissing and snapping at me angrily. I was able to lock him in his terrarium, but the guys were so persistent that the only way for me to survive was to kill them, one after the other as they appeared. They wouldn’t listen to what I said, as if I wasn’t speaking at all, or if they couldn’t hear me. I had to use the k-bar my parents gifted me for Christmas a few years ago to protect myself. After they were all dead, I walked out of the apartment and down the stairs, came to the stair-loft, and just couldn’t walk anymore. Just cut, bloody, bruised, and alone.

a man went through the hospital while we were visiting my mother, mass killing everyone.  
we knew of it first because of the elevator. 
it had a screen read that it had been stopped because of excessive blood in the shaft and elevator itself. 
while it was stopped, we ran. 
i pointed out the nearest exit and instead of waiting to find out what happened to my mom or anyone else, we ran to get out but didn’t make it.
he for whatever reason wanted to stop for some whack ass pudding shit that the hospital was giving away at this sample stand before we could get to the door. 
while we were grabbing that, a young girl ran to me from the top of the hospital stairs. 
she had short purple hair and one of those rainbow drug rugs on. 
she was my friend in the dream or something but i have no idea who she was. 
she asked me what our plan was to tell this killer when he got to us because he was questioning and killing everyone on site in this “zombie massacre” as she called it. 
we had no clue what we were gonna say. 
it was then that the hospital orderlies found us and filed us in a lobby area with the rest of everyone. 
my brother managed to meet up with us (i’m guessing he was already in the hospital when we got there) and was behind me. 
i had no idea what happened to my mom and was terrified for her. 
we were sat down in a line near the hospital window and the man came in, dressed in a tan trenchcoat, and looked at everyone. 
he walked to the front of the lobby area we were in and pulled each group of people (families that were together) forward. 
he would kill one member from each group as everyone else drank those protein ensures in a toast. 
finally.. it was us. 
he pulled my boyfriend, me, and my brother forward. 
he held a knife to my back as we all sat and my bf looked at me with that “i love you but dont say anything” look. 
he gave this whole rant before choosing one of us. 
while he did so, i began to make some sexual  comment or something about what his reasoning was for doing what he was doing because it was ridiculous and psychotic. 
he put his foot on my chest, looked to me and asked “what? are you a slave? a dirty little whore? begone slave.”
orderlies were yelling and screaming from the back and he for whatever reason looked to them
(mind you this was comical because the mass killer was a mixture of russell brand and dennis quaid). 
my bf managed to get him off of me and my bf headbutted the mask he was wearing, causing him to drop his knife, and the mask cracked into pieces all over the floor. 
the man sank down kind of vulnerable at first.

We were in a futuristic prison, but we didn’t realise (it was like Black Mirror episode 2 but only in vibes). I was seeing the situations through so many different eyes, but they were all working towards the same goal – escape.

At one point I had to fill out a survey, it was similar to a test in class and there was a woman there overseeing what we did. It was weird questions…. 

My friend and I got off a bus down my street and began to walk to mine. A dog started following us and I wanted to bring it home, it was small and white and fluffy. There was also another dog that already had a leash on it and my friend said somebody had claimed it. Then a car came, some other guy picked us up and told me to leave the dog. He took us home. The dogs were a part of our escape plan.

When we walked in the front room it had different couches. The test results were displayed on the wall behind us next to the door, I thought that I couldn’t judge this man's test result because I was forced to make kind of kinky videos about my socks.

We were being monitored. All the time, there was someone else was watching us…. I keep thinking of portal*.* It was like that, but we were all in different rooms/locations and had to solve pieces of the puzzle without being caught. 

A different me was sitting on computer in the front room and mum was next to me. She got up to do something so I quickly looked something up on her computer to help us with the escape, it would be underway soon. We just needed to bide our time for a bit longer. I was looking up videos of the patterns on the beach, the ripples in the sand, the lines engraved into rocks. I felt like I was in the waves, part of the ocean.

I should probably use an alt account instead of my art account, but I thought some might find this interesting.

The dream begins with me waking from my bed. I exit the curtain that surrounds the bed and look out the big window to the left of me. It’s dark outside with dim moonlight illuminating the area. I see outside glowing animal like dolls milling about. The fabric seemed to be of burlap sack in texture. They had large strings holding the body together but the creatures themselves ranged from guinea pig to cat sized. Upon seeing them I initially was confused, but then got a dreadful feeling. 

I exited my bedroom and went to the living room. Everything looked as it should. The air felt chilled as it does in winter. The living room has a whole wall of windows leading to a deck area and the entire lawn visible. I saw more of these multi colored voodoo animals moving around outside. Some in trees and some in the grass. Monkey, dog, lizard, and all sorts of animal shaped burlap creatures out in the dark. It seemed almost ritualistic.

I calmed assuming since I was in the house and they were outside I was safe. I turned to go tell the rest of the family when I saw a small lime green glowing stegosaur looking voodoo creature beside the backside of the couch.

There was a group of bad people.  Some of them were chasing little kids down a path with cars.  A dove with a blazing ring of fire swooped down in front of the pursuers and grew so much brighter.  This caused them to burn to a crisp.  The kids were saved and the burnt bodies remained, but not long after, exact copies of the killed assailants appeared to replace the dead ones.  As this was happening I ran back in the direction they chased the kids from.

There was a small property with a cabin.  I went into the cabin and there was a door with a hallway on the other side.  In the hallway you could either go to a door on the left which was a bathroom, or keep going to the end and turn the corner to a broader area where there was a house.  I ran past the bathroom, around the corner, and into the house, locking the door behind me.  My pursuers didn't find me but I felt threatened and intimidated because they were looking for me.  I found a cage in the house that had a couple geckos and a rat in it.  

For some reason I thought these were my pets, and I felt like I forgot about them for a year.  I tried to remember their names but couldn't.  The rat severely attacked one of the geckos, but I didn't try to stop it because I was scared of the rat shredding my hand.  I was angry at it and managed to grab it by the tail without it attacking me.  In contempt, I flung it across the room as hard as I could.  The gecko wasn't dead but it was pretty badly injured.  It had cuts all over and some of its top lip was missing.  

I removed it from the cage and desperately tried to find items to heal it. I kept getting delayed from finding anything, such as needing my teeth fixed by a dentist that randomly appeared.  I had a bad chip in my tooth that the dentist somehow didn't notice, but when I pointed it out to him he said he’d run out of time and left.  I came across my brother who had multiple cages of pets.

775,Back to the future?,1,ddcf6d,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/ddcf6d/back_to_the_future/,0,"Had a dream last night that took place some amount of time in the future, not sure how much further, but the remaining humans (myself included) are captured and end up in a huge spacecraft of some kind. It is dark and dingy and resembles a large warehouse or garage but with many different rooms and areas.

We are chased and attacked by the government officials in charge of whatever this was. People all around me are dying, getting shot, stabbed, thrown. I manage to find a decent hiding spot and stay there while I listen to hundreds of people scream and die. Funny side note: on the way to this hiding spot I see one of my birds, a gray cockatiel, that passed away years ago just siting in a large cage against a wall.

I stay in my hiding spot while debris hits me from all angles, covering my head with my arms. Finally after a while, a man fully covered in a dark suit finds me and I yell as I assume I’m dead next. He grabs me and yanks me away to a a separate, clean room. Everything is different. No killing, no screaming. Lots of other unharmed people. It looks like a cruise ship now. I don’t know what to think. Others are walking around, not happily, but safely.

I realize I was in some sort of process of elimination, survival of the fittest test, and only those remaining were to be chosen for whatever life this is next. There are windows to the outside now, a little bigger than airplane windows, and the ones who just entered this place are looking out wondering what is happening. I look too, and the world below is sad and bare. The average daily temperature is 200 degrees and uninhabitable to most life we are briefed. (Not sure where I was before this ordeal, some other barely livable place.)

I step away from the window and look around. There are many different kinds of people left which is surprising to me. Some look like they have been here for a while. I wonder how they all made it past their elimination round. I was not very proud of my way in so I already felt inadequate.

I make my way past the living area and into the community sleeping area. A man around my age (late 20s) points out an unoccupied bed that I can use as mine. The area resembles a detention center with small cot-like beds, the floors are still concrete as they were before, but you have everything you need to be just comfortable enough. I chat with this man and he seems nice and decent. He’s also attractive. I think to myself, whatever this is, it’s my life now and I hope I make it.

Obviously not really him but it was weird. And comforting. And incredibly embarrassing!!
 I'm missing a lot of what happened.

I've always had an issue with depression and suicidal ideation is something I struggle with daily (I got that handled though); since I discovered his shows, years ago, I've felt some kind of kinship with Anthony and he's big part of why I wanted to be an anthropologist at one point. 
His death *fucked* me up. 

ANYWAY. 

In the dream, he is very much dead but we are conversing nonstop over the phone while I'm sitting at a table in an empty/closing restaurant. Either chatting through text or otherwise. I end up leaving and I remember being outside of a taqueria-style food truck, its raining, and telling that ""I would rather you here"" or something along those lines. Now I have an SO that I love very much but shit took a sexual turn after that? But somehow... deeper and existential? I wish I could remember the conversation rather than the feelings. Like there was a spiritual connection that defied death. 

I have my own theories but if you made it this far, what is your interpretation?

It began with me and some close girl friend. We were travelling together, and I remember walking down the street of an English town and sitting on a small wall next to the sidewalk to have lunch. 

Then we got on a bus, it was still bright and sunny. All was fine and well until I realised that Sam Winchester was in the front passenger seat! So, we went over, and I sat next to him. Then I look into the review mirror and saw Dean Winchester was driving the bus!

*“wait, if the Winchesters are here doesn’t that mean something supernatural is going to happen?”*

BOOM! With that thought the buss starts swerving out of control. The sunlight is flickering, I get out of my seat and look through the front window. There are smudges of bright grey in stark contrast to the rest of the black road – I know exactly what they are. 

The angles (from Doctor Who), they’ve found me. I mustn't look in their eyes, but every now and then the swerving buss seems to freeze, and I stare directly into their cold stone eyes.

**BOOM!** Out go the lights, it was day time but now it is complete dark not a single star in the sky. Then just as suddenly the light is back. The bus still swerves, I can see flashes of their faces getting closer!

...We stop. The buss has come to a complete halt. There is an angle directly in front of us, it must have stopped the bus. I know I cannot take my eyes off of it or it will move but – 

**BOOM!** The light flicks off for a solid second then back on - Its moved. its closer, its coming closer. 

**BOOM!** Darkness, light. I tell everyone not to blink, don’t blink but no one will listen, no one can hear me-

**BOOM!** Darkness, light. Oh god it’s in the buss, it’s only a few feet away from me. I am alone, they’re all gone, where has everybody gone? Did the angels get them? They must have!

**BOOM!** Darkness, light. The angle is directly in front of me now, its arms outstretched and its elongated teeth out on display in a fearsome, frozen screech. 

**BOOM!** Darkness, light. Its moved away, back in front of the bus, but it’s not alone anymore. The other angles have arrived and I’m seeing this now from outside my body. 

**BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!** The light is flickering on and off, strobe lights, the angles are jolting into different positions. I am watching from a bird’s eye view looking down, it’s as if they are dancing around in a circle.

Forcefully a rift is torn right at the centre, time and space pull apart and an eye emerges (the Prison Guard's eye in Doctor Who S5). As it moves forward its long silver worm-like neck (Prisoner 0’s body) is slowly emerging from this portal and I am suddenly thrust back into my helpless body.

It is taller than the bus! Reaching far into the sky beyond the limits of the window frame. It brings its eye down, I try not to move so I don’t attract its attention but it knows where I am and stares directly into my soul. It creeps closer, reminding me of the angle who followed a similar path not too long ago.

I don’t know what it wants from me, but I don’t want it coming any closer. I’m afraid of what it might do.

I don’t want this anymore – *and so I wake myself up.*

*Startled, I realise that I am at home. Alone. it’s still dark. 3am. Now, I must now try to get back to sleep without envisioning the silver hand creeping out from the darkness as I close my eyes and leave my body entirely defenceless.*",1570219657.0

I was walking down a sidewalk near my school, I picked up a piece of paper and a red pen. I wrote something on the paper although i do not know what, only that i had the intention on cursing someone with misfortune or death. I continued t8 walk down the sidewalk until i cake across a trashcan. I threw away the pen and paper into the can and i turned to walk away. As i was turning i saw a short woman who was staring at me and gave me the most evil and twisted grin I ever saw, the kind of grin that makes your stomach turn. I saw her and i quickly walked back where i came from and into a building. The inside of the building was dark and there were isles of shelves (like in stores) that held toys and clothes that looked as if someone just threw them at the shelves. I went into one of the isles which were so close together only one person could go in at a time and it would still be tight, and i saw that woman. She looked about 5'4 in height and maybe about 20. She wore short shorts and a long sleeved sweater. When i walked into her in that isle she gave me some really creepy, evil, twisted smile and then challenged me to a sword fight with plastic katanas to see how fast i could hit her and she even shown me a paper that tells you a certain way to swing the plastic swords super fast. Then we began our duel in the messy, tight, old closet smelling isles in the dark building. She swung fast and hit me hard but i swung faster and hit her face repeatedly. All of a sudden it was like her face busted open and i mean it looked like someone stomped her head in. She covered her face and started sobbing. I looked at her and saw no blood nor fleshy bits. It looked like she was made of plastic on the inside and a voice box attached to a cord was hanging out of he face. I was so scared and confused. I asked her if she was ok but then she started screaming at me. Not the kind of screaming you'd hear from someone angry or the spoiled brat kind of scream, no it sounded like she was in pain, a ton of pain, it sounded like someone torturing her and she couldnt do anything. I tried to grab her arm and she did that horrible scream again and quickly ran away, hiding her face with plastic hanging out of it.Then i stood there shaken, confused, and scared.
The dream ended there when i woke up to the smell of bacon.

Also, she didnt look like plastic on the outside only the inside, she looked like a normal human outside.",1570204642.0

During the conversation we both hear a noise and look at each other then we hear the noise again and realise it’s gunshots and run to the kitchen, people start to follow and my brother being selfish tries to not let them in however I open the door and let them in. I’m sat in the corner with my brother under the counter when a quad bike starts to drive past slowly with the gunman looking through the windows. All of a sudden I notice the door in the hallway that leads outside is hatred open and race to shut it before the gunman returns locking the exterior kitchen door on the way, I’m racing to lock the door as he rides past and dive under the counter however we make eye contact. For some reason he doesn’t seem to be bothered about me and doesn’t try to enter the house unbeknownst to him the rest of the room is filled with most of the other people and we survive until morning. The next day we find out that he had killed 3 people when he got into the house upstairs, we also found out about a mass murder a mile away the same day we had been attacked at a horse racing meeting in the morning. we return home and that’s where the dream ended.

Krillin looked panicked, but I, Goku, waved him off. “I think I’m going to be fine.

I WAS TRPPED INSIDE THIS HOUSE AND HAD TO FIND A WAY TO ESCAPE

There was a cowardly lantern that was guiding me through the dream, and there was this girl whos face I cant remember. She helped me defeat all the monsters. The lantern was pretty shit at its job though because any time we faced a monster it would freak out and disappear. 

There was a boss lady witch outside trying to keep me captive in the house. Every time I managed to get outside, she would defeat me, and I would restart back in my room, at the furthest point away from the door, and need to re-battle against all of the monsters as we ought out way to the front door.

802,Strange dark dream,3,dd35uf,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/dd35uf/strange_dark_dream/,4," Somewhere that I recognized, I had been there before in a dream. Small building with a few rooms. Colourful bookshelves, some large red vending type machine. I stand next to it and see this small dragonfly, except it's not an insect. I look closer and it's a little drone, looking the vending machine up and down.

 I talk to someone with blonde hair, a man I know. I offer him some spare computer parts, but he says he appreciates what I gave him last time, and he's used all those parts, only now their operation is larger and he doesn't need anything I have. I don't know what they do. I remember giving him parts the last time I was there, but the place was more run down.

 There is a subway in the building with a hanging florescent sign nearby. It sways mechanically, with a camera on each end of the sign. But it hits the building swaying too far. It keeps hitting the building, making a banging sound that no one cares about. 

 In the same building. It's night time now, I'm looking in a room with three sleeping children, an infant, a toddler and a young child, sleeping in their bed with their father. Two men are sneaking into the room, im looking through the eyes of one of them. Or I am one of them, I'm not sure. One has a weapon drawn, pistol it looks like. Thoughts come to me ""obviously youngest to oldest"". One man shoots the infant in the head, it's almost silent, more like a paintball gun. A small coin like object hits and sticks to the infants head and I know it's dead. The toddler stirs and the man quickly shoots another coin onto his head. I know he's dead too. The older child lays quietly still sleeping and the man pulls the trigger point blank, except the device doesn't work. Nothing comes out, he fiddles with it momentarily and then tries again. It works and he kills the third child. He tries to shoot the father but the weapon stops working, or is out of ammunition. I'm not sure which, he can't get it working again. The father wakes up and realizes what has happened in an instant. I'm looking through the father's eyes now or I am him, but I know I have to kill the man with the gun. I grab him by the neck and choke him with all my might, feeling my fingers digging into his flesh and wrapping around his trachea. I know I'm going to kill him quickly but someone stops me. I immediately acknowledge that I should stop, and am directed out of the room. I discuss the happenings with someone I know, and recall that something similar happened with 'kaylas kids in that other reality' I'm referring to my wife kayla. I'm upset but maybe pretending to be upset because I should be? Then I wake up.

 I'm mostly disturbed by this dream because I have 2 young boys, an infant and a toddler. I am hesitant to tell my wife about it. Very uncomfortable feeling after waking from that.",1570196642.0

804,Multi-Level Dreams? - I had one that was FIVE LEVELS DEEP.,3,dd1057,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/dd1057/multilevel_dreams_i_had_one_that_was_five_levels/,10,"I'm wondering if others have had Multi-Level Dreams, and by that I mean a dream within a dream. 

When I was in college, probably influenced by inhaled herbs, I had a dream that was FIVE LEVELS DEEP. Though to be fair going up, that is going into the dreams, some of them were simply me in bed having another dream.

For example, in my level-1 dream, I dreamed I was laying in bed having my level-2 dream, an so on. On this particular night, that's how the sequence got started. I was laying in bed dreaming that I was laying in bed dreaming, and at each level I dreamed another dream up to Five Levels. Though this has been years ago, so all the dreams aren't clear any more, but in the last (5th) Level, myself and a nondescript person were trapped in an old log cabinet, and a posse of bad cowboys with guns on horses were approaching. We escaped out a secret trap door, went down to the river and escaped by river in a canoe just as the bad guys approached the Cabinet. 

Then I started falling down through the levels, Level-5 (cabin) fell into Level-4 then into Level-3 down until I was literally falling in Level-1. Just as I was about to hit the ground, or whatever surface I was falling toward, I woke up. 

Though mostly my dreams are just short flashed, more like passing thoughts, many times in my life I have had very long complex dreams. I remember one that started with me at a party in my Mother's house with the University Swim Team then transitioned to me driving on a road filled with huge pot-holes and after a lot more complex surreal insanity, ended with me practicing Karate in an invisible house. 

So - Multi-Level Dreams within Dreams? Anyone?",1570183839.0
805,Dreams & the Protection of St Benedict,2,dd38lb,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/dd38lb/dreams_the_protection_of_st_benedict/,0,"TL;DR Medel of Saint Benedict works in dreams, too.

I'm a lucid dreamer and usually have _at least_ a small measure of control over my dreams when I'm not just sitting back and watching them like a movie as they play out on their own. After my dad passed away a couple years ago, I immediately began having dreams with him in them, and they were almost always nightmarish. I haven't had a nightmare since I was five years old and discovered I had control of my dreams (haha, who's the Dream Master now, Freddy?!), so these dreams were, for me, extremely unusual and very disturbing, not the least due to their hellish content but because my usual powerset (see appendix) had no effect on them. Every time I went to sleep, I would dream about my dad, and every time he would die again and again but in a worse way than he actually had, or he would be suffering. In many of them I would try to fight back and assert control by saying outloud in the dreams that he didn't die like this, or that this dream character trying to convince me they were my dad actually was not. But no matter how much I tried to reassert control and fight back, it was all pointless because nothing worked. It got to the point where I would stay up later and later and would fight going to sleep because, once asleep, I didn't know what I would see or how bad it would be.

One of my coworkers and best friends is a devout Catholic. While I hold religious and spiritual views myself, I am not fully familiar with the ins and outs of Catholicism. One day at work, while apparently looking like the zombie I felt like, he asked me what was wrong and I told him about the dreams. Without blinking an eye, he reaches into his pocket, pulls out a medal, and hands it to me. ""Wear this on a chain or something. It needs to touch you. At least wear it to bed. It should help."" What he had given me was a medal of Saint Benedict, the patron Saint of Exorcism. On one side of the coin is an image of Benedict, and on the other is a seal consisting of the prayer of Saint Benedict. In short, think of it like a constant protection from evil and evil things, to paraphrase D&D. He explained to me that he thought the nightmares were demonic in origin and sounded very much like some _thing_ or _things_ had noticed the grief from the loss of my dad and were trying to capitalize in it through the bad dreams. He insisted that, if his theory was correct, I would know immediately.

I went home that night, exhausted after weeks of poor sleep and, wearing the medal on an old leather cord, I went to bad. I then had one of the first dreams with my dad since his passing where he was healthy and whole, and I knew beyond the shadow of a doubt that **this was my dad**. The dream consisted of someone knocking on my bedroom door, and on opening the door I found my dad _on the other side_. And don't think I fail to see the irony or the symbolism in that. He was young and healthy, looking as he did when I was a little kid. He hugged me and told me that he was OK, that I didn't have to have the bad dreams anymore, _don't sweat the small stuff, kid,_ and that everything was going to work out OK. He then told me that he had to go but he'd be back, and that he loved me. As he stepped back through the door, I woke up.

I told my coworker about the difference the next day and he firmly believed his theory was correct. He suggested that, if I wanted to go a step further, I could put a medal over each door leading into the house and they would block negative things from getting in. I then went to an Abby, bought a grip of Benedictine medals, had them blessed by a priest, and put them over the doors in my house, in my mom & dad's house, and put one on my keychain, and on my mom's. My sister wears hers like like a charm on a bracelet.

The bad dreams about my dad had stopped outright, but I found that I had then started having dreams instead about entities or demons trying to get in, but now I have I defense, and in every case I am able to cast them out without issue. These dreams are few and far between now, but they happen occasionally, and when they do I sometimes find them amusing, and then I fight back.

**Appendix**

Some background for reference: I'm a lucid dreamer, and I almost always have the same set of powers in any dreams. I'll list what those powers are for me and describe some of the terminology I will use in the above and future texts (I plan to write more about my dreams). There are rules and limitations for my dream abilities that I have discovered over 20 years. I don't know why these rules or limitations exist, or why they are similar to D&D rules (this was the case before I ever knew anything about D&D), they just are.

I have future posts planned and will place this section at the bottom of each one and add to it where necessary once I get into some heavier content.

**Rewind** to redo a scene, like in a movie.

**Fast Forward** to see how a scene will work out and then apply **Rewind**.

**Invisibility** requires minimal concentration, doesn't always last long.

**Incorporeality** or **Phasing** through walls or solid objects. Requires concentration, also a short term use ability, sometimes is combined with **Invisibility**.

**Possession** where I inhabit the body of a Dream Character, a character that is obviously not me, and play through their story from their perspective while influencing their actions but not with complete control of them or the dream. 

**Teleport** or **Jump** from one dream to the next. Moderate concentration, can lead to waking up. 

**Wake Up** is exactly what it implies: I can wake up at will if the SHTF and the dream is unrecoverable.

**Dream Characters** are _not_ me, I generally have _no_ control over them without using **Possession** (which is rare), they are their own persons and do what they want. Basic Dream Characters don't talk much, they tend to be like background NPCs much of the time. They can sometimes appear as someone I know, someone from a film, TV show, book, etc, but are still basically NPCs and aren't usually very active or smart and won't carry on a conversation no matter how much I try.

**Advanced Dream Characters** are still Dream Characters, but these are extremely intelligent and autonomous, like real people, and they don't happen often. I sometimes have interactions with them and have my doubts about them being Dream Characters at all, and they are all different. Sometimes I carry on conversations, exchange ideas, or even battle these people.",1570197151.0

Long story short, when I was around 11 I dreamt of my dad (whom I haven't seen since around 4) few days later, dead in a plane crash. Nothing to be alarmed, as a kid, I didn't think too much of it. Three years ago, dreamt of my grandmother, only to wake up and have my mom call with the news that she passed during the night. Mmmkay...
Last year, a good friend was diagnosed with cancer and I dreamt her only to find out that she died as well. 

All dreams were vivid but I had no control and I can still remember somewhat parts of it. I try to shake it off that stuff like this is not really something proven or accepted, keep telling myself that maybe it was a memory created after the facts but I told my gf what I dreamt before I got the call from my mom. It's been really bothering me and I know that stuff like this is probably not something that science is into, even talking about shit like this is most likely to be shaken off by someone with a decent understanding of scientific evidence and prof. I'll probably do if didn't experienced it. 

So before I start digging some shitposts and shady spiritual blogs, has anyone been thorough something similar? Not really interested in hearing that your gypsy grandmother was talking to the dead, but rather if anyone has something similar to share that they've experienced and they can't explain it. 

May also be interested in analysing whatever the hell this may be (no idea how yet) if I'm not the only odd fella.

So i get up and tell my dad (now I forgot some of what I said but I'll try to remember the best I can)

""Hey I think you need to do something about the foundation of the home""

I forgot some of the stuff after that but then what happens is that I get a very uneasy feeling and I see the bed start to move so I go outside to run away from it,

But then this girl come to me and I forgot exactly what happened but I immediately had this courage and I was then aware I was dreaming but j went back in the house and back in where the water was and when I was in the room I stood in front of the door frame and lifted my left hand as to bring the water up and out, but I stretched out my right hand to the bathroom where some light bulbs were unplugged and as there was the water spout I didn't want what was in the water to kill me so I put my right hand from the light sockets to the water spout as electricity came from the sockets to the water killing all in it and then the water flooded the room and everything went black,

""I have to go do something""

So in this dream I was in this car with this group and we had weapons and stuff and it was the zombie apocalypse (hey at least it wasn't another cod dream, though I do have around three I know of so far)

And after doing something which I forgot what it was, so we were running back to the car with some zombies chasing us but for some reason I couldn't run but walk so when I reached the car and opened the door for some reason I became lucid again and I remembered the last dream I had (2 dreams # 12) a what I did so i reached out my arm and as the zombie was right in front of me I focused really hard to kill it before it did me,

So as I'm trying to kill the zombie I freeze it and it cant move as long as my arm is stretched out to it, so after awhile I see my vision warm a bit as the place changes colors and after a bit of that I see its head twist but nothing else.

Then I wake up

""Aw i wish i had clones of me""

Then the same girl from 2 Dreams # 12 came in front of me and grabbed the back of my head and said ""why don't we make some?"" And then she kissed me and then it turned very awkward with the most cheesy music i have ever heard (the Hollywood love songs) and I'm in my mind trying to change the song (to twinkle twinkle little star) as I then see someone laughing at me and because of how awkward and cringey the whole situation just got.

The force of the impact destroyed the wall to my room, creating a giant gap to the outside. Dust and soil was kicked into the air. It was chaotic. The white wall was a giant flock of sheep. After plummeting to the ground they were now in a full on stampede. They were being pursued by wolves. Running to preserve their lives as the wolves chased them with tongues lolling out of their mouths. After a minute or two the sheep and wolves ran into the distance. The chase continued elsewhere and the dust began to settle. A lagging wolf approached me and entered my room through the gap. It had a visible wound on its right rear quarters. It lamely lunged at me. Perhaps thinking I would be easier to catch than sheep. After manuvering around it I grabbed the wolf under its throat with my left hand and pinned its back against the wall close to where the wall met the floor, so that the wolf was bent in an ""L"" like shape. Standing over it I gripped a knife with my right hand and plunged it into the wolf's neck, killing it.

But the water was the most amazing thing. Within the mist ran a huge river and the plane was flying down it, just 40 or 50 feet off the surface. The water was amazing. It had a strange viscosity to it and was the most incredible hues of blue, green, yellow and brown. 

I jumped out of the plane, angling my body with its velocity, pointing my toes. I plunged deep beneath the surface at a perfect angle. When I surfaced my skin was taught. I was young again, the age I am now. I swept my hair back and enjoyed a backstroke, a freestroke.

I stuck my right arm out and the alien morphed into a liquid state and propelled itself towards my arm, melting into my skin and giving it a strange look. I could hear it in my head as if telepathic. The longer the dream went on the more extreme the changes to my arm were. I had vines begin to come out of one small section of only that arm and into another. I was told I now have power over plants. Thus I aimed my arm at a tomato plant and concentrated, the tomato grew and the plant as well.

Another alien was located in a city type location, same thing, however this one was yellow and it gave me power over electricity with almost small mushroom like stalks extending from my should and upper arm, that would change location and grow depending on use.

I could see this almost like a HUD inventory from a video game when I wanted to know about them.

I never found the other aliens, and at the end of the dream I just basically pushed them from my arms with my hand very easily. Afterwords they died.

Then I woke up.

Why in the world did I dream this. I have never had dreams of aliens.",1570190633.0
824,Several strange dreams lately,1,dd24ls,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/dd24ls/several_strange_dreams_lately/,0,"I’ve suddenly started remembering my dreams very well and I’ve even been partly self-aware for some of them. They’ve become very realistic with just one weird element to most of them, and they are usually pretty short. Here’s four of the most prominent ones:

I’m driving into a parking lot, and I see two free spots: one beside Luigi and one beside Waluigi. I choose Luigi.

I’m just laying in my bed, a perfect recreation of my room and everything. I look at the time and it says 15:01, and I think to myself ‘it’s getting late and I should go to bed.’ The dream ends when I guess I went to bed.

A man I have never seen before is chasing me around my yard(another perfect recreation), trying to put a bug that resembles a green cockroach on me.

I’m reading an article on my phone about a music artist I like. It says, as close as I can remember, “She was very bold to name her album “Period.” Only two people have named their songs that before, one being [name I can’t remember] who got attacked by a fan, and the other being Oprah, who, not taking any crap, took out her gun and held it to the person who tried to attack her.” I read it and get a weird feeling, remembering that the artist the article was about did not have an album named “Period.”

825,Dreamt about my ex girlfriend,1,dd1p7f,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/dd1p7f/dreamt_about_my_ex_girlfriend/,0,"Girlfriend broke up with me 5 days ago. All I can do is think about her. Last night I dreamt that I was driving to school (I used to drive her with me, her house was on the way) and her and her brother were in her car driving at an intersection near her house. All of a sudden I get out of my car, decide to take the bus at the stop at that intersection to get to school, and so does she, but she avoids me completely. She sees me but she avoids me. The dream just ended there, but then I had another dream that I was Batman, she was my ex-wife, we had two kids, and planned on being with a new guy, who ended up being the bad guy in the dream. He planned on kidnapping her and the kids and living on a cruise ship. I put on the mask and a gray tuxedo and fought him at a giant party he was hosting in his huge mansion, she and kids were happy that they weren't getting kidnapped, and the dream ended. 

I've tried asking her to get back together, I know I messed up a lot but she absolutely refuses to give me another chance to fix everything. Can anyone analyze these dreams? Tell me what they mean? Make any comments about them?",1570187640.0
826,[Re-upload] I Threatened To Rape My Greatest Fear/Nightmare Gets interrupted by Lucid Dreaming MLG Memes,1,dd1ao0,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/dd1ao0/reupload_i_threatened_to_rape_my_greatest/,0,"[This is a re-upload of a very crazy bizarre set of dreams I had when I was younger, I uploaded it on the Lucid Dreaming subreddit almost a year ago. I took it down out of pure embarrassment as I didn't think it would get that much attention, someone uploaded it to the copypasta subreddit because of how shitposty it sounds, but here you go, enjoy] 

""So when I was younger I was afraid of those Heffalumps from Winnie the Pooh and kept having nightmares about it. That was until I learned about rape when I was 9, that really showed him! So basically the dream begins with me in a theater watching a play, don't know why, but I do. I suddenly realized I had homework and that this was bullshit. I then saw a Heffalump come towards me and opened his mouth to reveal sharp, jagged, bloody teeth. But then I said ""I'M GOING TO F**KING RAPE YOU!!!"". I chased him around the theater and he screamed like a bitch. I chased it up the walls, through the roof and finally when I got ahold of it, I woke up.

Another string of dreams that ended were ones that occured when I was about 12. I continuously dreamt about Winnie the Pooh characters dying and me getting blamed for it. That changed one night. Before I went to bed I watched MLG compilations (you can see where this is going). So I dreamt the same scenario but with a twist, it went something like this:

Rabbit: Oh God, Pooh, you're DEAD!!!

(Pans to de-fluffed Pooh)

Rabbit: It's YOU (Insert Name Here)!!! I'm gonna send you to jail for the rest of your life!!!

(Lucid realization begins)

(Rabbit runs towards me)

Me: S M O K E W E E D E V E R Y D A Y!

Rabbit: What did you just say?

Me: S M O K E W E E D E V E R Y D A Y

(MLG Sanic theme begins to play)

Me: (Does SM64 Backflip)

So I do a backflip and jump onto a Sanic, a crapton of memes shower across my view as I boost into each Winnie The Pooh character, making each one explode, I then encounter a Heffalump.

Me (Suddenly Terry Crews): FULL SPEED, POWEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEERRRRRR!!!!

(Purple Elephant dude (Heffalump) explodes)

The End

Weird stuff but i try not to go too into the rabbit hole and just take a dream for what it is... a dream 

But I'm coming here today to ask if anyone can add their input into a dream my grandmother had about me. 

Dream:

Last night she says she was in her previous house as her younger self, couldn't recall what she was doing but she knew she was at her old house. She then stepped out of the living room only to see my great grandmother (Her mother in law/now deceased) come through the front door carrying me (like a child thats is asleep) in her arms and started making her way upstairs. To which she completely broke down and started crying in the dream begging for her to let go of me. During the crying she added that my great grandmother had stopped on the 8th step (weirdly specific info) turned around for a minute and i had woken up and simply waved goodbye to my grandma and my great grandma just continued to go up the steps later into a room. She then ran after my great grandmother and tried going into the room only to wake up before she actually opened the door. 

Thats all haha, keep in mind as my grandma was her younger self she still saw me at my current age 

I don't know what to make of it, any input is appreciated

He acted so nonchalantly and at first I wasn't really bothered. I acted like everything was normal, but got increasingly stressed that he was gonna kill me next because I knew about the body. 

I tried looking up what to do on the internet by asking vague questions so that if he saw my search history, he wouldn't get worried that I was gonna out him (I was terrified that he would get out of prison and want revenge in the future). Strange enough, I came across a video specifically for this issue - it said to bring him to a group of people and shoot him ""accidentally"" whilst trying to shoot somebody who was gonna report him to the police.

I eventually decided on spraying my hands with his mother's perfume, bringing his clothes to his room and dropping some on the floor, giving the illusion that his mother discovered the body under his bed whilst picking up his washing.

833,You Keep Me Hangin' On: the truest dream,1,dczydx,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/dczydx/you_keep_me_hangin_on_the_truest_dream/,2,"I was hanging out with Tom Cruise after we both were somehow simultaneously retired from acting, characters in a movie, and also currently acting in a film shoot with no script. We had an argument in a coffeeshop where our lips weren't matching up. I think we knew we were in a dream, but that didn't make the film we were filming/living/notfilming any less real. 


I wanted to see what the movie was all about so I told Tom we would have to split and see which of us the ""camera"" followed. I think by ""camera"" I meant you, the audience of the dream. Not just me, timelighter the dreamer, but **you**, whoever you are.


I also realized I was a celebrity but I didn't recognize which one I was, so I had to figure that out. As I walked to my hot red sports car that sometimes flickered between convertible and not, I realized Tom Cruise was headed in a never-again-intersecting ray, and I would never see him again.


I went to my [timelighter's] apartment and was surprised by:

1. the mess of unfocusable items that maybe were blurry boxes of fuzzy things
2. The huge pile of bills and yellowed newspapers with dates that were always further in the past every time I checked
3. no lights or electricity or sunlight (even though it was daytime and the windows were open) except for one: the glow of my monitor, which was somehow a 90s CRT

4. my drunk landlord spilled out on the floor (who was someone I had never seen before)

5. an eviction notice

I read a few medical bills and realized they were all for my landlord, under my name. Except I couldn't remember my name so I'm not sure how I knew that this name was my name and not the landlord's.... except that... I think he had a key? Or it was a key card? Or was it a envelope? It's got something velvety... it's a keycard! Oh even better... 

it was an invitation to an exclusive party

ooh, party with celebrities! How nice... wait, aren't I a celebrity? Or just not yet? Not here?

Then I was sad because I realized Tom Cruise could not be there.

I helped prop up the drunk landlord up and then I *merged into his body*

I flipped the eviction notice around, which meant it was now only going to get me kicked out of here in the future, which can never be now

I knew I would see my apartment again when I woke up, but I was scared because I was convinced that the eviction notice was real, even though I knew I was dreaming

I decided to push aside my fears and powerwalk to this exclusive party.

I followed the invitation's pull and it lead me right to a industrial warehouse in the center of the city. Abandoned, I thought.

Until I walked in and realized **it was a metaphysical rave before an Industrial Motown Prog-Rock band playing a nonstop cover of [You Keep Me Hangin' On](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3bjMtqpGBw).**

There were no singers, just dancers and blocky mechanical instrumentalists. Imagine a Wall of Sound that pulses layers of ferrous awareness into you and your bodies, massive and unyielding and silly and **steady.** And somehow I could hear the words. 

And everyone was into it. And it was the truest shit I'd ever heard or seen.

And the air smelled like rubber shoes....

I won't describe the ravers to you, because it was very special and you have both be invited, steal an invitation, and just wander in. It was a wonderful mindless ****physical**** dance party, bodies supremely focused on The Beat, almost like zombies eating rhythms instead of brains. 

Time must have frozen, because it felt like dozens of hours had passed while watched the ravers. There was a perpetual, unstoppable, redundantly smooth ""smoothness"" to the way time was flowing. 

Everybody was a unit. They were probably all the same person, spiritually. Nobody talked; everybody just danced, individual limbs on a single breathing beast. Except... I was a moving part... I could cross-swim my dance moves through the crowd... I had to search for Tom after all! I would never see him again, but somehow I knew he was there. And so I swam on.

You should wake up now and *stop reading this*. It's only secret info from here on.


I will say this: I both did and didn't find him. Tomboy, that is. You see... it turned out that *I* was actually Tom Cruise, who the camera had followed. I was also timelighter. And sometimes I was Woody Harrelson. It didn't really matter. ***We just danced.***

Eventually my active memory ceased (my theory is that this dream leaked out of REM and into deep sleep) and my memories of the rave coming to an end would only come back to me later, immediately upon waking. (And even then it started to desaturate and clump the ""smoothness"" of events, causing me to forg-edit details)

And then I had the full revelation: ***I wasn't dreaming. **** I was actually a dead person, one who had lost their personal name as all who were are now have done. Yes, I did think that phrase and yes, it can make sense.

All the ravers were dead. Our long night was done and we were burying ourselves back into whatever grave felt most right. Some'day' somehow we'd be back up and raving again, and I would have my One Day of thinking I was some guy that was just alive and dreaming he was tom cruising instead of an anonymous spirit slurping his taste of excess lifesauce off my brain's nocturnal emissions.

Somehow this all made perfect sense.

The whole point of humanity is to spontaneously generate tasty art nuggets in our sleep. Dreaming and dying are obverse and reverse, life is the rare coin-on-its-edge.

Anyways:

I have a weird vivid memory of stubbering like a zombie in the crowd, closing in on Lakewood Cemetery, and someone somehow somewhere still humming.... *keeep me haaaangin' oooooon*

I wake up in the same class but this was in 2018. We were doing an assignment that I knew I've doe before, I was sitting at the front now, and I get up and I start telling the teacher that I've been here before, I came from the future, September 2nd 2019.

It was ""Happy Hour"" and we sat at a table then ordered.

As we talked, my girlfriend and I began to feel a sense of unease when she pointed at another female looking at us.  

""Why is she looking at you like that?"" my lover said.

""I don't know.  I'll ask.""  I said back.

I approached the table where the other female was sitting at.  She was wearing a garden mask that covered the lower part of her face and immediately revealed herself.

She was a female who I had a crush on when we were in grade school and middle school together.  (Let's call her ""Jenny"" just to be clear)  She looked at me without saying anything but gestured at me to sit across from her.  She was wearing nothing more than a swimsuit that of course bared her abdomen and navel in a sexually suggestive manner.

I obliged.  We began engaging in conversation, but I insisted I needed to get back to where my girlfriend and I were sitting, but ""Jenny"" demanded I stay with her.  I did not oblige without saying anything.

After we left the restaurant, my girlfriend and I boarded a bus and we consoled each other.  She asked me who ""Jenny"" was and I explained.

""She was one of the popular girls and I was one of the fat kids who didn't fit in very well.  I was often bullied, but sometimes she broke character and told bullies to leave me alone.  Her charm easily convinced bullies that bullying was not worth it.  However the ironic part was that whenever she broke character, it pissed off other popular girls she hung out with.""

In reality, ""Jenny"" works in the dental field, got married just last year, and now has three children.  In fact, when she had her first sexual encounter at the age of 16, she unexpectedly got pregnant.  This of course shocked everyone.

My boyfriend and I had met in 2013 and dated for a few months and broke up, nothing serious. Just different places in life. He encouraged me to remain friends with his friends group because we all really clicked. 

I did! Established my place in the group and everything is awesome. When friends found out we’d broken up a couple of the guys were interested in pursuing me. 

There was one I was attracted to - J. We hung out a few times (brunch and hanging out at his apartment, playing video games or watching shows) but he never made a move. Things sort of fizzled out before they really even got started. (He told one of the gals in our friends group that he didn’t want to corrupt me and he felt I was too sweet and innocent - she told me this a while after the fact out of the blue)

Boyfriend and I randomly rekindled things mid-late 2015 and moved in together first part of 2016. He had a roommate already, but he moved out summer/fall 2018 and we asked J to move in with us. He did and he’s an awesome roommate!

I see a lot of people running towards me, as I said before I was in a modern era, I was in a kind of giant city with walls, those people who came running to my house were  soldiers, then remember that in my world everyone was at war, and for some reason I had my giant skeleton-shaped giant self and that I could completely control it like in that movie of giant boxing robots, well the fact is that that giant I had a sword and I controlled it, so my whole family and the pubel asked me to protect them, defending them from so many soldiers, they didn't give up, since they came day by day, I think it had been 5 days, and on the third I see that giants made of trees begin to arrive but were alive, I continued fighting against them although some managed to enter and had soldiers burned some parts of the city but in my world there were firefighters who went and turned them off, long after I found with the king after surviving the 5 days and that king who was very old, very similar to my grandmother he tells me, that he had a crystal to give me, a crystal that I should take to the forest (I forgot to say that forest was on another island far away from the cities) that crystal, according to what I was going to wake up, asked him to wake up from what? He didn't answer me, he just sent me there, I realized  that my skeleton was no longer with me, so I went there in a car, when I got used to using a sword for a few days I was not complicated to defend myself from them until there were many at one time and being at night at that time I I noticed by his bright eyes almost of ghosts, when I ran from them I found a well with a vacuum and although I tried nothing more than to jump over it, being just above something emerged from my back and shot out, it was the same child who I counted in the town I had disappeared, when I saw it I was surprised because I had realized that it was my past self, my chubby self, then I hugged him and he asked me where I was, I said you will not know me but accompany me, the two together we ran more into the forest where we saw a large cave with lots of pillars and sculptures of giant skeletons,  when we walked inside we found something that really made me very sad ... he said that this world would be completely destroyed, if I laid the stone ... I began to tear through my eyes when I receive a call ... a call from my grandmother That told me not to look behind everything that happened in my dream, that this is a dream and that I can see it again in real life, but I could not ... I was too sad because I also shared a lot of things in my dream and although I knew it was a dream I could not destroy it and she told me that I had to do it to wake up, at that moment I cut myself, and my past self hugged me tightly and told me, ""You must do it"", I crying I told him that I was going to do it, when I laid the stone I said ""Love this world, thank you for letting me be someone very dear"" after putting it on and that the pillar where I should put it began to shine, everything starts to shake and my self told me ""We will miss you"". After that I woke up in my bed and although I had not cried I prepared to do it after waking up, I realized that I woke up at 4 in the afternoon, and I had slept last night at 12, this I write within minutes of waking up If you are still here I would also like to say that I love Berserk and the first manga that I bought, just the main character fought with a lot of skeletons, which perhaps had something to do with my dream, but that is the whole story.

849,I keep having dreams where I have Pica,2,dcs6zl,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/dcs6zl/i_keep_having_dreams_where_i_have_pica/,2,"Oh hey everyone first post here. I always liked the idea of sharing dreams with people. Here it goes...

&#x200B;

Well I keep having dreams where I have Pica. You know, the eating disorder where someone constantly snacks on inedible things like drywall or hair. I don't actually have Pica in real life and I don't think I can ever truly understand how it feels.

&#x200B;

The first dream this occurred, I couldn't stop eating smartphones. Like the entire dream played out like it normally would except I just had like this tray of smartphones that I kept grabbing from and snacking on them like cookies.  I just remember loving the crunch of the broken glass flying everywhere and thinking battery fluidy insides were delicious. Eventually after eating like a dozen of them I got a really bad stomach ache and became really dizzy, probably from internal bleeding. I fell over unconscious and woke up in the real world.

&#x200B;

I know I've had several of these the past couple weeks, I just don't really remember what I was eating in them. This is probably why I should form a habit of writing in a dream journal. I think the last one I had I kept eating newspapers. 

&#x200B;

My dreams are almost always weird as fuck but also very beautiful. Weird shit happening is a common occurrence, and neither me or any of the denizens of my dreams usually bat an eye of these things, but they do actually see my eating habits as a little bit strange for some reason. Usually they'll stop mid conversation and be like ""Um why are you eating that?"" and I'll tell them its because it tastes delicious and they'll usually be like ""Uh alright then...."" and carry on talking or whatever they were doing, allowing me to continue consuming my delicious weird shit.

851,Recurring meta-nightmare of not being able to wake up,1,dcv4nj,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/dcv4nj/recurring_metanightmare_of_not_being_able_to_wake/,0,"I will start this by saying that my psychiatrist has said that I sleep far too much.  Where a normal person sleeps 6-8 hours a night, 8 hours is my minimum and even if I have slept eight hours during the night, I can still nap during the day for anywhere from 30 minutes to 2 hours, and occasionally I sleep the whole day away (that last bit is usually because of depression, as I have manic depression).

So, this is a nightmare that has occurred once a month, and I first started having this nightmare in senior year of high school, and I am now 24 y.o. and graduated undergrad in 2017.

The reason I say ""meta-nightmare"" is because the actual dream that occurs is different every time, as in the events, but the theme is always the same.

In these nightmares, I am always struggling to wake up.  I desperately want to awaken but my body keeps falling back into sleep, and I fight a losing war to wake up (in the dream). I had one just today that went like this:

I was taking a nap on my bed, and my mom comes home. I wrestle myself out of my bed to talk to her, but I keep falling back asleep. I even turned on my laptop just to mess around in Skyrim, but I kept falling back asleep. I sort of limp towards my mom in the living room and ask her to help me. She sits me down next to the security television, and then gives me her chai (Indian milk tea that has a lot of caffeine). I try to drink it, I try to pour it down my throat, but I can't. It's just impossible to drink the coffee and wake up. I beg my mom, screaming for her to help me, and she says she can't and she gives up. I start panicking as I feel sleep trying to overcome me again, and this time I succumb for good.  It is then that I wake up in the real world with heavy breathing, panting, and panic.

For added context:

1) I have had problems with my sleep cycle since sophomore year of high school. I would often sleep at least a little bit in every class except for my very last two of the day, and sometimes those too. But, I never went to the doctor about this, because I am pretty god dang smart and I was able to get really high grades (90+) in virtually all of my classes, and I got high AP test scores too (5/5 in AP Calculus AB, despite the fact that I slept in that class almost every single day), I still had a decent social life (as much as my uber-strict Indian parents would allow, that is), I still saw therapy.

2) I am a tabletop game designer, aspiring author working on a high fantasy novel, and aspiring videogame designer/entrepreneur. A lot of my inspiration for things in my games and books come from the dreams I have that I easily remember when I wake up. Several of my tabletop game's campaigns are based on dreams I had. Themes in my books are based off of dreams.  The sort of cultural theme/fit of my novel worlds are based on dreams. Hell, the idea for my novels' stories were from daydreaming/ as a creative outlet while being bullied in middle school/high school, but what helped me really shape them as unique, breathing worlds were the myriad of dreams I would have that I would remember.

3) I also have bipolar disorder (manic depression) as I have mentioned.

4) I do have some symptoms of PTSD according to my current therapist.

5) I am overweight, with asthma and allergies (currently I am in my allergy season, and my sinuses are always at least somewhat stuffed).

I am not sure, how much the last one has to do with this, but I think it might have something. If there's anything else someone wants to ask, that's not unreasonable, please ask.",1570156923.0

After avoiding death a few times, I wound up outside. I was surviving with a girl I'd just met, we were both scared shitless. She then was abducted and thrown into a vehicle which drove off. I called 911, but the operator seemed distracted, and eventually the call just ended out of the blue.

It was then that someone started coming at me with a pipe. I killed him with that pipe after maneuvering around his swinging. After killing a few more people, the sky clicked for a moment, like all time had briefly paused. Every electronic around me with a screen then began broadcasting something, but I turned away. When I refused to watch, every phone everywhere began ringing maniacally, then they all went to speaker mode and said simultaneously, ""WE HAVE OUR WINNER. PLEASE GIVE A WARM ROUND OF APPLAUSE FOR *crackle* *I don't want to play this anymore...**crackle*""

It was my mother's voice. She sounded so incredibly tired.

After that, everyone, including me, completely changed moods. We were all smiling, greeting each other, laughing, hugging, talking about how grand life has been. After our brief moment of happiness, we began killing each other again, only it was now voluntarily and done with a smile on our faces, like we had all accomplished something great together by making it to the end. I was killed by Margo Martindale. She was so pleasant as she drove a butcher's knife into my chest.",1570115672.0

Not sure how I got to this part of my dream but there was a part where I was in a bath with my mom, and there were two babies in the bath with us, I'm pretty sure they were twins. I mentioned something to my mom about the babies, she had a look of shock on her face and then she started frantically looking around in the tub. There was one baby in front of me so I pulled it out from underwater and there was another baby to my side that I had to do the same with.

It honestly is one of the most vivid dream I’ve had in years. It felt so realistic. 

Basically, I live in Bermuda, where experiencing a hurricane (during the season) is normal. I was at my grandmas house with most of my intermediate family (like 10 of us), riding out the storm. It wasn’t the “worst of it” yet, as it still had time to get to its closest point. We were all in the living room just watching the news, chilling etc. It was just really rainy and windy. 

As time went on, the weather was deteriorating. Still we were okay because it was something we know how to handle. Videos then started to be sent to our phones of people’s houses being destroyed by tornadoes. I remember my brother showing me one of the videos and then the house started shake violently. (Context: Although I’ve experienced a good deal of hurricanes, I’ve never experienced a earthquake before). It probably lasted about a minute. But it was the worst thing to experience since it was also a hurricane outside! 

Everyone was okay, just a few things knocked off the edge. We tried looking outside (dont know why), but we could barely see anything since there was a lot of salt spray from the ocean on the windows (a normal thing). 

Now for the weird, fucked up part (that I can’t unsee). We could see a figure walking towards our front door. The person knocks, a few times. We want to stay quiet because we were all scared. He speaks just to say “ya’ll stay safe now”. And then we see him walk away. Let me remind you, there’s a full hurricane outside, wind, rain, tornadoes etc. 

Everyone goes back to the living room, talking about the earthquake happening. I was looking at Instagram, watching a friend’s story about her reaction to the earthquake, when suddenly there was a orange light, then a huge “explosion” (in the sense of the house shaking again, and the loud noise). 

All the lights and our phones went completely dark. I honestly thought I had died. But when we checked to see if everyone was ok, we checked outside the window. The sky was completely blue. The sun was shining bright, looked a lot closer than normal. Hurricane was gone. But now there was fire. Everything was on fire. It felt like I entered hell with all of my family. My grandma started praying, and when she finished, my stepdad said “have fun”. 

I jolted awake. Its early in the morning, and yet I feel rested and don’t feel the need to fall asleep again.  Usually I’d go back to sleep but, I don’t really need to.",1570134186.0

The forest was very woodsy but not much else to see except for darkness. We keep running until we get to this open spot with a trap door type thing on the floor. One of them opens it and there’s a basement room kinda thing???? With broken glass and bones all scattered on the floor but there isn’t much else to see because of how dark it was. There was a small wooden table in the center of the room though. One by one, they all jumped into the room but for some reason I kept thinking in my mind,(it’s a trap she’s trying to trap us) but at the same time I didn’t know who “she” was??? So I was very reluctant to jump in but I finally did after I saw someone in the woods. After I jumped in, I blacked out. I then wake up again in a small wooden cabin during the day. When I say it’s small, it’s SMALL. Like a single room with little walking space. The room seems very grey and with no color. When I looked around all I saw were sigils. All scratched on the floor and walls.  There was a small staircase that led to a wooden door. Across from the door was a rocking chair facing the corner of the room and a black figure with very long hair that draped over the back of the rocking chair. As soon as I saw her, I ran as fast I could toward the door and I got out into the woods. It was the same woods, but during the day. I turned around and the house was gone. No where to be seen. I then blacked out again. I wake up again but this time I’m in a black room with nothing but a woman’s face breathing distance away. She looked normal but her whole face was distorted. Her left eye was on her forehead and her right was on her cheek. Her mouth was near her left ear and her nose was curving toward the right side. Her eyes were also glazed over. She just stared at me for a good few minutes until I hear whispers. I heard what sounded like at least thirty people whisper to me at once “Feed them bones” in my ear. It was so loud even now I think it was real. After that my vision started to fade again. I woke up in a car this time in the back seat with two unknown people in the front driving. They are talking but I don’t remember what about. Their trunk was packed to the brim and you couldn’t see out the back window. They kept driving down this empty back road until we get to this small parking lot in the middle of no where. They start rushing like it’s the end of the world and grab stuff from the trunk and take it into the woods. I don’t know why but I do the same as them and I grab as much of the junk as I can and run into the woods. As I soon as I pass the tree line I loose them. For some reason I just kept calling out their names but they were no where to be seen. And once again I fade out. Finally, I’m phased into me baking but I’m very stressed and panicked. I’m baking bread but I feel like if I don’t do it right I will die. I’m baking it normally but then I take a bowl of crushed up bone shards and put them in with the dough. Once the bread is done I feel very relieved and I start to cut the bread up and serve it to random people on the street. As I’m doing this I hear the same whispers again. After I hear the whispers I wake up VERY scared and sweaty. I still heard the whispers for a few seconds after I woke up. Weird thing is I woke up at 3:00 AM. After that I stayed up till about 6:30 or 7. I was basically waiting for the sun to come up.",1570136688.0

Now, I should note that in my experience, stating ""this is a dream"" or similar out loud causes lucid dreams to become unstable, and those were the first words out of my mouth in this dream.

Anyway, moving on. I became lucid by noticing a plot hole (some characters were both real and fictional), and then went onto the boardwalk to have fun, all excited that this was the most vivid I ever felt in a dream... But the dream became unstable before I could even do anything.

Like, my previously normal consciousness became hazy again (as in the phenomenon that makes dreams feel like a distant memory rather than something that really happened) and I instantly realized my mistake.

Suddenly, I was literally dragged into the air. I quickly grabbed onto the boardwalk railing to keep myself grounded. I repeated ""concentrate"" to myself, as this was a mental battle as well as a physical one.

I was eventually dragged into a black void anyway, as if I hadn't been holding on to the railing. I was in a sort of limbo state, floating to nowhere, but I knew I was floating up. I still tried to fight to keep myself asleep, but that didn't work. I became aware of my surroundings, and I woke up.

I still think about this from time to time. It was not a normal lucid dream, as I usually wake up on the spot. Like, I know exactly why my dream became unstable, but what was with that whole mental battle I lost, and what was with me literally being dragged up through a black void before waking up?

But last nights were more intense than I've experienced for a couple months. For context IRL I'm happily married.
This will also be in sections as I woke up and than fell back to sleep. 

First I'm standing in the center of a wasteland village it's dark. I haven't seen anyone else but I sense danger. I try to navigate my way to safety but I feel my body growing weak and realize the dream is holding me back. I use lucidity to will myself forward focusing on a hut nearby with a lantern lit out front. I am able to enter the hut. 

Suddenly I'm in daylight, around me are thousands of people, colorful lights, and sounds. I'm with people I don't know, we are eating fried chicken while walking. This part is hard to remember and very brief.

That ends and I'm back in that wasteland, I go to a home there that I know to be mine. The home is small and has little curb appeal but there is still a sense of whimsy. I go to bed with my spouse.  After sleeping for a couple hours we are awoken, someone has broken in. We move to the bathroom and my spouse refuses to hide, I use my lucidity to hide behind the shower curtain and when the intruder enters and tries to attack my lover I strike first from stealth. He is taken prisoner.

Next I've moved the intruder into our kitchen. The dream house is now luxurious,  high end finishes, it's bigger on the inside than I saw  walking up, we have butlers and anything our hearts desire... I realize I know his energy he's a scorned lover from my past someone I dated for less than a year. I have a soft spot for him I try to talk him down from his anger towards me and my spouse. I start to cook him a steak, everything is starting to calm down. Than I hear sirens. I can't finish cooking the steak, so I send him away with it in a plastic bag. I am upset he tried to hurt us but I feel like he is no threat. I escort him through a marble hallway and past our security gate. I see him walk away but I get a sinister feeling he isn't done yet. The doors have a stupid locking system that you must time perfectly with a pinhole key as they slide open and closed. I have to do this twice on two doors to fully lock the security. I fail on the last keyhole and am knocked out from behind. 

I wake up IRL adrenaline pumping through me, very visually disoriented, and frozen. I have been through this before so I collect myself. I wake my spouse and ask him to check the house, everything is alright and we go back to sleep. 

Now I'm at a picnic table with some friends, my chest starts to hurt. For some reason instead of just asking for help or seeking medicine I cough harder, HARDER until I dislodge my heart and hold it in my hands. My heart is small but it looks healthy and vibrant. I feel no pain or panic. I even show some of the friends around me the heart I'm holding in my hands. Some I know wouldn't believe without proof. 

Than I swallow it back down, it's so large I nearly choke but   I manage.... Somehow.

It's later in the evening and we've all had good drink and food we are laughing and conversing and there are now several rows of friends and family. Suddenly I feel a tap on the shoulder. I know instantly that this is the first man I loved. Whom I had spent 4 years with returned from the military. I turn to face him and he has tears in his eyes, he feels regret about the messy breakup we had and he wishes I had waited for him to make up his mind. 

( I had broken his heart by being unfaithful during a mental health crisis I deeply regret, and had no meaning to me. I've since learned to control with medication and therapy .)

 I embrace him and tell him I've been waiting a long time to know he wanted me too. Than we leave everything behind, together.

I’m somewhere (usually at home but in my dream last night this took place at a hotel) going about my day when all of a sudden I look at my front door randomly and there’s these black figures. I can’t see their face or anything, they’re almost two dimensional. Extremely skinny and very tall. And in the dream last night there was a rainbow stone light flashing behind them. They watch/stalk by looking through front doors.
For the rest of the dream I’m essentially just spending the rest of the day being mindful of if they’re around or not and hiding. 

If this is just a random weird dream with no meaning, then ignore this, but if it might have meaning please let me know! I’ve dreamt this 2/3 times in the past two weeks or so.",1570132292.0

I was in some town that looked like a mix between the Old West and a village. I remember being with a family I personally didn't recognize and suddenly, well, boom.

I saw a white light, the explosion... it looked like it was far away. But I was still standing around. I remember standing on a small board ramp, just... frozen and staring at the explosion. I remember my mother (she had dark skin and black hair, IRL I'm white) running up to me and trying to shake me, but I just kept staring at the explosion.

It was like I was invisible to her, and all I could feel was this growing heat on my skin. It just kept getting hotter and hotter, and I remember thinking about a shockwave (if it ever hit) and everything just went black. I wasn't really panicking, I was just... distant. Staring blankly at the explosion as my mom tried shaking me or getting my attention, and it was like I wasn't even there.

I personally don't consider it a nightmare. Again, all I could remember is the heat on my arms slowly becoming a painful burning sensation.",1570123891.0

I was driving two people and my dog in my car on a sunny day in a warm environment near the ocean. We were going on a road I remembered taking to pick them up, and knew there was a steep turn to be wary of. The road looked different this time and was much steeper and the water much higher but we were too far on the road to turn around, so the car rolled into the ocean.

Understandably, we were all trying to swim the car back to the flatter part of the road, and eventually we got there. We were all okay and so was the car.

Something bad has happened to me prior but I don’t remember what. For some reason, my new family and I go to a movie or show of some kind in a theater and something ends up happening and my parents and I have to be escorted out of the place through a secret passageway. But in this passageway has separate rooms. The evil people with guns follow us and while I’m looking through this one room with parts of cars that just contain one or two seats (I’m checking them for bombs) they kill my parents? (that part is foggy). But I wake up in a Jigsaw type situation. But I’m not competing to save anyone else’s life, just my own. But I’m competing against 2 other people and for some reason, only one of us can leave. I get through the first couple of obstacles and so does my opponents. And when we get to the big event It’s a speed course, if we do something wrong we will be poisoned or something. I, for some reason, have been through this before. I get through the first couple of problems but keep messing up and have to start over. Soon this person my age catches up to me and is hell-bent on finishing this thing before me so she can get out first. I am freaking out but I have been through this before. It starts out as a test of speed for both of us who can finish all of the things first. Then I realize that I’m not fast enough and I’ll have to outwit them. So I try to get to the obstacle that has the person douse their nails in poison (I don’t remember why) thinking I can just scratch her and paralyzed her than speed through the course. But because they for some reason are invincible or immune to poison it doesn’t work. So I pretend to scratch myself and become paralyzed. They see that I’m “paralyzed” and attempt to drown me in some kind of magic pond. But once they tough the pond they lose their invincibility. I pretend that I died and they walk back to the course to finish it. But I sneak up behind them and scratch them with my poison covered nails and I guess I was so aggressive that instead of paralyzing them it slowly kills them. But the only reason that I knew this was because while I was struggling through a puzzle they died. Anyways the other person that entered this went insane shortly into this shit show. When this person dies The Man comes out and informed me that I have won but to leave (the insane person has brought back a car and he turns out to be my adopted sibling) I have to leave my sibling here. I don’t know if my sibling goes through this hell loop again or is they die here but I for some reason feel like leaving them there is the right choice. I know if I leave them there The Man will cure his insanity and my sibling will manage to get out. I then start the drive back to my new parent’s house before I wake up and have to write this at 6:30 am. 

This is all very choppy due to the fact I tried to type it all out before I forgot it. I can attempt to answer some little details if y'all have any questions. I'm just curious what others think of this.",1570133644.0

She kinda shrugged it off and I continued to seize in and out of consciousness while my jaw was clenched super hard. I like half woke up and my jaw hurt and was also clenched in reality and then I just turned to my other side and I was fine.

 It was really weird and unsettling because I couldn’t distinguish the dream from reality because in the dream I was in the same place, position, setting, etc. as I was when I fell asleep. I don’t have a history of seizures, I had one when I was a baby but that’s it. I’ve been under a  lot of stress lately and my mental state is shooting downward so that could have something to do with it?

You know those dreams that when you wake up you are super confused because you had no idea you were dreaming. I felt like I had complete control of my actions but didn't know I was dreaming, like a semi lucid dream.

I am sure this sub has a lot of ""I dreamed about my friend and now I have a crush on them post"" but I promise this post isn't like that, and I do not have a crush on my friend. 

So last night in my dream I got a text from my friend and she said she would like to go out on a date (Let's call her Ella for the purpose of this post). In real life me and Ella are friends, we have known eachother for the better part of a decade and are pretty close, but she goes to school abroad and we don't see each other often, we also have a lot of mutual friends and whatnot, it has never been an intimate situation and I have never had feelings for Ella, true honest to god friends. (If your one of the dudes that don't believe guys and girls can't ""just"" be friends you can pop out now, your useless to me) 

In the dream it was very intimate, we were kissing and touching, but it wasn't a sex dream, it was romantic and friendly and weird, something I have never dreamed about before. Before last night I didn't think about going into a relationship at all, I felt like I was not mature enough or stable enough for a long term relationship and I didn't really enjoy casual dating, I am pretty wrapped up in my internship. 

Overnight due to this dream an entire dynamic in my life has changed, I have never had anything like this happen to me, especially because of a dream! Now I am very interested in getting into a relationship, thinking about feels alot different than it did just 24 hours ago. Before if you asked me I would have said ""I am not really into that part of my life yet"", now I am thinking about it completely differently. Its like a switch has flipped. 

I certainly have no interest in getting into a relationship with Ella, in the same way you don't have any interest in dating your cousin, did I have this dream just because I miss my friend?

I have had relationships in the past, but those I knew for a fact we're going to end someday, high school girl friends and girls I met living abroad, short term things. I have never had interest in having a long term relationship until last night, how do I even start going about that? I am dreading being in a discord call with my friend because it will be so awkward, who else had similar experiences? Obviously I am very frazzled and would appreciate some advice and insight on this!

Have to watch in a certain way

Eyebrows on crotch actually eyes? 

You actually passed out 

Creature controlling your dream almost similar to long neck dinosaur but small enough to fit in a house and has the face of a burnt man with sharp teeth

If you do any step wrong it’s already too late

Eyebrows

The creature kisses your head all over until you mess up and then gets more and more affectionate until it rips off your head and eats it while sobbing

Some outcomes take longer until you die

Very few can actually be escaped

One is a society where shaking your head rapidly is illegal, doing this will let you break free an wake up. But this society does everything it can to stop it. Get caught and it rips off your head

Pier??

No longer living at home we moved

Back to old town but smaller house next apartments 

There’s now a pier?

At this pier inside some kind of building is when it got me

1 channel is deafeningly loud

Each outcome involves you waking up and going outside, it’s at sunset. You go through the rest of the night like nothing happened until you find a major disturbing unnatural difference in this fake world at which it kills you

It likes to say “oh sweet (name)”

5? 7 channels?

It started at my friends house, but it wasn't their house in real life, it was some sort of duplex or apartment and they lived at the top portion. Right in the beginning of the dream, I am leaving to go to my car and they walk me to the door. I walked down the stairs and towards my car. It was late at night and I had a random car I was driving. I got in and I was looking for my phone or keys or something, but I couldn't see very well. It was pitch black in the car and also outside.

I turned to look behind me for some reason, and I saw the silhouette of a figure sitting behind the passenger seat. I kind of just stared at it for a few minutes and I thought it was all just in my head. As I was about to turn back around, the silhouette spoke - ""alright alright I'll step out for now.""

I was petrified, but this guy just opens the door and steps out of my car. I immediately lock the doors and take off. I think I drove for a while before getting home. I then remember being inside of a house that was not mine in real life, but in my dream world I was home. I was also alone. I went straight to bed and after laying down for only a minute, the silhouette guy walks in and starts saying creepy things. I do not remember what exactly, but he spoke in a very deep voice. Almost whispering. 

He then proceeded to get in bed with me and before I could run he grabbed me. He held me down in the bed and I was trying to scream but no one could hear me (I couldn't even hear myself) and then he just started touching me in weird places but he didn't rape me. He just rubbed me in places like my thighs, shoulders and stomach. I remember he took off some of my clothes, and every once in a while I was able to release his grip and try and get up but then he kept pulling me back and holding my mouth shut.

I was able to escape at one point and I managed to get to a friends house and I slept in bed with her. My friend was asleep but I kept seeing the silhouette man in the shadows. 

In the dream time about an hour passed. I looked over to the door, and he walked into the room from the hallway. He crawled into bed right on top of me and I was screaming for my friend but they were dead. No matter how much the bed shook and no matter how loud I screamed she would not move. The silhouette man didn't seem threatened by my friend so I think he might have killed them in the night.

He did not hold me down for long before I was able to escape. He had taken my shirt off and I remember not caring and running away from the house and screaming for help. 

I approached a house, and as I was about to pound on the door, I already knew there was nobody home. He was behind me the whole time.

889,Vivid Dreams and Mental Health,1,dcmvv2,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/dcmvv2/vivid_dreams_and_mental_health/,2,"Heads up that this is going to be a REALLY long post. I'll also say beforehand that these dreams are pretty weird and typing the last one out for the second time makes me realize that it reads like a child's fanfiction. I'm also going to go into excruciating detail in some of this, so be ready to pay attention. TL;DR I'm having vivid nightmares and I think I'm developing schizophrenia or a similar mental illness due to the detail of my dreams.

I don't use reddit a whole lot but I think I might be able to get some information about what I've been experiencing here over Google, since this is a directly related page for it. Either way I think it'll be interesting to hear discussion.

I have been having strange, vivid dreams during naps before work and after school that have never failed to entertain me when I wake up, but lately I've questioned if this is an issue with my mental health. I've been living with depression for around a year or so, and am extremely pessimistic and isolated whenever I feel the need to be. I'm no shut-in, but lately I've had an urge to be alone/enjoy being alone for long periods of time and tend to get upset when I make plans with friends one on one and more come, although not upset at my friends and rather just an uncomfortable feeling in my gut. I'm also a very paranoid person; walking alone in my relatively small suburban house at night scares the living shit out of me. Typing this right now with my back to my door is also mildly concerning, but luckily I've found that noise (usually music) manages to keep me calm. I guess it'd be more correct to say I'm afraid of silence and the dark?

I've had a trend lately of coming home from school exhausted because of my inability to get myself in bed. I'm typing this at 1 AM on a school night instead of sleeping right now. My work hours are usually between 16-25 a week, with varying shifts every week. This week in particular I worked 17, a 5 hour shift Sunday and 4 hour shifts Monday-Wednesday. I'll come home, grab some food, put on YouTube, and then after a little bit I'll put on some Adult Swim bumps or Pink Floyd to put myself to sleep so I can catch up on missed sleep from the night before. Then I'd sink into a moderate to deep sleep with a dream I could remember the entirety of.

At first these dreams were actually nightmares, but my nightmares don't revolve around my natural fears, rather of unknown people. I tend to watch horror media a lot so cryptids or urban legends don't scare me much. However, the fact I even had nightmares or dreams at all was staggering because up until about 2 weeks ago I haven't had a dream I remembered since I was 12, and I'm 18 now.

This is especially weird to me since it's only happening in bursts and with *vivid* detail. I can recall almost every small detail from these nightmares or dreams.

The first two nightmares I had were pretty straight to the point but with an odd similarity.

[First part of the first nightmare](https://i.redd.it/512km9a4i9q31.png)

[Second part of the first nightmare](https://i.redd.it/gn91i8e5i9q31.png)

[Second and much more concerning nightmare](https://i.redd.it/glysyov8i9q31.png)

Both of these dreams took place in places I grew up in and reminisce about daily. I want to go back to both of these and I actually have an open invite to go back to my elementary school to talk to the teacher mentioned in the post. I don't really know the significance of that but it was concerning at first.

Then today I had a normal dream. Not scary, but it was concerning in its own merit. I remember literally every single minor detail for the first \~2 hours of the dream from height of other characters to their slight mannerisms. Before I talk about this one, I'll come out the gate saying yes, I'm a furry. I hope that this fact doesn't cloud your judgement of the seriousness of this post or myself as I'd like to genuinely discuss this with people.

I'll explain the first half of my dream. It starts with me and a friend of mine getting into a car crash but luckily we only sustained minor injuries and were out within the week. This was the only part of the dream with a time skip in it. We were discharged from the hospital on the day of a new kind of convention that seemed directly up my alley; basically Comic-Con with rock/metal concerts. After the last performance by what I remember to be Rob Scallon the friend I had went with suggested we split paths and look around a little. I agreed, and off I went.

One of the booths I went to was a box poll for ""Best Performance of the Night"" or something like that. I talked to the guy running it for maybe 25 seconds and then he asked if I would run the booth for a moment while he gets a drink since, in all honesty, it was braindead work. I agreed on the account I get to take one of the shirts he was selling for the event and we had a deal. He leaves, and an hour passes. I'm bored out of my mind at 11:30 according to my watch, and at this point I assume that my friend (and the guy) have left. I finally look at the surrounding booths.

To my right there's a pink carnival tent, but with no front opening. The inside was only visible from where the booth was entered, although it seemed to have an off-room or something. And what I saw inside was a LOT of attractive women in cosplays of video game or anime characters. At first I looked away because I didn't want to be rude until one of them made eye contact with me and purposefully waved her ass at me. At that point I had just kinda sat there waving back (with my hand) and they left and went to a different tent that, from what I could see, was attractive men in cosplays as well. I could only assume what happened then. Then I heard a whistle from my left.

I looked over and all I saw was a giant yellow, red and blue building. It looked like a child's castle made out of LEGOs. It was, architecturally, a mess. However what caught me off guard the most was that there was an opening in the roof which showed a bedroom. Leaning down from the bedroom and looking at me were 5 furry women. I quickly figured out which one whistled to me since she leaned out the furthest and had her hand in the air. She had blue hair and blue fur and white fur in the middle. The easiest way to describe it is Krystal from Starfox except she had a crop top and underwear on. She waved towards me and then lifted her shirt. I don't really know what drove my conscious to push me in the direction of a very obvious trap (in a literal sense not a dude in girl's clothing) but I went into that dumbass looking building ready to get some action. Or so I thought.

I walk into this building and the walls are grey, dark, and covered in pipes and concrete. Then as I'm walking I notice that the interior is not only MUCH bigger on the inside than it is on the outside, but it's also a fucking labyrinth. The way the walls and floors were laid out reminded me of this M.C. Escher art:

https://i.redd.it/j3sy4vfxm9q31.png

As I continue up the stairs I notice that the areas are getting less compact and labyrinthine and luckily I make it to a four way intersection of concrete floor directly above the sprawling maze I just wandered through. There's railing on every side and it's in the shape of a plus. There's also a giant window behind me the size of the wall, and the sky and moon were so clear it looked like I could touch them. I walked north and found a large staircase that lead up to a red brick building. On these stairs there were furries of all shapes and sizes sitting on them doing whatever and they all looked at me confused as I passed by. I walk through the door of the strange building-within-a-building and am greeted to a GIANT lobby full of chairs, almost arranged like an auditorium. Everyone in the room falls silent except for one grey furred, black haired cat with glasses and a small stature and slim build.

This cat spoke in a very nervous and sort of shaky tone to me. He told me his name was Phil and that I was essentially in an inter-dimensional elevator. He also explained how upon entry to this building we all have HUDs like in a VR game or really any shooting game. He asked why I was there, and, in a very coy and embarrassed way, told him the details. He laughed and said ""Seduced into a place like this? That's really shitty. I asked if there was any way I could get directions to the bedroom. He then led me to a hallway filled with computers and trolls from Homestuck. (I haven't read Homestuck since 2015 and I never even finished it, so this was incredibly weird to me.)

The troll said he could locate the girl if I told her what she looked like. So I did, and he closed his eyes and a blue, digital halo appeared around his head. Five seconds later he opened his eyes and said ""Marinda; Blue and Indigo Fox, Female; Level 8."" (I remember how her name was pronounced too, it was Mare-in-duh, not Muh-rin-duh.) I asked about the Levels he had mentioned and he told me the whole inter-dimensional elevator thing again but with a few more details. We were on Level 0, or the entry point. Level 1 was a desert with a cyberpunk city in it. Level 2 was a small city with a fantastically huge junkyard. After that, he doesn't know the other ones, but Level 8 is supposedly ""Heaven,"" and ""if that fox girl waved you up to Heaven I'm sure there's something about you I'm missing."" The thing is, I don't even know what was special about me. After this I left the Level to go on my adventure to this so-called ""Heaven.""

Weird as hell, I know. But I'm seriously amazed that I can recall this much of it. If you have any input on what any of this could mean or even just some kind of input I'd love to hear it. Thank you for reading this far if you have.",1570111881.0
890,Recurring dream of killing something threatening?,3,dciz6x,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/dciz6x/recurring_dream_of_killing_something_threatening/,0,"Hello r/Dreams!

&#x200B;

I was wondering if I could discuss with you a recurring dream that I have. I am confused about what it could mean. Also, curious if anyone has similar dreams?

&#x200B;

In it, I am doing something neutral-- walking, or in my home, or driving, when I encounter something threatening. It has been a man in the back of my car, an evil-looking little boy, or snakes. They approach me, and it turns to chasing. Finally, the threatening thing gets close enough for me to reach, and I grab it, and using my own hands I kill it. 

Afterwards, I feel regret, that the threatening being didn't have to die, but I didn't know how else to defend myself. After the snake dream, my friend appeared and showed me how to catch the snakes and throw them off to the side without harming them. So it is a mix of apprehension, terror, and guilt/regret. I've had dreams like this for the past six months but they are getting more frequent, now it is once a week.

The weird thing is that there was nothing to do with Hinduism in the whole dream but I just knew it was a Hindu school (if that even exists). The school had Harry Potter like architecture and a big gazebo overseeing a valley with mountains. The floor of the gazebo was the cracked face of a giant Buddha statue, and there was a crack in between that and the earth, which a lot of students fell down (I guess they just died? lmao).

So in this school there is a bunch of teenagers, including people from one of my close friend’s school (she wasn’t there) and one of my friends who recently moved back to New Zealand. We sat in the Harry Potter-esque hall while the teacher took attendance. In this school we just did painting, running and sitting while wearing golf attire.

The only thing I remember clearly from this dream is that I went back to my old school, which is my current school in real life, and told my friends that I wanted to come back to that school. I also asked them if anyone had said anything about me while I was gone, and they all completely ignored me, but when I asked them anything else they would answer me.

I've never really used reddit and I'm wondering if anybody else has experienced this before.

A few nights ago I had a dream that started with my brother ending up in the hospital for reasons I don't remember. The rest of the dream consisted of me walking home from the hospital. A bunch of random stuff happened, for example, I met a nice English lady that gave me a gift basket. Towards the end of the dream I think I got hit by a car or something because my right hip and right wrist were hurting (I remember being chased by a car but I dont remember if it hit me or why I was in pain.) I eventually made it home and thats when I started slowly waking up. Everything from the dream faded but the pain was still there. I was laying on the side that was hurting so I thought maybe I was laying my hip on top of my phone? I brushed my hand underneath me trying to move whatever I was laying on. But nope, nothing there. By that point I was fully conscious and I rolled onto my back and the pain slowly went away.

Is pain in non-lucid dreams a common thing? Is it common to feel that pain after waking up? Is it possible the pain was just the magnified sensation of my hip touching the bed?",1570094057.0
895,Jonah Hill will end the race war!,4,dcgtp9,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/dcgtp9/jonah_hill_will_end_the_race_war/,0,"All day I've been thinking of Jonah Hill, after asking my self why several times throughout the day I finally remmeber why!

""The saviour has come! Our saviour has come!"" My friend came rushing into the room almost breaking the door down as he entered. ""Have you seen this JJ? This is crazy, the race war is finally over!""  He said whilst still stumbling through the door. I was trying to make out what he was saying but he was speaking as fast as an auctioneer. Before I could figure out what he said he shoved his phone in my face. 

There it was...Jonah Hill standing there with a two big gold chains on, some Gucci slides that seemed at least two sizes too big and a two piece new york Knicks tracksuit. In the video he was playing some classical music whilst shouting like a crazy Armageddon preacher on the street. He wasn't talking about the end of the world though, he was talking about the end of the war. ""I have now declared the race war to be over."" He repeated this 3 times and followed with, ""under my command no man or woman will hate another race of people ever again!"" To which everyone was cheering and people had begun crying. 

I looked to my friend and asked if this was serious, we both knew Jonah from back in school but he was never the type to do something like this. I mean we knew he would be something one day but I thought he'd just go into acting or something like that. 

Then suddenly I was pulled in too, his voice was repeating in my mind and I could see the error of my ways! I jumped out of my seat and shook my friend. ""The race war is fucking over man! Let's go out and celebrate!"" We both ran out the house to meet some people and talk about how Jonah hill is the greatest man alive, as we approached the corner we saw the man himself. It was Jonah! He gave us both a massive hug but when he opened his mouth to talk he sounded like a car alarm going off.

Me and two family members were trying to escape an attic of a very run down ruin of a mansion. The only way out was through the little attic door thing that's basically just a square hole on the ground/ceiling. My two family members went down first, cautiously. When it was my turn an owl suddenly propped itself between me and the exit. It had such a presence that it scared me, but yet I looked it in the eyes and went down anyways(this made me feel brave and strong). Before getting all the way down, I saw that my family members had not yet escaped. There was a deranged, crazy man blocking them from escaping. He seemed lethal, evil, and his eyes were that of a phsycopath. Now, in waking life, I have had this semi conscious fear of being a coward when shit hits the fan. I always want to be that person who takes action and protects others. The person who isn't a bystander and doesn't freeze with shock. But because I've never been in many situations that have tested me in that way, I keep this fear that when something happens, I might cower. And I hate that.
But in this dream, in that moment with this psycopath threatening my family's safety, I realized just how brave I really am. Despite how terrifying the vibe of the dream was, I launched myself at this man and attacked with all my force. He laughed in my face as I grabbed at his eyes. 
Then the dream ended.

899,Dreaming that I die young.,2,dcj008,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/dcj008/dreaming_that_i_die_young/,0,"I’ve been having different variations on a dream where I have some unknown reason that’s going to make me die soon. It’s freaking me out because it’s the third time I had this sort of dream.

The first time picked up when I apparently actually died, and I was watching the world as a ghost. I was so sad and so hurt that I was dead and alone... but for some reason, I was distraught that I’d never see my sister again. All I wanted to do was be with her one more time and apologize that I didn’t get to see her go to college. Somehow, I summoned her to where I was, and we hugged and cried because she wouldn’t remember our interaction after she returned back to life. It’s strange because we’re not very close irl.

The second time, I dreamt I was in my bed, waiting to die, and many people I knew kneeled down to me and spoke with me. I’m not sure how it ended.

The one I just had really hit me for some reason. I was living in some reality where my unknown disease was probably going to kill me within the day, so my parents threw an event for me to be with friends and relatives with my time left. I guess eventually, I passed on, and woke up to a situation in my memories long, long ago. I looked to my right, and my father was there.

We started walking around this fragment in time, when all of the sudden, we realized some of my other memories were bleeding into this one, pieces of photos, maps of where I’ve been... I think we saw it as a way to save me. Like a portal into my past, if we can change something from these memories, I can keep living.

We kept exploring the memories, a lot of which I’m not sure I’ve ever had before, and I kept feeling weaker until I just collapsed in my dad’s arms. I guess we failed.

Almost asleep but not quite, I lay trying to quiet my mind. A calm sweeps over me, and my eyes are closed but I see strange creatures.

There was an ominous feeling and one of the protectors ripped a chunk off of the different one. At first I felt the panic and betrayal of the injured creature, as though I were it. My perspective then shifted to that of the one who caused the injury, a male, and I suddenly realized this was a part of the creature’s growth, their lifecycle. He spoke telepathically of his sadness at the pain he’d caused and the other answered him, female, of how it was necessary and they would help it through the rest. It had to shed its outer skin to become like them; these protectors never betrayed what I now knew to be the younger creature but were simply helping it grow. Then they worked together to strip it of the rest of its outer shell, in a much more relaxed, slower, and healing way, revealing a terrific green dragon within.

But then after that, I found out that there was a chance he wasn't a robber and that I shouldn't have beat him up. Idk what this means. And that's all I kinda remember 🤷‍♂️",1570059425.0

915,Drew blood from a stone,5,dccfnd,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/dccfnd/drew_blood_from_a_stone/,0,"I entered through a set of double doors, walking out onto a walkway in the sky. The walkway joined together in a sort of symmetrical network of pathways, with the space between them being open pits into the sky. Everyone was wearing scrubs colored based on the group they arrived with. I walked around for a bit, exploring. Before long I started to realize I was trapped in this courtyard in the sky. 

Around this time people started to pair off in male-female couples with others from a different color of scrubs. At that time I decided to leap over the railing into the sky. Because I’ve had so many dreams of falling/flying the sensation always makes me go lucid. So I flew around the compound with resembled a sort of futuristic castle. The network of walkways reminiscent of a courtyard hosting a ball. 

I decided to fly as high as I could go. As I ascended into darkness I found myself in a room with a stone that looked more like a mass of unearthed roots. It had the same sort of shape as the walkway. I felt a female presence in the room. I noticed an exposed end of the stone where I could see what was at the core of the graphite tube. It was a deep shade of purple. It looked like a petrified medium rare steak. 

I reached out and touched it. The stone receded from my hand when I applied pressure, almost as if I had absorbed its essence. It’s blood poured out onto the floor. The female presence watched patiently. 

And then, suddenly there was another. She quickly began to swirl the blood on the floor, painting it into a shape that got up and came to life. She began to consume the stone, forcing creation from its blood. 

I panicked, begging her to stop. She continued frenziedly. It was then that I and the other female presence began to consume the stone also, shaping creation and battling through the network hoping to cut the woman off from her end of consumption. Then there were more people. And more. We couldn’t stop them. I stepped away from the stone and took a long look at it. A deep breath. Then I woke up.",1570061772.0

It was repeatedly stinging my scalp, every time I tried to pick it up with my fingers it stung even more aggressively. Then the dream changed to me sitting in a car stuck in traffic. I was in the passenger side and nobody was in the drivers seat which was strange. All of a sudden the car started rolling very fast into the road and I couldn’t stop it, I was panicking and trying to lift the emergency break but nothing could stop the car. It quickly hit somebody else’s car and scratched all the left side, I was freaking out and worried about the driver attacking me/cussing me out/calling the police but the guy I crashed into was actually nice and not angry. Then it switched to me in his car and he was driving me to where I needed to go, I was surprised by how kind he was to me and my dream self even felt ‘love’ for this kind stranger. Then the dream went on to me buying knitting supplies (I don’t knit) and other random unremarkable dream-like situations.

I felt bad so her and I had some talks. She looked like a mixture of Tomie from Junji Ito and Tomoko Kuroki from Watamote. 

One day the gang said her time was coming, and all I remember is cuddling up with her and holding her close.

She whispered, “I don’t want to leave you.”

I hugged her closer and said, “I won’t let you.”

I was a part of a group that consisted of my friends that went into a game show. We did well enough to get second place but we didnt win. Afterward, we arrived back home and went our separate ways. I came home to my mom, dad, sister, and grandmother. We sat and talked about the show for a while but then my dad decided me, my mom, my sister and himself, should go say hi to my other grandmother on his side of the family. We pack up the car and head off. 

We arrive and after talking for a bit there was a weird issue with an electronics box (I could not make it out it was small and rectangular like a DVD player or cable box but idk). All of a sudden I just see white and I wake up in a hospital bed in an all white room and I look around and I see there is only a red tube connecting me into a machine in the room. I start to freak out a bit but then I notice there is two other people next to me. A young boy that looked like he was about 12/13 with really dark red hair and a girl with black that looked as if she was about my age (22) but could be a little younger. I try to call out to them but they couldnt hear me and after struggling to get their attention for a bit I fell out of the bed which caused the red tube to fall out of me as well.

As soon as the tube fell out everything went black and I looked above me and I saw a light leaving from me and i proceeded to fall down back into the white bed again. But this time there were people around talking. The boy and the girl were next to me awake talking. They notice me come to and began to ask me things. They ask me like what caused me to he here, what happened to my tube, and other questions to try to figure me out. I saw their tubes were gone and asked them what happened to theirs and they explained that they had similar events happen as well. The boy was walking past a building when something happened and he woke up here and the girl heard yelling outside of her class when she woke up in the hospital. After hearing their stories, I understood that we were in the afterlife. 

The I freaked out for a while and began to cry, but then I started to run around the hospital to try and find my family but no one was there. I returned back to the room to see them watching something on the TV and I sat next to them in my bed watching it with them.  

After that everything, about the dream was super fuzzy and I cant remember anything else, the main thing I can kinda remember is it kinda turned into a funny dream afterward. This was really the strangest dream I've had in a while. Really ive only had depressing or dark/scary dreams recently, so even though this was grim in a way I kind of enjoyed it. What was weirder was that it felt like everything was real, like I felt everything that happened in the dream like the light (which i assume was my soul) leaving me. Idk how else I can put it. 

Can anyone try to help me figure this out? I know it seems like it's just random but idk why its stuck with me. I've been up for hours now and it won't go away. If anyone could try to interpret it, be free to let me know.",1570039266.0

&#x200B;

I was talking with some random strangers at a circular table and we were having some kind of  unintelligible dream conversation - you know, kind of like the one you're participating in but you're not really sure what you or they are saying (but you don't seem to notice because it's apart of the dream) and suddenly the person on my right got -  possessed for lack of a better word - and suddenly looked straight at me.

It snapped me sober, for lack of a better word and I looked right back at it. I wish I could remember what it looked like - shortish from what I can recall and maybe not entirely human - but not scary. Like it felt like it was making eye contact right at me, and not the dream me -  like it was breaking the fourth wall of the dream. Any of you remember Assassin Creed 2's ending? Something like that final conversation of that complete shock of a fourth wall break.

It said something along the lines of ""Remember this: 9 1 1"" in a weird - but not creepy - voice. I think the numbers ""1 1 1 1, or 1 1 1 4"" or something like that were included after the ""9 1 1"" as well. But the 911 came first, as if it was its own message, then the other numbers came. The second batch of numbers are a little fuzzier so I could be wrong on those but I DISTINCTLY  remember the 911. The 911 part though wasn't scary to me, it didn't feel to me like a warning, urgent, or deadly serious - it was just in a neutral tone. I wasn't scared at all, in fact.

So, sorry, dream-thing, I guess I couldn't remember all of the message you were trying to tell me.

I very rarely have lucid dreams and lately my dreams have been hazy, but I  remember this vividly as if it was a memory in real life. Then  literally everything went black and it told me all cryptic-like ""You'll know what it means""  or ""You figure it out"". I forget the exact vernacular, but that was the general gist of it, and again it didn't feel like some kind of an ominous warning. And then immediately I woke up incredibly confused.

Anyone have an idea what in the in actual world was that? I usually don't have crazy dreams like that, especially ones where I felt like the people I'm talking to are  actually trying to talk to me in the real world. Are there any dream gurus or people of the sort out there that have ANY idea or even get a shot at what it means? Dream morse code? An algorithm? ...lotto numbers? Why even speak in just numbers to begin with and not words?",1570017500.0

I kept clinging to the floor so I wouldn’t fall as if I was super high up in the clouds, but in actuality I never actually left the train platform it was inside this train station. I never saw the outside of it. The entire time I was asleep I had realized I was sleeping so knew this was just a dream. I realized because of how the train stationed felt like I was above the clouds about to fall even though I was underground. I live in New York so it looked similar to the modern train subway station on grand central 42nd, but it was much more older like a modern take on a old fashioned look. Then eventually everything went to all white. Then I saw the imagery appear almost like paint of an old building that was morphing. While it did I was starting to focus at the top of the roof, then the paint like construct started look more like the roof. Then like paint everything became white once more like a purgatory state (only inside I felt like it wasn’t purgatory). This Deer/Elk looking thing with antlers appeared. My immediate thought was the devil. Then the Deer/Elk looking thing grew bigger and it tried attacking me. It was silent the entire time but I felt inside that it was after me, planning on capturing my soul and fusing it with it. Even though I knew it was a dream I could not wake up. I felt in real life that I was sitting in chair dozing off asleep and my body immediately became number as I tried to consciously wake myself up. I knew where I was in real time/real life but I couldn’t force myself to wake up and the monster kept getting bigger and bigger and closer to me. I began to see myself in real time. It doesn’t make sense what I’m going to describe but it felt as if I was still seeing what was in front of me in first person while seeing myself 3rd person even though I couldn’t actually see myself. Then I started yelling, “Go Away!” At the top of my lungs. As I yelled the Deer/Elk monster thing got smaller in size and I started to grow bigger. I breathed in again and this time I yelled “Ahhh!” Then after the craziest dream ever I woke up and thought to myself that was the most insane dream I ever had. Only 3 minutes had passed by. The most interesting thing to me was that the Deer/Elk thing never actually made a sound, as I was yelling I was the one that had the deep demonic voice. Any ideas as to what this could represent? I work as an overnight security guard, I fell asleep at 3:50 am and woke up at 3:54 am. I had no food, I drank a red bull to stay up, I was not watching any scary films or stories, and I have had a scary dream before where I get my body taken over by a dark figure. I never had a dream with a deer elk but I have had dreams where a dark liquids or dark clouds of ash/dust like substance forces its way into my body but never at work this is the first time and it was way off. I am not religious or spiritual. This is the first time I ever encountered a paint like substance that could morph and change the way everything looks.

929,Bizarre dream,2,dc9dxm,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/dc9dxm/bizarre_dream/,0,"If I've ever dreamt about celebrities, I don't remember, but I like to think that I'm mostly confident that I don't really tend to dream of celebrities at all. I've never been the kind of person to have a crush on famous people. And there's not many in particular that I look up to because I figure whatever I like about them are traits I have imposed on my own image of them.

So, knowing that, I dreamt about Rob Lowe last night.

It's not like he's one of the superstars right now, not like a Marvel superhero or Keanu Reeves or something. The only shows I remember him from were Parks and Rec, which I watched about a year ago, and The West Wing.

Anyway, in my dream, it appeared to be a world where there were several copies or clones of Rob Lowe. I remember going to an event at a park that I don't think I've ever been to, and spotting him on his way to the stage. The people there were all roughly my demographic; aka, the exact audience you might expect to enjoy Parks and Rec. I have seen them all before, I go to school with some probably, or have in the past. They were all very excited to see him.

Rob Lowe walks right past me, and I start to greet him with something familiar, like I had met him before. The way I would greet a friend. He stops to look at me, and I recognize that he's never seen me before. I didn't automatically assume that he just didn't remember, like I might for an actual encounter with a celebrity, but instead I knew that I had the wrong Rob Lowe. 

There were several copies of him that existed all over the world. I don't know how I knew this, because it was never expressed in the dream. But I knew that this Rob Lowe was not the Rob Lowe who I and several of my peers had met before in the past. There were quite a few just in my state. This was something he was famous for, apparently. He was doing something like a tour, except it wasn't so much of a tour since the clones never had to travel very far, and he had to be doing stand up or something similar.

Anyway, overall very strange dream. I remember being totally bummed out that the Rob Lowe that had come was not the Rob Lowe I had met before. My friends were as well. 

I think the strangest thing about the dream was that I didn't remember his name. I knew him, I knew where he had acted and stuff, but in the dream and in real life, I just had completely forgotten what his name was. I had to look it up before I began typing this.

As usual, within a dream, you never really question what's happening and why. Only now am I beginning to wonder what the hell was going on. Where did all of those Rob Lowes come from? Did they all share some sort of mental connection, like a hive mind? Why were there so many of them? Which one starred in Parks and Rec within my dreamworld? Are some Rob Lowes more famous than others, and do they have ways of distinguishing themselves from one another? If the premise wasn't so bizarre, I might want to write some sort of science fiction short story just to try and answer all of those questions.",1570047454.0

In the dreams where I have a baby, I’m so happy being a mom and taking care of my baby, but I’m also alone in these dreams. There’s never anyone else there and it doesn’t seem like there ever was.

Anyone else experience this or know what it could mean?",1570056888.0

936,Help interpreting please..?,1,dcauja,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/dcauja/help_interpreting_please/,0,"I have been dreaming about my ex for 10 years now. I admittedly did not get over him for about 8 in my waking life, with hope of somehow getting back with him. But feel like after a lot of inner work and healing I finally let him go. The dreams stopped for a short time. For a while I was literally having them at least about twice a week. Super emotional and felt so real and would wake up in emotional knots feeling like I was going to just fall apart in sadness over how painful it was. I have been with a new man for 5 years, married for 2. In these dreams, so many times I find my ex. He tells me he forgives me (the break up was my fault over cheating... I loved my ex more than anyone ever but I was very damaged and had a cheating problem from my past) anyway, he forgives me and then we cuddle and kiss and he accepts me back. It often involves me saying, I need to divorce my husband and be with you. I love you so much etc. WHY do I keep having these dreams?? They are so torturous. I love my husband very much. We have conflict, where with my ex not much, but this current relationship I have grown SO much through the conflict and feel it is a spiritual partnership of growth..I dont want to leave him but when I am honest, heart still misses ex. I believe dreams are a reflection of self... I have tried to look at it like he is my anima, but why is it HIM every single time. And even then I still cant interpret it. So hard to look at neutrally when the emotions are so intense. I suppose my subconscious knows what its doing but I am not getting the message obviously.   If anyone is intrigued and would like to help me read into this, i would be so grateful and happy to give more details of life or dream details.",1570054810.0
937,Psychological Dream about my family/other?,1,dcati4,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/dcati4/psychological_dream_about_my_familyother/,0,"So in my dream I woke up one morning and I had somebody else's face transplanted into the side of my head (nose, eyeballs, and mouth). I'm looking in the mirror and the face is contorting in weird ways, but it doesn't appear to be capable of thinking or speaking it's just the vestigial features of a face. Immediately concerned and freaked out by the fact that there's a foreign face growing on the side of my head, I go downstairs and ask my parents about it. My parents have no look of worry or anything, they act like this is completely normal and that there's nothing to be worried about. 

A few minutes later I somehow magically know that my dad sedated me while I was asleep and I underwent surgery to have this face put into my head (I saw this in 3rd person), dream logic I guess. I confront my mom about it and she says ""Oh your dad loves helping people, think about it honey you're giving someone else a new chance at life.""

This face has no brain and it's not capable of thinking or speaking, just weird facial expressions. How is that a new chance at life exactly, is what I'm thinking. 

So life goes on as normal (except for the fact that in the dream I never go to school or out in public). A few days later I wake up with 2 more faces on the other side of my head. One is a full sized face exactly like the other and then there is also like a half face with it. I guess there's not much in the way of my thinking at this point, but I just feel so helpless that I can't do anything about these faces that are appearing. They all have the same behavior as the first face. 

So life goes on again and then where my head was shaved for these face transplants the hair starts growing back and the faces gradually start to disappear. Then the dream ends. 

So I question the reason I might have a dream like this and I can think of a one. I'm not feeling like I have enough control in my life and I'm still living with my parents, etc...(I'm 18 years old)

I just find it really disturbing that I had to helplessly watch as the faces were being put in and then having to live with them, and not being able to do anything about it. So overall the creepiness factor was through the roof. From what my mom said in the dream I can only think that the faces belonged to the survivors of accidents, otherwise the thing about it being a new life for them wouldn't make any sense. Then I also remember harboring some sort of feeling of guilt that I couldn't live with the faces because they've had a tougher life than I have. Also, if my dad cared so much for the faces why did they have to be transplanted onto my head? Why not his head or any other member of my family? 

Anyways, this dream might be absolute bs or it could be stress related, I'm not quite sure. It felt like something straight out of sci-fi and my out of body experiences from when I was sleeping within the dream didn't help. Anybody else had a dream similar to this?",1570054676.0
938,A maze?,5,dc5uc5,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/dc5uc5/a_maze/,0,"I had 2 dreams about lives that I never lived, like an alternate universe of my current life. One thing that stuck out the most was the architecture of the alleyway .It was during what seemed to be in the afternoon with pink skies. The alley was clean, the buildings were clean, everything looked amazing. Windows and doorways on both sides. I could tell I was in a high end area but I couldn’t really pinpoint where exactly how far I was from a particular location, it just seemed like I was in a really nice walkway between two apartment buildings at all times. At the time I was visiting a friend that lived in Europe that I knew for a while and we used to hook up occasionally. I had memories  of this universe like I’ve been here my whole life.

In this dream I find out I have a child that I didn’t know about. I’ve always wanted a child.
 
I woke up and remembered every detail. The scent of her house, the tall white buildings, the stiffness of her belly while she was pregnant, her voice was clear and loud like she was standing right next to me.I remembered shared memories with her when we first met. I felt so complete. When I woke up, I was overwhelmed with sadness, wishing that it was all real. I felt anger and confusion to how my mind convinced me that everything was real.

Now in real time a few years has past since I’ve had that dream but I always think about it.

Recently I had another dream where I was eating with my sister. 

I walk out of my house and there I am, in that same clean beautiful alleyway.  My sister told me to meet her at  this Indian restaurant. On my way there it seemed like I was walking through a network of walkways and intersections but for some reason I knew exactly where to go. I get to the restaurant and paid for my sisters meal. The employees shouting my name the whole time like I go there often.After we’re done eating I walk outside and instantly get an over view picture of where I was at like I’m looking down on a maze. In this maze I could see where my special friend lived like I was in the same dream but different location. Like I was right down the road from her house but she didn’t exist in this dream. I was literally in my dream recalling another dream which caused me to wake up

I could never recall my dreams but those dreams I remember like it happened just a few moments ago. I can remember every detail about them but what’s really strange was the whole maze. Why a maze? What does it mean?",1570022425.0
939,slack jawed humanoid thing stalked me in a dream and I woke up feeling ill,1,dcajaz,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/dcajaz/slack_jawed_humanoid_thing_stalked_me_in_a_dream/,0,"I had a nightmare that was oddly like...not horrifying.  Just immensely quietly scary if that makes any sense at all. Like a noiseless panicked dread. In the dream, I was doing what I normally do in the mornings, waiting for my brother so I could take him to school. But when I went to my own room, the windows were open, and by that I mean the blinds were all gone. I saw a white truck parked outside, it seemed the guy inside was watching and I felt a really chill fear come over me. I say ""him"" very loosely,  it was more of an It. Its cliché but I guess clichés still can freak me out.  It had awful white flesh, like inhumanly white. Its mouth was large, it's long,large crooked teeth jutting out and making the large mouth look malformed.  It looked slack jawed, but not like a broken jaw. Its mouth just didnt seem like it could close. Its eyes looked pale and unfocused, like really light blue fish eyes.  It had no ears, and no hair on its head and said head was shaped like a slightly pointy egg. Smaller up top and wider on bottom, again because of those awfully big jagged teeth in it's wide mouth. Sorry to over explain the guy-thing. I know it details my nightmare explanation, but He was the reason it was a nightmare.   Anyway that thing was parked outside my windows,  I quietly dropped to the floor checking to see if he was looking at me. It didnt seem like it. I shuffled backwards slowly on my belly.  Back until I could get away, I got into my parents lifted truck and laid on the floor of it. Peeking, seeing the white truck drive slowly away from the window and around, to where my car and my parents truck was. The thing got out of its truck, and went to my car. Seeing I wasnt in it, the guy thing searched the car a little.  From the window of where I was hiding I saw my brother in the distance.  I wanted to shout to him but that would alert the guy thing, and I wanted so desperately as I heard the thing get closer and the truck door opening to run away, fast towards my little brother but i think i was afraid it would get him too. So i lay motionless on my belly as i feel the truck's door open and its hand grips my ankle as I'm dragged out. It seemed so slow and painless.  I remember hearing words that weren't my voice in my head. I cant remember exactly and I'm frustrated but I remember they were horrifying to me, but instilled a sense of peace and acceptance that it would be over soon. It felt dull, numb, it felt like I was compressed or crunched up into a small box until I just wasn't anymore. Everything was black. 
That's it. I woke up feeling weak, my stomach feels bad and I'm hot. Yes, this illness was probably the cause of the nightmare in the first place, but I just felt so shitty after this nightmare.  Also I think it's weird that the guy things  face looked only vaguely humanoid but it wore a longsleeve blue shirt. Maybe denim idk. Anyway...just wanted to put this out there, I usually type out my nightmares if I can remember them.",1570053359.0

Ran outside to a bunch of people yelling. On a television, there was a report that a missile had been launched from India. Then the power went out. One of the clearest things I remember was panic. I was certain my town was gonna get hit, that I was doomed. Some time later, power comes back on, TV reports that ""only"" 15 missiles had been fired, a couple locations on the east coast of the US, a few in India, a few in the middle east/africa. NYC got hit. There was video footage of what they were calling the ""sea of glass""; an enourmous melted stretch of windows that had been fused into a plain with tall jagged spikes in it. Also remember footage being played of liquified human remains flowing through the streets like a stream. There was a weird feeling of differentness, like the whole world was a castle of cards that had just collapsed, and I was living in the aftermath. Then I woke up",1570025133.0

Every other time I cannot move for what feels like around 5 seconds and can move an arm or leg to wake up properly.

Tonight I woke up half paralysed lying sideways and heard an extremely scary version of my own voice laughing softly and moving quickly to each corner of the ceiling. I then heard my family through the window opening the front door and walking straight past my door (not real) and soon my mum walked to the door. Instead of opening it to help me she did that same laugh outside my room and left.

The whole time I could slightly move my back (curled lying sideways) and even open my mouth and get some quiet noise out but it was extremely difficult. Im not sure if I was awake the whole because part of it I imagined myself crawling to the door and knocking (when mum came to door) but I somehow was back in bed straight after. 

I managed to wake up by putting all my strength into shaking my head side to side, but am now in bed shivering and scared to go back to sleep. Just wondering if this type of thing is normal for people who get sleep paralysis or if i should be concerned about my mental health. Also any tips on what to do in these situations would be helpful.

In real life, the my tarot cards are (Using an online birth calculator) my tarot cards are ""The world"" and ""The empress"".

The dream's tarot card seemed to be represented by unknown star constelation that I have no idea what constelation is.

What does the dream is trying to tell me? What does it interpret?

Everyone around me was just looking at it in silence, then it rose right above me and all the planet's aligned with the sun in the middle and made a cross.

946,Weird Dreams,2,dc7ca8,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/dc7ca8/weird_dreams/,2,"So, I've been having really weird dreams for the last few months. Before this, I'd remember my dreams for about 10 minutes before forgetting them completely, but now, I'm able to remember small details for weeks. I think a large part of this is due to what actually happens in my dreams. Let me explain

1) A lot of the dreams I have are borderline nightmares. Not in the way that I feel threatened or scared, but I still wake up Inna cold sweat gasping for air. 

2) The details tend to stick with me for a while  for example, I remember being at my grandmother's house in one of the dreams and I remember the exact conversation we had in the dream.

3) In every dream, I see the same person. It's difficult to describe him, but in my dream he always seems familiar. He doesn't look like anyone famous or like any of me relatives, so I'm unsure what to think.

I've talked to a few friends and a counselor about my experiences, and most of them brought up that school stress can cause stuff like this (since it's my first semester of college) but when they describe what people normally experience, it isn't like what I've experienced.

I don't really know if anyone has an answer to this, but I'd really like to get some further insight on why this is happening. Thanks",1570033471.0

 “I think my brain was trying to make me upset? There were 2 short segments in my dream that were upsetting. We had a lizard in it’s enclosure and apparently it was dying, and I was watching it’s soul leave it’s body. But you read online that if the lizard moves an object in its enclosure he’s gonna be okay. The lizard wasn’t doing anything and it was closing it’s eyes. Until it finally moved something with its mouth and we were relieved. Then the second segment was me being a superhero character. I was going through a house at night going to fight some bad guys or something or maybe I was the bad guy? And explosion or two went off and I hid under the kitchen counter and I look at my hands. There was little blood drops on them. And all of a sudden “CUUUUUT!” The lights brighten and all along I was actually playing a character on a SUPERHERO TV SHOW. The other actors came up to me and asked if I was okay. They also said that we gotta keep going and if the creator of the show was here he would’ve cancelled filming for the day. And all I could say was ‘I’m sorry.’ I was sobbing so much I couldn’t breathe or get words out properly. And then you woke me up.” 

I’m currently reflecting and I’m wondering what could this mean? Haha I don’t usually have dreams that make me react in real like like that (meaning that I’ve had a few in the passed that I can recall) and maybe it could mean something deep(er)?",1569969415.0

So this dreams starts out with me and my family going to a museum, so we get in the truck and we start driving there but then we for some reason make these people made at this stop light or something (it's so blurry with this point that I don't remember what happened exactly since there are two ways I can tell it so I'll hold off)

So then we get to the museum and I'm going up the stairs when I think my family was going downstairs,

Then the same two people came in (I think) and they wanted to find us but they couldn't for some reason that I forgot and so they left.

Now I think if I remember this is a different dream but i forgot so I tell it here,

So in this dream I was wondering around this place trying to get somewhere safe and I think I was in a warehouse or underground (I think it was the warehouse) and the place was flooded with water and while I was swimming to this cab of a truck I didn't look back cause I felt as if I looked back I would see something following me in the water that I didn't want to see so I never looked behind me,

So then I reach the cab and I see water in it and so I didn't get in cause of what might be in the water so then I find this lever and reach as best I can and pull the lever and the water starts to drain and the cab was drained and wasn't that deep, but the main area I was in was deep (like maybe around 50-100 feet if I had to guess)
And I was dangling and then woke up

10

So in this dream I'm in the nice looking hallway and I then go into one of the doors which then brings me to this one point in the dream where it's like the game baldy but I don't quite know it yet and I'm still exploring to see what would be the best place to run out and escape and then I go into this dark room that seems big,

 so I'd want to do it first if anything so I don't get caught, so I go to the lit area and it's like a maze that I have to move through and I see this one book that I have to get as I would then have to run all over the place getting others,

Then I count to 3 and then grab the note book and run to this one area in this hallway hoping to have a better way

But I saw that it was blocked off as I then turn around and fry to go back but someone like baldy comes to me but I try to go to the left and hug the wall so he couldn't get me but he got me and I then woke up.",1570020201.0

The first two were dumb and I don't remember what they were. What I do remember, though, is that before he deployed each one, he would announce it and it's chemical composition, and all of them contained potassium. Including, for some reason, the third and final one, which was a nuclear bomb. Now with the first two devices, we just drove away from it and it didn't do anything to us, but with this one, the person who had driven us said something along the lines of ""we're not getting away from this one."" So we stood in there, just waiting to be incinerated, and soon, there was about 5 seconds of acid rain, followed by bright light starting to come in through the window and the air starting to get warmer. Over the next few seconds, my vision grew white and it got hotter and hotter, but never actually hurt. I rationalized the lack of pain by concluding that my nervous system must have been vaporized before it could register pain.

After a while, we ended up in an outdoor water center of the resort, with splash pads and a couple of small slides. One teenage kid, separate from the three I was babysitting, was getting roudy and physical with others, so I get the bright idea to restrain him by myself to get him to calm down.

The whirlpool un raveled itself around me revealing a place i knew well. It was a summer’s morning, everything was new and fresh.

the sun shone down, a meadow of soft grass and pretty flowers streched before me to the jagged coast line, 
in the distance the blue sea shimmered.

And she was there, resting on her knees in front of me, her white cotten dress flowing over her knees, just sitting there smilling at me, fitting right in.

we both got up, slowly we walked the few steps to each other and embraced
like two souls intertwined.

As I drew her tighter to me, she dissolved away into nothing, and everthing around me faded to black. I woke up.",1569978212.0

The day would start over from the beginning. The same things would happen, with the same problems occurring, and I was the only one who noticed we were in some sort of loop.

Recently moved to a new city for a new job. During the process i stopped talking to my narcissistic mother. I decided to cut contact from her. Until i decided if i wanted to talk to her again. It's been months since i talked to my mom. We had an argument that made me realize how narcissistic she really was, and theres more, but thats another story.

2 reason why i mentioned my mother,

1. spiders often symbolize overbearing female energy commonly mothers.
2. I saw my mother in the dream.

Dream: I just remembered being in bed, at my moms house i remember being on this bed that had a dead spider on it, spider was quite huge too, in fact it was actually a dead orange **Sun Spider.** Along with this, i also seen a dead long brown worm. I remember my mom coming in, and not hesitating to remove the sheets that contained the dead insects, and went ahead to put a fresh white bed sheet on my bed.

This dream was somewhat hard to understand, all that stuck to me was this dead spider and how loving my mother was in this scenario. Could this be an alternate reality or a devastating premonition ?",1570007415.0

I'm in an urban/very nice suburban area.  There is a very true to life (a VERY large, very very realistic) lost baby hippo running around that ended up here somehow.  There isn’t a good environment here for it at all here in Concrete Retail Cityish Suburbia and it has a good chance of dying a very uncomfortable death.  So I try to use a cell phone and call some local agencies like the police to try and relocate this poor little hippo to a better location.  This is entirely fruitless as this has “happened before” but the local places and organizations won’t help very large lost animals.


So SUDDENLY I’m inside maybe a coffee cafe like place and two acquaintances of mine, who in real life do not know each other at all, are there.  I was ""in their clique"" and we were a trio but now the two of them are now Best Friends Forever, and without even telling me anything they have decided to “work together” for this hippo.  I am clearly not welcome anymore, I’ve been “third-wheel-zoned”.  

I comment to someone else off camera that both of their families have A LOT of money and influence, and that’s how they get along so well and I don’t have any money or anything, so that’s the main unspoken reason why I am excluded.  


I thought I had a mug and a pack of matches (nestled in the mug) with the proper contact info on them or something ""from before"" to even vaguely help me but on second look the info on the mug and matches is useless.
                   

So then suddenly it turns into a large crowd venue, like an auditorium/concert hall or a stadium.  I’ve been weirdly shot out at the audience, like I was used as a human cannonball, and I roll over so many peoples’ heads and this will make them angry at me.  I feel extremely annoyed and awkward from all this and I want to get out of this stadium ASAP.


The thing that was taking place in the concert hall/stadium is now over and people are ready to leave and I am HURRYING to get out of here as I feel super annoyed from this whole ""day"".

976,Acceptance of death,15,dbq5kv,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/dbq5kv/acceptance_of_death/,3,"Last night or early yesterday morning I had a dream about my death and more importantly accepting my death. 

I was working at a new job building bridges between space and time and different dimensions entirely. I am a large guy and apparently they had never told me that there was a weight limit on these bridges. I stepped onto a platform and it started to sink into the space between dimensions. I grabbed onto the railings to try and pull myself back up, but the railing just sank with me as well. My boss just looked back at me with a sad look and said to the rest of the trainees that there was nothing they could do. 

I started to fall and spin into the void of nothingness. I was crying at first realizing I'd never see my family or my friends again. I'd never be able to start my own family. I'd never get to travel the world or see what I could make of myself beyond my short 20 years on earth. The more I thought about life the more I started to regret.

The G forces of infinitely falling and spinning faster and faster started to make me get woozy and start to fade in and out of consciousness. Finally with my last breath I could muster and one more minute of being able to clearly think, I looked back and realized, even though I'd never be able to say goodbye, I accepted that this was my time to go. The void was going to consume me and my matter and energy would be repurposed somewhere somehow. And I shed two final tears.

These two tears felt like condensed liquid heroin rolling down my cheaks. I felt such euphoria and joy in my final seconds. My family would move and and be happy again. My friends would find a new friend to take my place. And the girl who may or may not have been waiting for me would find love in someone else. I lived a full life for all intensive purposes and that was good enough for me. I closed my eyes one last time and let out that last breath. 

Then in the blink of an eye I woke up with two tears running down my face and smile still on my lips.  I don't fear death. I know it will come for me when it's my time. I know what earth has given me, will take back again. 

Life is to short to be afraid of taking your last breath.

I don't know if this is relevant but let this be prefaced with the fact that I had sleep paralysis twice while falling asleep the night before, and then dreamed someone was dragging me out of bed (woke up screaming).

&#x200B;

Last night, I dreamt i was a child again, in my old neighborhood, but I had all the knowledge I have today. It started with me getting everyones mail, I think my father was a landlord in this dream. I could only open 2 mailboxes, and the rest of the keys were for locks on women's necks (I recognized one of them as my aunt). The lockers were crusted over with blood and dried/dead skin, which makes me think they might've been dead. 

After that I went into my old basement and a woman who looked like she was addicted to heroin or something followed me in and asked if she could take some things. I said yes, when my father came in and asked what I was doing I replied ""I'm in the basement with a junkie."" He went up to her and looked into her eyes and said, ""She's not a junkie, she's a good woman having a bad time."" I started bawling immediately (my family has a history of drug problems). 

Afterwards, I was in my living room having a conversation with an older man I didn't recognize. We were talking about smartphones, and this dream was taking place in the past so I was mindful not to make it clear that I wasn't from there. After a while, I just started singing ""paradox paradox paradox paradox"", when my mother walked in and put an iPhone and the logitech headset I have at home with my [Battle.net](https://Battle.net) Tag on the box. I immediately followed her into the kitchen. I asked her if she knew I was from the future, and she didn't look at me. I told her I just wanted to see my father. She said ""You didn't have to do that."" I started bawling again and told her ""I just want to go home."" over and over again. I curled up in a ball on the floor crying and closed my eyes, and I felt her pushing me back to reality. I was in an empty plane with, strangely enough, runescape monsters and geometry. As I got closer to waking up, I felt a physical sensation like a vacuum sucking my mind back into my physical body, and I woke up screaming next to my girlfriend.

982,Dreaming about a Recently Deceased Friend,2,dbwaox,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/dbwaox/dreaming_about_a_recently_deceased_friend/,1,"Hi everyone! This is my first time posting on here, but I've always been really interested in dreams.

About a month ago someone that I was more acquainted with than a friend died unexpectedly and so young. We talked in passing a few times last semester and I always thought he was interesting, but never saw him again on campus (I go a university with 30,00+ students). I heard that someone had died the first week of classes, however I didn't find out it was him for three more weeks. Although he was not a close friend, his death has made me reflect on life in general a lot more and usual realization stuff like that. Other than grandparents, his death has been only one to ever hit close to home.

Now for the dream. I was in a room alone with the only light being dim sunlight coming through window shears. There was a table in the middle of the room and very clearly had a body under a white sheet on the top. I somehow knew that it was him, but did not feel scared. I remember feeling like I was in the room for hours upon hours and there was no noise at all. Eventually I went over to the table and lifted the sheet back and saw the look of death on his face, but again did not feel scared. It kind of felt like a David Lynch scene lol. Anyway, I sat in a chair in the corner of the room and just stared at the table. A few other people came in the room eventually (I have no clue who they were) and we all stared intently at his sheet covered body. I remember seeing the sheet moving up and down suddenly and then someone going over and removing the cover. I walked over and realized that he was breathing and alive. I had a notion that everyone's love and energy brought him back. He opened his eyes and without saying a word, left the room and acted as if everything was normal. The rest of the dream was me interacting with my neighbors and friends trying to find out where he had gone, as I had not seen him again after he left the room. I wish I could remember more.

I am used to extremely vivid dreams, however this one just really freaked me out after I woke up. Perhaps I'm just having a difficult time coping with his death, but I've never dreamt about him before. Does anyone have thoughts on interpretation?

Thanks for reading!",1569977929.0

984,I gave myself closure in a dream over something that has been upsetting me for 5 years,4,dbt3o5,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/dbt3o5/i_gave_myself_closure_in_a_dream_over_something/,1,"Okay so when I was a little younger, around 17 or so I met this guy and he was essentially my first love. He was a POS though and strung me along for years. He did some pretty messed up shit that should’ve been huge red flags but of course I was totally head over heels for him. I eventually stopped talking to him for good two years ago when I met my bf.

But every now and again I’ll have a dream about him and for a few days all my old feelings about the situation get washed up to the surface. Like it will have me totally distraught the day after I have one. I know that sounds dramatic but that’s how deeply the whole situation affected me. 

I had one of these dreams about him a couple of months ago and this happened. In the dream I was just kind of throwing myself at him and he was blatantly ignoring and rejecting me. Which was a pretty obvious reflection of how I felt rejected by him. This upset me for about a week and then I got over it. 

Then the other night I had another dream about him. He invited me over to his house where he lives with his current gf. He wanted to talk as friends. When I got there we talked. And even though there was some sexual tension/awkwardness between us we pushed on. He told me “that I was perfect but the timing for us to be together just wasn’t right.” I agreed with him and he told me he wanted to stay friends with me because he really liked me as a person. Then his gf made us all dinner and we ate together. I actually thought she was really cool and liked talking to her a lot too. 

When I woke up from this dream I wasn’t sad at all. I felt really good about it and what we talked about. I feel like my subconscious gave me closure on this since I know I’ll never have it irl. It honestly makes me really happy to think about because this is something that hindered me for years in my Romantic relationships. I would also get so mad at myself for still getting upset over how things ended with a shitty guy when I’m with the love of my life who treats me so good. 

Hopefully it stays this way but I truly do finally feel at peace over it. Like I can just close that chapter for good and move on from it completely. It’s a total breathe of fresh air and relief.",1569963909.0

I am a vivid dreamer who has had lucid dreams, recurring dreams, dreams where the guy in the black hooded cloak with no face was at the end of my bed even though I woke up, etc.  I am pretty good at understanding what they mean.  I am pretty spiritual as well, and can decipher between what is spiritually related and what is from my subconscious...if that makes any sense.

Last night I had a very vivid dream of being in a pet store, just looking around.  Next thing I know, a white rabbit has hopped over to me and is nipping my ankles.  I pick it up and it snuggles into me and I remember holding it and petting it the entire time.  It felt more than just a pet and that it was meant to be with me and my family.  I told my husband to look into its care and he said we can get it.  I said “But it’s so much work” and was concerned I’d be the only one caring for it.  However, I felt a deep connection to this rabbit.  Then I woke up without knowing what happened. 

Any insight into this?  I’m kind of at a loss and all information is greatly appreciated.  Thank you!",1569975956.0

994,Dreams about a Lost Friendship.,1,dbx8xo,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/dbx8xo/dreams_about_a_lost_friendship/,0,"A little over a year ago, my relationship with a good friend completely broke off. I was absolutely distraught because there was nothing I could have done to prevent this other than allowing her to gaslight me and keep apologizing for things I didn’t do/didn’t remember doing. We had been friends for about 4 years, were writing a book together, and we became roommates our second semester in college. She decided that didn’t work for her. I was hurt, but I tried to keep our relationship going. Well, a lot of stuff happened, I’ll just leave it at that. 

Over the summer, she ended up asking basically for full rights to the book we had been writing together for four years. She wanted to offer me 20% of the profits. We ended up never talking about it because I still wanted to write and she clearly didn’t want me to. We were going to work it out, but we just never talked with each other to do so. I didn’t see her that next year at college either, but I had constant dreams about her. Us yelling at each other, becoming friends again, me trying and failing to work things out. Anything that was a scenario that could happen but just never ended in closure. I always felt horrible waking up.

I saw her on campus again a couple weeks ago and my heart stopped. We passed each other. We didn’t say a word. I’ve been avoiding that path ever since. I saw her again one other time, completely skirted around her to avoid interaction. Maybe I’m a coward. I don’t know. I’d been trying not to let any old feelings come back. Until last night.

Last night I had a dream. She called me up around 1 am (I still have her in my phone so this isn’t necessarily unrealistic.) She told me she needed help. I got up out of bed, got dressed, and drove an hour to get her and take her back to my house. The car ride was silent other than her asking me not to take her home. My family wasn’t home (I don’t know why since it was like 2 am but hey it’s a dream so whatever.)

So I took her up to my room and she just starts bawling. She’d been having issues at home and she was just distraught over it. I tried to comfort her as best I could while still keeping my distance. When she calmed down (it was about 3:30 am in my dream at this point), she asked if we could get together again to work on the book. I wanted to. I love that book. But I said no. She instantly got angry and started yelling at me. Why not? Why wouldn’t I do it? 

I explained that I was still hurt. I didn’t understand why she didn’t want me writing in the first place. Sure, I had schedule conflicts. I had a job and she didn’t, that’s her choice. I needed a job but that didn’t mean I was going to not have one just because the book *might become popular. Even if it did, it wouldn’t give me money immediately. She felt that I needed to get over it. I explained it wasn’t just that. It was how she treated me. Making me think I did things I didn’t remember doing (this has never happened around anyone else, but I still believed her). Telling me I would get irrationally angry and try to hurt her, threaten her and myself, and just do things I didn’t remember at all. But hey, she was my friend. She wouldn’t lie. Well in my dream, I was explaining that I couldn’t get over that. I couldn’t just... forget.  

So then she starts bringing up more things that I did wrong. Again, I didn’t remember any of it. Like going through her clothes or stealing her stuff, etc, etc. In real life, she’d never actually accused me of these things, but dream her was just going off on me. At this point, we’re just screaming at each other. Then, my parents got home (they were the ones that convinced me to maybe not believe her in the first place), and she just starts sobbing again. Running over to me and hugging me. Trying to make the situation look like she didn’t mean it, she’s just upset. I tried comforting her again, but I just felt so... lost.

This is the most vivid dream I’ve had of seeing her again. At that point I woke up. On one hand, I feel a little more closure over saying no to her. Explaining why I wouldn’t continue on as friends, etc. On the other hand, I can tell I’m still hurt. I didn’t hesitate to go get her, nor did I hesitate to comfort her, even after we’d been screaming at each other. I just don’t know how to feel about this dream. It was just... strange. So yeah, long post. I just really needed to express my thoughts on it somewhere, and an anonymous app seemed like the best option.",1569982482.0

This dream I had last night and I’m having some trouble remembering all the details, but here’s the gist. If anyone has any ideas at all for interpretation, I’d greatly appreciate them.

I’m at some office building. One of my teeth (just one) falls out—or, more accurately, I pull it out by accident while trying to feel it because I had a toothache there. I wrap the tooth up in some cloth that gets soaked with blood, and the tooth has blood on it too. But no blood is in my mouth (which even in the dream I found odd).

For some reason I go to a pediatric dentist (I think he was nearest). This is a short older man with grayish hair and maybe glasses. Nothing like my own dentist (a young woman), I should note. He tells me not to worry and keeps me waiting for a long time. I’m wondering if he can just put the tooth back into the socket and everything will be OK. Eventually he tells told me to lie down on an operating table. I keep thinking I have some rare disease.

Then I woke up, at about 2 in the morning, frantically checking my teeth to see if they were all still there. Despite that, I wasn’t actually “scared” in-dream; I only freaked out when I woke up.",1569982028.0

Tony then jumped from a building but I didn't believe it was suicide because he still had me and Garrett so why would we do that? So I quit school because I believed something was going on there because suddenly other people started dying too. 

Then my friend Holly quit too and tried to drive us home but we were being chased by what I can only describe as undead demon things.
