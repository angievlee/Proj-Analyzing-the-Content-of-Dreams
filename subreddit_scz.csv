2,Hurting loved ones,10,dhsf49,schizophrenia,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/dhsf49/hurting_loved_ones/,10,"korba went insane for about a month. big surprise. but during this time he was a complete asshole to his SO and dumped her and got back together, just to dump her again.

korba's mind understood that she's not who she pretends to be and has really dark intentions towards him. he knew he used to have such delusions, but this time they took complete control.

now korba is left with a pretty broken relationship, not knowing how to fix things. maybe it's better to end it once and for all, just to avoid more hurt down the road. but korba loves her, so while he's not convinced that she's the devil, he wants to be with her more than anything in life.

fuck schizophrenia, delusions, paranoia. I can handle fearing people reading my mind, inserting thoughts, being unable to work for hours at a time, but when you hurt someone you love, that's just unfair. fuck you, universe. and please forgive korba.",1571096846.0

First concrete thing he says is “I don’t think you have a psychotic disorder” saying that I suffer from major anxiety, which I have no history of any anxiety related issues ever, and this guy is an intern at my school, not in a position to be giving diagnosis.

Not saying I WANT to be schizophrenic I just want some validation and the more he talked the less it sounded like me or what I’m going through. Should I see a psychiatrist? I didn’t schedule another appointment and am probably just gonna ignore it. It’s been getting worse and I just wanted help. He wasn’t interested, he couldn’t even keep eye contact I can just tell he didn’t believe me.

Ive tried different things like a book with short stories so if i do t read for a while i can pick it up again and start in a new story and not get annoyed about what the book was about. But even then its difficult. After years of netflix i need the visual stimulation i guess. 
So i got the next best thing. Comic books (batman to be specific) ive grown out of comic books when i was about 10-11 (asterix and disney comics) but after joker i found an interesting character and decided to give that a go. 
Its pretty easy. Its still “reading” but also having visuals so i dont get bored reading descriptions of rooms and people.
Slowly trying to train focusing on text more and more (netflix has subtitles in dutch but i rarely read them because my english is good)

Fast forward to a month or so after we were going out, he once asked me if I had slept with this common friend of ours. I was so surprised by the question because there was no way he could've known about it. And he told me just figured out by the way we act together, which was strange, because I really think we act more or less the same as before, and even if we acted slightly different it was not enough info as to jump to the conclusion that we had slept together.

Fast forward some months again, after he told me he had sz, he told me that it was not him who found out I had slept with our common friend, that it was somebody else telling him (not irl, in his mind). 

So my question is, do hallucinations and voices ever ""help"" you reading other people and just be more perceptive about the world around you? Or is just bad stuff overall?

I hope I don't bother anyone with this question, I'm just curious tbh",1571089594.0

Today I’m done and I quit. Much of the reason why I want to is because I’m about 15 lbs overweight and about 25 lbs away from where I’d like to be and accomplishing that has become far more important to me than drinking alcohol.  I can maintain my weight while drinking but I cannot lose weight and that is more important.

I (tbh) I even waited for it. What I mean is that it got normal for me to see things like heads where others saw nothing. My brain gave me a break for about 3 weeks now and it began again! I'm siting here on my Desktop, parents sleeping, it's 2 am and i can't sleep cuz that girl and the heads are watching me. I LOVE IT. Who wouldn't love the thougts of some one murdering u in a couple of seconds or someone standing right behind u, a knife in his hands about to murder u.

To calm down I even put the lights on.

Just because I want to relax a little bit I am going to talk about them here:        (as if u wouldn't already know ;)    )

\- The Girl:            She is watching me most of the time at night or when I am sleeping. She even looks like the Horror Movie Stereotype Girl. Her hair in front of her face so I can't see it. White dress and jsut standing in corners most of the time.

The ""faces"":        Some Abstract faces I see in ""flashbacks"" or i would call them ""flashmemories"". Some memories of another world, memories that aren't mine.

\- The Man:       He (that creepy asshole) is always standing behind me. FUCKING ALWAYS MAN! He even follows me in my Dreams. He counts as one of the Shadows but he is somehow a guy that never changes his look.

\- The Shadows: The Shadows are something like an own race and they are always different in shape except for ""The man"" I mentioned before. Those bitches are watching me very often. Some of them got a BIG smile (Horror Stereotype like)

\- The Eyes of the walls: I don't see these eyes very often but if I do It creeps the sh\*t out of me.

My thoughts aren't even mine someone is controlling them BUT sometimes my own thoughts leak through... So ""I"" don't only think that I should kill myself or punch my self as hard as I can.

I'm switching from seroquel to abilify as part of a research study, the study in question is basically about sexual activity and antipsychotics.

I've been on seroquel around 2 years now I think, and I was taking 1 300mg in the morning and 1 in the evening. It basically knocked me out so they switched me to 1 XL slow release seroquel. 

I've tapered down to 150mg a day and I feel much better fatigue wise but the nightmares and shadows are back. 

Reason for my post is basically to see how people find/found abilify. It's apparently pretty good for weight control and sex life compared to what I'm on at the moment, but I just wanna from you guys how you found it? 

I'm pretty nervous about the switch as some of my symptoms are creeping back, but god knows I'd like to lose some weight (I'm not that big as I'm 6'1 and I carry it well, plus i workout so that helps somewhat) and actually enjoy sex again, maybe even look forward to getting out of bed.

Let me preface this by saying I do not have schizophrenia. I recently watched the show Undone and was really curious what you guys thought about it. I thought it was so beautiful and sort of devastating, but of course I can't speak to its accuracy. 

another thing was that I interpreted it as a story through the eyes of someone developing schizophrenia, but i saw an interview with the writer and it seems she is really going the route of ""mental illness opens you up to supernatural things"". I have to say I felt a bit disappointed by this. I actually wondered if that might be a somewhat sketchy message, given that i've read that those with schizophrenia can have trouble distinguishing what's real or not, and perhaps seeing a show that could reinforce a delusion would be a setback.

But I feel like since I have a lot of insight and my hallucinations and few and far between, that I'm making it all up?

Like, maybe I just want attention or to have a ""real"" diagnosis (I currently am in the hospital for depression, and have been since March. Which feels like a ""not-real"" diagnosis because it's not able to be seen.)

A couple of years ago I believed there were shadow people following me, and I didn't leave my house until I was forced to by my mom, and came back home when she recognized I was having a breakdown. I didn't tell anyone about the shadow people, and ripped up and destroyed the drawings and writing I made about all that. Because I think I made it up for attention or something? Maybe to make myself feel better or special? I also can't remember this time very well.

And sometimes I hear voices, like people talking in a diner, or someone calling my name. Usually when it's quiet. I feel like my brain is just trying to fill the silence though. And I recognize that it's not real. And it doesn't happen super often.

I also have periods of time that I believe I'm in hell/purgatory. Or that I'm the only real person, or this is all a simulation or something. But most of the time I only kind of entertain the idea, I rarely- if ever- believe it fully. Just kind of.

Writing all this down, I honest to god think I'm doing this for attention or to have a real diagnosis. Maybe none of this is real. Maybe I'm doing this because my family might take me seriously now? I don't know.

I **will** tell my doctor, and I brought up a very little portion of this to my therapist, but I want to know what you guys think? And please, please consider that I'm lying or something. Or making it up. Not maliciously, but I really can't believe that this is real. I don't fucking know.

I have developed an uncommon (but not super uncommon) iatrogenic reaction to anti-psychotics that means in the people that have this syndrome, anti-psychotics worsen psychosis long-term. I can explain the science for anyone interested, but my doctor and I have been working on going down for a while, so it is not like I'm just impulsively ""going off my meds""—I am doing this with the support and guidance of a physician and we are going down slowly and safely.

I think if I can get over my brain's dependency on anti-psychotics after taking them for 5+ years, I will have a great level of functioning because even before I ever took medication, I was actually functioning better despite the psychosis problems, but I feel now I have the psychotherapeutic tools to manage psychosis if it comes up without medication. Antipsychotic withdrawal, from what I've experienced, is brutal. But my doctor is going to add a mood stabilizer, which can alleviate the symptoms of anti-psychotic withdrawal. I will probably stay on the mood stabilizer for at least 6 months after the antipsychotic is at 0 to ensure I don't suffer rebound psychosis from the withdrawal.

There has been a lot of research to show that schizophrenics have higher long-term recovery rates with no to minimal medication. I think that is true. What do you guys recommend for managing symptoms that may come up during withdrawal or throughout my life off meds? Has anyone here done this before?

And the last time I posted something like this I got downvoted and no responses, so I want to affirm that I am absolutely not against medication; I just don't benefit from medication because of this uncommon iatrogenic syndrome. I support those of you who wish to remain on medication for life.

When I had a conversation I used to map out common variables of outcome for the conversation. It was easy to write poems and come up with stories. Even though I had seldom inspiration moments because I kept myself drained with cannabis. I have had voices in my head almost all of my childhood and so on. I started having problems because I started to do the observer/observed pychological excercise and started paying attention to those voices. That started with a dellusion that a friend told me that this voices had always been there but I didn't pay attention and thought I should start paying attention. Then I tried mushrrooms and hell broke loose. A whole alternate reality started made up of the ideas running my head recently. I was into gnosticism back then and used to go to a psychic that have me suspicious of his true abilities so he had me interested, studying him.

I've had stopped treatment in 3 occasions with the purpose of boosting creativity and basic analysis. But I had other problems like Daddy issues related to religion. Religion is what got me investigating the occult because I had the thought that darkness was the true source of power which is where God came from, so was curious what kind of findings these occult societies had found. And these problems exploded and also I been disconnected from my regular conversation in spot analysis was adapting to do so again everytime I was off meds. Rages and moods swings like bipolar disorder which were product of my never ending interior dramas. In the end I was taken for treatment against my will in all this events. In the last treatment I fell into apathy real hard and haven't been able to sustain activities, not even gaming. I spent almost a year buying the parts for my PC and it took a toll on me to have such a long process.

I've been thinking again about stopping treatment and right now switching to pills is very convenient because I wouldn't have to deal with long drive and also the cost of paying the doctor. But I fear that I could try to stop again if I go the pill route once more. I really dislike and resent my treatment course because I was treated like I had no say in anything, first off doctors didn't tell me how different I would feel and didn't show any experience with the drug I use. So I'm always thinking I really have depression and should medicate accordingly and this was my first diagnosis. I have never in my life thought this were real voices but instead it was like when someone read and repeats the words in the mind.

That's what I really want, with lithium (I think) the voices where faint and faded with ease, I had all my feelings and wasn't so apathetic.

87,Needing medication advice. I'm desperate.,7,dgpt60,schizophrenia,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/dgpt60/needing_medication_advice_im_desperate/,2,"Hi everyone, this is my first post here, so forgive me if there are any mistakes. I found this subreddit a few months ago, and it's helped me feel like I'm not so alone in this and has given me some understanding of my illness. But now I have a problem and didn't know where else to turn, so I'm hoping some of you can help me out. I was diagnosed at age 17, (9 years ago), and have been on medications intermittently since. As of a few months ago, I made the decision to try it again and was put on Vraylar 1mg, later to be increased to 3mg. At first, things were going well, it gave me energy and took away my visual and auditory hallucinations more than any other medication has before. It even had a positive effect on my paranoia that everyone is out to get me. 

But as the months have gone on, I have become more and more paranoid, severely depressed, and extremely tired all the time (just to name a few). The exhaustion came first, then came the depression. Oh, and my concentration is absolutely awful, to the point that it's become difficult to even count money or change. I can't sit still long enough to read a book, nor can I retain any of the information I just read. It's become infuriating and depressing to just get through the day.

So, I have decided that I want to stop taking it. But I'm worried about coming off of it, because of my previous experience of withdrawing off of Geodon. I never want to go through that again. But I can't keep going on like this. I'm not even sure if I want to switch to another medication, considering my last interaction with my doctor. She humiliated me in front of the whole staff and patients in the waiting area all due to their appointment scheduling mistake. But that isn't important right now. 

If any of you have been on Vraylar or have any suggestions or advice as to what I should do, then please let me know. I don't want to be on this medication any longer, and you guys are the only ones who I feel can understand what I'm going through. 

Thank you for listening, and I hope someone out there can help me out.",1570879868.0

I haven't talked to my therapist or loved ones about it because in the past couple of years I've become really attatched to some of these ""people"" and I don't know if I want to get rid of them.

I'm only typing this because I've upped my medication and I don't know what's real and what isn't. They *seem* so real to me but at the same time I know it can't be possible.

Of course my socal media feeds were filled with people disclosing about anxiety, depression, cptsd, and some bipolar dxs. When I didn't share anything I was accused privately of this refusal being the result of internalized stigma, and contributing to wider societal stigma. I don't exactly feel that I owe anyone any explanations, and I'm not required to educate anyone about my life and my diagnosis. But I'm stuck on these comments. Maybe to some degree this is about internalized stigma, I am still coming to terms with my diagnosis -- although I'm getting there. To some degree this is certainly fear of stigma and the potential real world repercussions of other people finding out my dx. But to what degree am I contributing to wider societal stigma by not being more open about my diagnosis? If everyone remains silent it's impossible to try to overcome this stigma. And it makes it that much harder for others to be open about their diagnoses. And now I feel like a bad person for failing to stand up and be more open about this.

104,Struggling with being honest with my family about my symptoms because someone who was completely evil and also happened to have a history of schizophrenia stabbed my cousins grandmother. Sorry for long post.,16,dgfbd5,schizophrenia,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/dgfbd5/struggling_with_being_honest_with_my_family_about/,6,"So, a few days ago, my cousins grandmother got stabbed 15 times by a family friend whom she has known a long time, who we didn't know was a complete psychopath. Yes, she did have schizophrenia too, but she didn't stab her because she had a psychotic break. The police found her diary where she had written down her plans to murder her and her entire family (including all of the kids), so that she could have my uncle Eric all to herself. She also stabbed her while naked, so that she wouldn't have any evidence left on her. It worked too, the only evidence the police have is the diary.  I am sorry, she wasn't mentally ill when she stabbed her. She is evil. She knew what she was doing when she did it,  planned it out, and feels no remorse for wanting, and trying, to kill multiple people. 

My cousins are of course all reeling from this, and I feel so terrible for the pain their family is going through right now. Luckily, she survived and is in the ICU recovering. 

I am worried, that if my cousins ever find out that I am being evaluated for schizo spectrum disorders (which I most likely have), that they will think that I am the same as her, and view me as an evil monster too. I love my family very much, and I don't want them to be afraid of me. 

I am further worried, because the major delusion that I used to struggle with is that I am a psychopath who will inevitably kill people. I am worried that this will trigger that delusion to return. 

My cousin wants to talk to me, and ask about how my symptoms are doing. We initially thought that what I was suffering from was neuro in origin, but now are suspecting it is mental illness. He had heard that I had been hospitalized back in April for pseudo seizures, and so that is what he is asking about. What should I tell him? It seems like a terrible time to be honest about how I am actually doing. My mom is encouraging me to not say anything about my struggles. Is that good advice?",1570829968.0

Her previous mental health history is mostly just anxiety and depression. We had to check her into the hospital, but as expected they put her on Seroquel until she was a zombie, but still equally delusional, and then switched her to invega 6mg and discharged her (I'm guessing they were over dealing with it). 
Ever since she's been completely frozen, ridged, eyes rolled up at the ceiling, repeating the same 3 things. ""I am god"" ""this is stupid"" ""I understand"". She's also been throwing up and I don't think she's slept more than 5 hours total in the last two weeks. Despite my study in this field and experience with psychosis, this is still horrible to watch. Am I crazy or does this mean that antipsychotics are clearly NOT working? 

I suffered psychosis with delusions a few years ago, not as severe, but antipsychotics made everything way worse, mirtazipine and Valium ultimately helped me. 

I know antipsychotics have lasting effects and if she is responding this way can this permanently damage her?

We have no idea what to do, because these psych wards are literally shit and they just drug up all of their patients until they're barely conscious enough to function and then discharge them to get rid of them.  There doesn't seem to be a good place that will take her and monitor her enough to realize the antipsychotics aren't working.

Also were unsure if this is a schizophrenia showing up, or a psychotic break from smoking a lot of weed with a history of mental health issues. Her and I are both the same as in if we smoke we have panic attacks but she would all of the time regardless and I know habitual use can cause this.

Soteria is modeled after a program started in California in the 70s by Loren Mosher - it's medication-neutral (not encouraging anybody to take meds if they don't want to and investing in alternative therapies like massage, group discussion, art, peer support, and meditation - although you can certainly take meds if you so choose) and most of the staff are peers in that they've experienced mental illness in their lifetime. Some have schizophrenia. The original Soteria is now defunct due to lack of funding, but there are Soterias all over the world modeled after it. There is currently only one in the United States - the one I'm going to - in Burlington Vermont.

Now I'm going back! I just got the news yesterday that I'd been accepted back into the program. I'll probably be there for 3 or 4 months. 

I'm on Abilify 30mg and Invega Sustenna 234mg (both max doses) and I do plan to keep taking my meds, although my doctor and I have planned to discuss reducing my dosage of Abilify at my next appointment on Wednesday. 

I'm really excited to be moving in. I'm not REALLY an ideal candidate for the program since it's really intended for people experiencing their first bout of psychosis and who are medication-naive, while I've been sick for two and a half years and taking meds almost since the beginning (have been on twelve different antipsychotics in that time). Still, they're letting me back mainly as a way to increase my connection to community, since my psychiatrist has identified isolation as the primary factor in my repeated pattern of hospitalization, discharge, increased symptoms, hospitalization again. I live in a studio apartment and see nobody other than my parents once a week, my case manager once a week, and my psychiatrist once a week. I don't go outside except on Wednesday mornings to walk to the clinic.

I was diagnosed 10 years ago at age 19. Been on a wide range of anti psychotics many with detrimental effects nearly costing me my life. I have been symptom free for 2 years and now to a certain degree negative symptom as well. What I did worked for me and may not work for you and there are risks involved in doing what im doing. I began taking etizolam 3 mg daily 2 years ago. Within a week I no longer had delusions or voices/intruding thoughts. It all went away. Completely. I stayed on my anti psychotic (risperidone) and still am unable to get off it due to rebound psychosis from the withdrawal so I continue to take it. I make sure I have a constant supply of the etizolam as the withdrawal is potentially fatal as it is a thienodiazepam. I wouldn't trade that risk though for being psychotic all the time again as it was a living hell and I was unable to function. 2 years ago I was living at a friends house a total wreck. Now I live on my own, own a car and starting a career in IT. My life is back on track. Yes I have to take the etizolam the rest of my life but there are very few serious long term side effects especially compared to the risperidone I have to take the rest of my life. Anyway I just wanted to share with you all a medication that got my life back on track and saved me from the waking nightmare that is schizophrenia. Not saying it will work for you but I thought Id share it as it was a turning point for me in dealing with this illness. im happy to answer any questions if any of you are interested.",1570799926.0

134,House of cards.,7,dg4jgo,schizophrenia,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/dg4jgo/house_of_cards/,2,"Delusions build off of each other like a house of cards.  This is both good and bad.  It's good because you can bring it down by targetting the deepest foundational delusions but it's bad because you can pick up the cards and rebuild.

In my experience the house of cards can remain intact after being medicated.  Delusions persist even when on meds.  So the struggle of overcoming them has to come from within and this is where the challenge lies.  It takes conscious effort.

For starters, anyone who wants to dismantle the house of cards should work from the top down and not make the whole thing collapse because that is a great way to have an existential crisis.  What this means practically is that you don't have to immediately go and say everything I believe is a lie and have your worldview come crashing down.  You don't even need to accept you have delusions at first but you should make a conscious effort to give them less power over your life.  

Example time...

When I was suffering psychotic episodes I frequently thought that there was a game being played and I was one of the players.  I called it the devils game because I thought I was playing against the devil.  In the hospital I made a conscious effort to get better and one thing I did that was a milestone in the recovery was to stop playing the game.  Not stop believing the game exists but within the context of that delusion, giving it less power over my life.  So the house of cards was intact from the bottom up since I was still believing in the game but I took the card that represents my belief in playing the game away and it made me feel less distressed.  Once you get one card down it becomes easier to get another one down and slowly but surely the house of cards will be dismantled.",1570770319.0

And the cultural tradition of india,5,dg568c,schizophrenia,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/dg568c/the_psychoanalysis_of_a_teen_turned_youth_and_his/,0,"Today I have decided to quit porn forever , i.e , 11th of October, for my own good health ,both mental and physical. I have been trying to quit for past few days very seriously but the gravity and longevity of my addiction holds much more than its levity and evanescence. For I know that it's nothing compared to what I can achieve in my real life but the allure of porn always push me toward it for it being easily accessible and my past experience of abstaining from it causing schizophrenia which I will elaborate later. I have been watch porn regularly after I had relapsed one year back on 23rd of April which was a consequence of my mental health deterioration and I was taken to a hospital for my mental check up. There I had the voices in my head telling me that all the nurses and doctors are trying to seduce me in my thought and that was the urge that I gave into which made my addiction to reemerge and that would take another 2 year for me to decide not to watch it again today and by writing it in my phone made me look like more serious of giving upto these urges. 
I have written down my secrets that a few know and those secrets are not known to a single person. It's like opening your inner self to one person , and then opening your much darker secret to somebody else. The person I most believe in is my friend who I know would abandon me whenever he is put to test. Maybe that assumptions is for myself as I am known to abandon friends and acquaintances whenever they are in need of. I have always believed myself to be hard willed , sharp in mind , and to leave anything which I found to be not much worthy of my respect and time  . But I have turned out to be wrong . I will lead from now with a story that you may find intriguing. Maybe my lack of word power in English can make me incompetent of telling my story in a more comprehensive manner but nevertheless I will proceed:-
There was a time when I was young and restless. I had all the desire of being successful and to have the knowledge of the world . And for that I started to read everything that would come up to me even the match sticks. I found reading to be much more valuable than anything else even the family . This was the time when I was around 12. I had not explored the world , even now I haven't but with the technology in my hand now I am trying to garner as much knowledge as I can then to try to pass it to others about how the exploitative mindset of our own leaders, you can also call them guide if you are on that side of spectrum where you conform to every single things that's mainstream, leads us to our own destruction, morally and ethically , like sleeping with girls and exploiting them as done by our own Mahatma Gandhi , even though I haven't read his autobiography , I can tell that from what I have heard of his writing about his sexual deviation and his desire to check this by sleeping with two teenage girls , which made our society so downgraded that I feel shame whenever I walk on this wretched land of mine , i.e India. For you may have heard of India and it's view of sex as a taboo to be discussed in open. It is the thing people take pleasure from in night but in day it's like there's nothing called sex and there is so much shame running around in this country about sex that I would suspect even the most progressive of writers like Nivedita Menon take upon herself to break the taboo around it. I , therefore , respect a much better writer , i.e Arundhati Roy , who is far more open about taking up issues like this to bring it in open. I guess this would have to do with their differentt backgrounds and both being from a Brahman family, I guess that would have to do with their experiences with it , one conforming to norms and other breaking it. Befor I proceed to my story I have a story to tell of this two writers which I have made up in mind .
Suppose there are two girls from same family, a lower caste shudra family. One who is far more expressive than her sister. And other is just going with the flow but within her harbouring a much more rebel nature in her to revolt against anything that comes up her way. One is against a one section of inequality and other against the whole system. Whom would you support ?Let me help you by giving you some more example . One has watched her mother , her sister , other women being oppressedby their male counterparts , not just their counterparts , they are being ‘oppressed’ by their own children that is male . And the other one who has watched the suffering of both and much more the sexual exploitation of girls and boys alike , one boy might be her brother, and both have spoken openly about this when they got to know the nature of the suppression , it’s effect on the mental health and their physical stuntness which has caused to behave more like an insane person . Whom would you support? For me I have chosen the latter one to be my guide because in this epoch of India , i.e 2019, I believe that suppression happened on both side , maybe one has material gains which can be obtained from oppression but the other has spiritual gain which can be only obtained through suppression of other's feelings because they have been devoided of the material gain. It is my opinion only . I don't think of you conforming to my illusion but nevertheless I will proceed .  The fact that one has been spiritually suppressed can be best understood as the number of intellectuals that are really intellectuals being women . And the number of materialist who are men. From this perspective I have gained insight on the spiritual nature and material nature. Now with two girls . One who is wholly for the spiritual gains decided to point out the material inequalities that have been bequeathed on women , because gaining spirituality has become her nature , her intrinsic one as is embedded in her through long years of oppression of her kind . And the brother I talked about totally in for the material gains decided to point out the spiritual incapability of his only to gain more material as has become his intrinsic nature . But one who has found a silver lining between these two and set out a path for herself , for she is the seeker of truth , decided to point out the system and in every circumstances giving a hand to oppressed or suppressed like his brother and sister who have taken the path of their destiny without ever questioning it. I have not specified upon the brother because I don't find myself gaining control over material thing , for I know spirituality preceds materialism .if you have been spiritual enough then you might not need look for the material. But for surviving material is also necessary which I think have been forgotten by the oppressed section that have come to their mind rather late.But the economy is run by materialist which I think have been so suppressed that they might have took a dive in the darker areas of human nature which is what ruining us or might be making more knowledgeable about our dark ambitions. That's why I am going to be focused on the two sisters. For it is a positive article which I have written for myself to make me come out of the dark. Now the two girls I am talking about are Nivedita Menon and Arundhati Roy both excellent in their own domain. But I guess I would rather walk a silver lining than to go treading on the positive area because for me I can't even I try to because I have spent so much time in the negative areas,i.e materialistic in nature , that it might not be possible to me walk on that positive area because there is also suffering and pain. Pain adjoines everyone irrespective of what they might be doing , even a sleep can cause pain , a pain of time lost. Therefore it is imperative to me to first find a silver lining at which I can cling my faith onto because it's the only place that one can keep an eye on and stretch their hands for because on the both negative and positive areas there is not much to hold onto. One's a deep sea where you have to dive in without putting a oxygen mask on waiting for to last your breath but if you have that insight that you can't go further you hope for the surface and that is what for me is a silver lining. And the other one is the sky where you have not yet learnt to fly but will only hope so when you are at the surface . So for me this silver lining is important . For this silver lining will open the scope for my further growth. I have desire of leaving the silver lining as soon as I reach there but in the contrary I have the desire of going every length of that silver lining and explore it then learn to fly . For me that brother is deep into the sea and yet he is the king of the underworld he can negotiate with the queen of the sky to give him passes which can make him fly for a brief period of time and he can in return help her elder sister dive into sea and explore it for a short period. But the one who is at the silver lining has to suffer her for eternity even though there is no suffering here but we can never know what suffering means to someone who has not experienced any suffering . For her it might be the suffering of not feeling suffering. There's another girl , who is the 3rd sister , on the silver lining which work cooperatively with her at the other end in holding the line. Both have come from different area of experience , one has the experience of sea and one has the experience of sky but they decided to not go further and settle down at the surface and help the people coming from death or life to go into the other world.i have only decided to make the two girls my main character because they are much loved by the so called intellectuals who wants to fly into the sky but to also know the little secrets about the sea .

I've noticed my mood getting lower and lower while I've tried to keep it together. But all I can think about is doing what the voices say. I've thought about the ways I would do it. It's stuck in my head on a loop. Constant images of what would happen during and the aftermath.

I don't know what to do. I've started cleaning my room just incase so my mam doesn't have to go through that. I feel so much guilt. I feel incredibly selfish that I'm even thinking about this.

To clarify I have been stable since getting on my current medication roughly 7 or 8 years ago so I have only been going to the offices once every 3 months for the last 4 or 5 years. Since I go to a clinic my doctors change fairly frequently. I have had like 5 different doctors over the past 4 years. Anyway, I realized with one in particular that she would never participate in the conversation, no matter what I brought up I could feel her trying to dissect what I was saying. It didn't matter if I was bringing up my change of employment or how my classes were going she would always respond in one of two ways. either audibly ""hmmming"" to acknowledge she heard me or responding with ""and how does that make you feel?"" For the longest time I couldn't figure out why it bothered me then when I was talking with my current doctor I realized as I said that I didn't get along that well with this past doctor, in particular, because I felt that no matter what I brought up she was searching everything I said  for a hint of psychosis.",1570725447.0
151,People with Schizophrenia who are currently on anti-psychotic medication: How long did it take for you to overcome negative symptoms and could you think faster when it was over?,9,dfvanc,schizophrenia,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/dfvanc/people_with_schizophrenia_who_are_currently_on/,4,"I think that the anti-psychotic meds have something to do with me not being as fun, witty, full of ideas, great memory, etc. as I used to be. I think it makes me think slower. But then I think that my sickness made me think super fast when I was psychotic and the meds are just evening out how my mind works and gears it down to a level that is at the normal speeds of a normal mind and that would mean that after my negative symptoms are over with (my health professionals keep saying they will be over with in the future) I would be able to be fun, witty, full of ideas, great memory, etc. again, and stay on the dosage that helped me get free from psychosis without hallucinations and delusions. Am I wrong? There must be hope. I'm so afraid of going down in the current anti-psychotic medicine dosage of 2 mg in the morning and 2 mg in the evening. Edit: But my fast thinking mind isn't constant and slows down when psychosis is over so eventually meds would have to be regulated so that the anti-psychotics don't slow down my mind too much. Edit2: But my mind might have adapted so it can tolerate the effects of the anti-psychotics so my mind will be okay after I've overcome the negative symptoms.

For example, cigarette smoke means God is calling me a coward, lentils means God is upset at me, piss means God is angry, diesel is God super angry, and a sweet smells means I'm a deceiver or the devil. I started to believe this was really God and I basically became the smell's bitch and allowed it to control me. I hated it so much but because I thought it was God I developed a Stockholm syndrome to it. And guess what it did, the smells stabbed me in the back. One day I got angry at religion (so much weird stuff in the bible I can't stand) and I got the diesel smell, then I said whatever I'm going to heaven and I got the deceiver smell. I became convinced for weeks that God had sealed my fate and I was going to hell. Then one day I told the smells to fuck off and that they are not God. God is not a dictator who would send me to hell for objecting to a line in the bible, or plague me with smells of shit and piss for months.

There were about 2-3 nights a week were i just DIDNT sleep. It was really hard. My dr wanted to give me benzos for it but i refused because meds dont solve everything. For some reason this stabilized where if i went to bed at 23:00 i would sleep at 23:30-00:00
Since last week monday. This stopped. I wouldnt fall asleep until 6 am. And this has been the same every day since then. I have no stress or anxiety or whatever. Everything stayed the same. It just happened. 
Its really annoying because i tend to sleep until like 15:00 now because if i wake up at 8 to set it straight i start having symptoms because sleeping 2 hours a night isnt exactly helpful.
I do sleep enough. Its just that all my friends go to bed at like 23:00 and then im stuck by myself for most of the night. I tried reading a book but that doesnt work. Meditating doesnt work. A few days ago i was drinking with friends. Which made me sleep sooner but thats not a long term solution.
And i really dont want sleep medication because those are generally addictive and just knock you out and dont help you actually rest because it messes with the sleep cycles.

If I were to stop my meds maybe then I would see it from my doctors perspective and realise I do need the meds.

I'm just tired. I'm confused. I feel like I brought all this on myself. I don't want to go on clozapine but my options were switch back to seroquel (which I hated) or come off my current meds and start Clozapine.

I'm scared because I want to stay on the meds I'm on but if I refuse seroquel or clozapine they can easily force me, it's happened before. They've threatened me with the police before. I don't want to go to hospital. I don't want to be in this situation and sometimes I don't even want to be alive.

But I noticed a cycle. Near the end of the month, when my injection wears off, I become very angry at God and disbelieving. My psychosis is tied directly to the belief of hell, and there is a negative correlation between my belief in hell and my belief in God. So when I'm psychotic, I think I'm going to Hell (or possibly am already in Hell) despite not being religious and not believing in God.

Which makes me wonder--did the antipsychotic CAUSE the belief in God or did the illness cause the disbelief? It's a chicken and egg situation, in a way. Which came first, my recovery, or the belief in Jesus? Did my belief cause my recovery or did my recovery cause my belief?

Disclaimer: I don't have Schizophrenia, however, I am extremely paranoid, and I think everyone is trying to kill me. When I enter new places, I always check where the entrances are and where I can sit so I always have an eye on everything.  


However, this post isn't about me.   


I tend to think ""*oh, I just think like this because of my childhood trauma*"".  


**Does anyone else think the same way about their Schizophrenia?** Of course not only childhood trauma but other things.

One time I thought a certain dating website were going to take legal action against me for hacking them (I didn't)

One time I thought a van had kidnapped my girlfriend

I used to think my coworkers were talking about my performance every time they had a meeting I wasn't invited to

I went 5 years thinking I had HIV

I went outside today for a smoke (first one in months - stress) and everybody was a robot. Subtle differences in how they acted and looked. I could tell. The people having lunch at Sweetwaters were robots, the people passing by me on the street and muttering ""kill yourself"" to me were robots. 

I have an appointment with my psychiatrist tomorrow morning. Morning is a dangerous time to be outside. I have to leave my apartment at 6:40. I can't skip it - I HAVE to go because I need to get that Invega shot I missed last week, or the microchip will definitely become a problem again. I have too many problems already.

Because since being admitted to hospital last year I've been on some insane doses of antipsychotic medication. Throughout being on and off meds & switching multiple times I've always believed the doses I've been on have been unnecessary. I don't consider my schizophrenia severe. However my doctors seem to believe I am on the more severe end and I jusut don't see it that way because I'm well on the meds.

But I know I'm not well now. The voices have become indistinguishable from reality. Because  I've tried so many meds that work for a while and then slowly stop working my final option, I've been told is to start Clozapine/Clozaril which I've read is a last resort drug for treatment resistant schizophrenia.

Maybe I'm in denial. Maybe I'm deluded. I just can't get my head around this. I have a week to think about it before I make my decision even though I feel like the decision has most likely already been made for me. Because my doctors aren't happy that my current combination of meds (Abilify & Olanzapine) are working and I can't really increase either as I'm almost at maximum dose.

I don't know what else to say. I'm confused. I can't trust the doctors because I don't think I'm really severe/treatment resistant but they think I am.

Away from home time
Leave the house as soon as I have breakfast as I want to do something and feel restless. At noonish.

Weekend: ask my dad or nan if I can come over to my nans house to watch tv with her. If my nan is not free I catch the bus or get my mum to drop me in town.

Arrive home at 2-4pm. I get social anxiety in town and hear voices on the bus home

Then go home and do the dishes

But recently just hit an unfound wave of depression. A hybrid wave. A massive fucking wave. I'm addicted to weed. I see myself being controlled by fucking demons. My most important interviews are coming up in days and I'm panicking so much. I'm having delusions that my dad killed my mom and she's screaming for me to help her. I'm getting in so many close calls while driving.

But it's okay. Tomorrow I'll wake up and it will all become regular again. My cries of help lie in my severe dehydration, b12 deficiency, and overall ass-kicking that I'm handing to my body. But for some reason, I won't pay attention to that either. I've been dehydrated for over 3 months now and at some points, I starved myself to the point where I was using body fat to meet equilibrium. My therapist is worried about me not eating enough, but I should let her know more about my dehydration. I talk to her tomorrow though so I'll actually let her know :))

When I drink water I feel like it's so foreign to my mouth that I see waves in my mouth when the water hits. When the water actually is in my mouth I feel like my tongue repels the water because it's so dry. I'm not fucking around, the water is repelled off of my tongue. This has partly been the reason why drinking water stopped being relevant in my life. I literally just won't realize that I'm not drinking water. With regards to the mention of relevancy in my life: I feel like I've started to rely on validating myself and my self-image, so I direct all my vibes and energy into my brain to supply myself all the validation I need to keep afloat.

I think the bittersweet part of this all is that I see myself inside. Even if I feel like I'm being controlled by my fucking demons, at least I know I'm still there. I'd rather know that I was actually there then just live as a demon without knowing for my whole life. And the real me is a real angel - they are. But I'm so far away from them in this hell, but they're an angel and they embody everyone here and all the beautiful people in the worlds. I try to learn from them as much as I can, but I don't see them very much. Now that I think of it my old friend in high school and I were talking about this demon idea at lunch. Weird how things connect together like that.

Edit: ""For the me that reads this later, don't dismiss this warning, please :(. Be yourself."" - I was originally going to edit this message into this post to make sure I remembered it when I was going over things with my therapist, but then I felt a dark force stand over my right shoulder commanding me to not write the reminder, THEY FUCKING COMMANDED ME. I deleted it and thought, ""oh that'd be weird if I put that in there"" - WRONG. I WAS NEARLY CONVINCED BY SATAN THROUGH MY WORLDLY ATTACHMENT. Why was I looking to avoid weirdness?? This world is so sick and confusing. I feel like I understand it, but I don't even know the start. RIP",1570527604.0

I sort of feel as if as society is becoming more open to the idea of anxiety and depression being illnesses, and fairly common ones at that, schizophrenia is being more and more misunderstood, because the fear that was once over all mental health problems has now been shifted further onto us.

I just got back from spending the weekend with my friend but he kept muttering under his breath saying bad things about me, then a policeman called me a ""nutjob"" into his radio as I walked past.

This all started when I developed social anxiety about 2 months ago. I stopped leaving the house for a long time. It got worse. Then everyone told me to leave the house more and things should improve. So I've been leaving the house more but what's happening is everyone laughs at me when I'm outside. So many people do it. I hear them laugh then I hear them say things related to me.

I'm tired of it. When I'm outside I'm uncomfortable all the time. It's getting worse not better. I've been having a lot of ruminations and thought loops. I ruminate about the past. I ruminate about the future. I worry about something bad happening to people I care about. I get the same thoughts in my head on a loop over and over again and I can't control it. Intrusive thoughts are the worst.

I was doing so well but maybe the stress of sharing my story publicly has finally gotten to me. I don't think I can do the public speaking jobs anymore. The first one was amazing, the second one the voices wouldn't leave me alone. So now I'm worried I've disappointed the people who asked me to do it to begin with.

I recently had my aunts come for my birthday and they were ridiculous. The were making fun of me acting kinda hostile. They just left and I'm so relieved but also saddened to think about what a great time we could of had if they would of been nice.

So basically a few of my family members have this ideal situation and I'm not included. 

I don't know what to do and how I can start living a little more independently. If I don't socialize with them they will blame mental health. They won't listen that they are why I don't want to be around them.

basically there are times where i will feel a bug burrowed behind my left eye. i can’t see it, but i can feel it moving back there. and then it digs it’s razor sharp claws into my eye, and it’s like it’s eating my eye from the inside. 

i naturally start to panic, and i start digging at my eye trying to get it out. even though i am well aware of my diagnosis, i’m not processing at the time that the bug isn’t real (as i’m sure virtually everyone here will understand). all i know is the pain i feel, and that a bug is causing it. 

anyways i will end up digging at my eye for like 45 minutes in straight up tears trying to get the bug out. usually the mucus lining or whatever it’s called starts leaking out of my eye socket, and my eye gets extremely blood red and swollen, and my vision is blurred from all the digging (i’m digging underneath my eye inside the socket, not scratching the actual eyeball). the bug keeps running around back there and i can’t get it, and then when i’ll stop for a cry break, it’ll dig fucking harder, literally eating my eye. 

the past few times i broke down on the floor straight up balling begging for help. came real close to having someone take me to the ER. i end up wrapping my head and eye in extremely tight bandaging so there’s pressure on it and i won’t be able to physically hurt myself anymore, and i lay down crying feeling this bug eat my fucking eye until suddenly my brain decides it doesn’t want to fuck with me anymore and the hallucination stops. then i look at myself in the mirror like “what the fuck have i done to myself”

so, do any of you have ideas on how i can keep myself from hurting myself when this happens? trying to remind myself it’s not real doesn’t do anything. the pain is very much real to me and that’s all that matters. i’m genuinely scared i’m going to end up causing serious trauma to my eye the next time i have this episode and that i might accidentally blind myself. how do you distract yourself and get through it?",1570448728.0

If you've ever tried explaining to someone why you're freaking out and panicking, why you can't at all focus on their words because there appears to be other people talking, why you often stare off like there's something just over their shoulder, or why you sometimes do things that you can't really explain (digging a screwdriver deep into my arm to pull out a camera), you get the frustration.

I'm not making it up like some child wanting their mother to play along. This, as far as I can tell without meds, is real. 
     
   
But no, I must just be pretending, or just afraid of some nightmare, according to them. I must just be one of those tin foil nuts that people always make fun of. I must not be genuinely suffering or struggling to keep a grasp on life from day to day. It must be fake because anyone that considers themselves to be normal do their best to remind me constantly that there's nothing there to them, so it must not be real.

Sorry this is a long post because I didn't want to leave out anything that might be important.   


**- I was diagnosed with depression about 3 years ago**  (I'm in my early 30's now) though I have probably suffered from this (**and anxiety**) my whole life and just didn't realize it - whenever I would mention the possibility of something being wrong with the way i was feeling or wrong with me, my family wouldn't take me seriously and didn't want me to take medication for anything because ""you dont want to mess with any of that stuff that'll screw with your brain"". Anyway when I was first diagnosed, I was horribly depressed and suicidal after suffering from job related loss and stress, accumulating in an overwhelming feeling of worthlessness. I currently think I'm still suffering from depression and anxiety but not nearly as bad as back then, and still currently take anxiety medication.  


**- I've suffered from insomnia** off and on over my lifetime, beginning in my 20s and continuing now. It usually is triggered by stress.   


**- I also have occasional sleep paralysis.** The hallucinations from that usually are just while I'm experiencing it, but on occasion after an experience I'll see something I saw in sleep paralysis out of the corner of my eye. In the very least it ""feels"" like it's still there/something is wrong. Everything will feel weird and ""off"" all day. I haven't had sleep paralysis in over a year thank god.   


**-  In my mid-to-late 20's I started getting increasingly paranoid**, my paranoia comes and goes but it usually revolves around work and/or strangers listening to me. I've thought in the past, as crazy as it sounds, that the administration at my work had bugged our desks or computers or something to listen in on what we were saying. Currently I believe they can somehow view anything we send over the wifi at work, and scan our emails. At my worst, I would experience things that would ""prove"" to me that these things were happening (ex: my self or someone mentioning something near a desk and soon after having an admin reference almost verbatim what had been said) I still have issues with eye contact and faces in general because I feel I'm constantly being judged.  


**The reason I'm considering seeking professional help is because other symptoms have started to develop at a pretty rapid pace and it's starting to worry me. It's affecting my every day life and hindering what I can do in a day. I thought it might me hormonally triggered, or perhaps its just stresses in general life that's triggered it.**   


**- I've lost all motivation.** Even when I think I want to do something (or need to do something) I don't.   
**- I've been avoiding social stuff**; I'll make plans with friends and then promptly cancel because my anxiety gets real bad.   
**- I bathe much less than I used to.** Not because I don't want to, but because I almost forget or just ""don't feel good enough to go do it"" which kind of sounds like depression but I never had issues with it before with depression.  
**- My general life has become increasingly disorganized** \- it's really bad. Not only do I leave things in a constant mess, but I will start doing something and completely go off track. I'll forget to eat then notice I'm hungry, so I'll start fixing something to eat and notice the dog needs food so I get his food ready and realize shit I'm still holding my cereal as I pour his food in his bowl; then I sit down and set the bowl down and forget to eat it because I noticed I left some project unfinished on the couch and I started working on that. I didn't used to be like this. I've described it as like, what I imagine ADD must be like? And that's what I thought this might be for awhile if it weren't for the following thing::  


**- Most worrisome is my brain has been ""buzzing""** \- I don't know any other way to describe it really. It's like many thoughts and voices all at once. I'll try to focus on one thought and before I can finish it my mind has jumped to another. It doesn't seem to have any specific triggers other than stress but it usually is at its worst at night, which has caused frequent bouts of insomnia over the past 6 months or so. On the rare occasion it happens during my waking hours, the voice(s) (which is similar to my inner voice but not quite the same) is usually telling me I'm worthless or stupid. Or it's like this constant stream of unintelligible whispers.   


**An example of the above affecting me at work**: Sometimes when I am helping a customer, because of my thoughts being jumbled I struggle to get what I want to say out. As soon as I realize it's not coming out quickly or in a way that makes sense, it gets worse and I start to slow down. Like I'll stop what I'm saying and search for my thoughts/words, and that makes it worse because now they're looking at me funny. Like ""and?"" or ""get to the point!"" or at least thats how my brain perceives it. The voice(s) start laying into me then like ""god just say something"" ""whats wrong with you"" etc etc   


Despite thinking I really need to talk to someone about this I'm absolutely terrified to. I don't know if having another mental illness labeling me is what is keeping me from doing it (I guess that'd be like, I feel ashamed to admit I have a problem?) or if it's because I'm afraid to tell my wife and family about it.

hey y'all. i posted to this subreddit long ago, and it was quite helpful if i remember correctly. 

ive been struggling to figure out how to articulate what's been going on with me lately. i can't tell if im going into an episode or if im already there. it's terrifying regardless.

this all started in my english class at college last week, my teacher dissected my paper in front of my class (with my permission) and i was good humored at first i think. however at some point while he read it, i started to hear this laughter all around the room. in my sane mind i know that everyone isn't laughing at me, it's a ridiculous thought. but it was so intense and overwhelming, and just wouldn't stop. i was extremely distraught by the end of the class, and cried for hours after. that was the first real hallucination i had since my last psychotic episode, what, 6 years ago?

ever since, i haven't been quite right. im mostly able to discern between reality and my delusions and hallucinations, but it's getting harder every day. i self harmed for the first time in YEARS. nothing drastic, but I fear what i might do in order to appease these intensifying voices i keep hearing. i know it's not reality but im so terrified. tomorrow im getting a medical withdrawal from school, and then  i have to figure out if i can keep my job there. i feel like im falling to pieces. 

i can't keep relying on my boyfriend to babysit me either. i feel awful for relying on him and being attached to his hip lately, but he's the only one i feel safe around. we took all the sharps out of the house, but he works all day, 8-12 hours, and mist weeks his only day off is sunday. i honestly don't trust myself to be alone for that long, even with the sharps gone i worry what i might do. i just want these voices to stop.

I believed they somehow could read my mind too. I went to the ER bc i was very afraid and they gave me antipsychotics that i didnt take. I had insight btw, i knew that was pretty unlikely to happen and that probably that was just a delusion an obsession or whatever. I knew those thoughts were nonsensical. But somehow i also believed them. Was like 50 i dont believe it 50 i believe it, and that 50 was terrifying. Fast forward those thoughts ramdomly dissapeared (without meds) and i forgot about them during couple of months. But now im having those thoughts again, and again im believing them and not believing them at the same time. And i dont know what to do, i try not to think a lot about them and im waiting them to disappear like the last time. 

the question is is that a delusion? they dont look like obsessive thoughts to me but i have insight so i dont know. should i tell my therapist?",1570425036.0

But the main thing, which comes to my mind when I'm going through my 4th psychosis now, is that we can choose between two teams on this planet.
And it's the angel team vs. the demon team.
Like in World of Warcraft - the good ones and the bad ones.
I've chosen the angel team, which is here to help others on their journey to light. We are here to illuminate, to light up the world with our energy and sixth sense which is (for me) some kind of a intuition. That we see more than the most of population. We see. We feel. We love. We shine.
At least I feel like the 'normal' even when a 'normal' person calls me ""alien"".
We are here to save the world.
Believe in the Universe. Believe in yourself.

I spent nearly 10 months in a psychosis from 2017-2018 and after getting on injectables was okay, dropped them because I hated the side effects, and had another brief psychosis months later when the stress of life got to me.

I am deeply struggling with the fact that what I see is concrete, there are clear pieces of evidence that should raise more pronounced fear or concern from others it seems, I show them to people, they acknowledge them and the oddness, and then go about their day. I fixate and start to spiral out until I can't deal with a blending of delusions and hallucinations mixed with fact to the point I can't stand straight and break down crying in frustration that what other people take for granted - a cohesive and understood layout of the world and reality - is so far removed. I feel like I'm peeking behind the curtain, like I almost have the ""admin"" code for life and then it all breaks apart.

I haven't wanted to accept the diagnosis, but I'm scared that if I don't and adequately medicate up then I'm likely to tailspin into pending homelessness, pushing away the few people I have left that I have any trust in that care for me, slinging wild accusations that feel so right in NY gut but I can't express the connections or reasons for in an appropriate way or with confidence. I feel a shell of the person I once was and I'm scrambling to find purpose and a baseline to go from - does anyone else deal with this kind of mental back and forth?

312,Further Clarification,2,ddtioi,schizophrenia,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/ddtioi/further_clarification/,2,"Hello.

I'm back.

And I have a lot of things to talk about while they're still in the forefront of my mind. Let's get to it.

\[You're going to need to read [https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/dcofxx/explaining/](https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/dcofxx/explaining/) for any clarity on what I'm going to be talking about.\]

&#x200B;

I've read a lot of things since I made this post. Mainly on how people experience Schizophrenia. What it's like. Many of them are vastly, *vastly* similar.

But they don't apply to me.

&#x200B;

What I feel is totally different. I wholeheartedly believe these things happen, don't get me wrong. I believe it almost religiously...

It's just it doesn't match to what other people seem to feel. It's *insane.*

&#x200B;

So, here goes.

&#x200B;

It's like my imagination gets out of control. None of it is really there. I can see straight through it. But my imagination, my mind's eye, it sees it. It's very, very difficult to explain.

You know how when you imagine someone is there, you can see them, but also straight through them as if they're not there? That's what my experiences are like, but on a much larger, much more intense scale. To the point it affects sound, feeling, environment.

It's like it's my imagination going haywire. I can see through it all. I can see reality in front of me. I can discern reality from imagination like nothing, at least, in visuals. Anything I see, I see reality, and then I see what I see.

I see reality. I see the real world. I can discern the real world.

It's like, at the same time that I see terrifying things, beings following others, the whole world shifting and glitching, I see through it, I see reality, the real world's colours and changes, and through the other things.

All at once.

&#x200B;

I can't explain it super well.

So maybe... I can put it in a hypothetical.

An imaginary friend. We've all had one once, right?

&#x200B;

You can 'see' said imaginary friend, especially when you're a kid. But at the same time, you're 100% aware they're not *truly* there. That they're only a figment of your imagination.

The only difference is that I can't control any of it. I can't make it stop. Thinking about it admittedly makes it happen more, but not by any influence of my own...

&#x200B;

Does it make me a fake? Is this just me seeking attention?  
I can't tell.  
I... Wish I knew the answer. Wish I could say I did, but I don't. I really, honestly don't.

I don't fully understand.

Is this even a disorder? Or is this just...

A figment of my own imagination?

Could I stop it? Or do I just not try?

&#x200B;

...

I don't know.

But I know one thing for damn sure.

People with *Schizophrenia* don't feel like this.

And that sucks. A lot. Because that means one thing.

***Th******ere is no existing explanation for what the hell this is.***

And if that's not the most invalidating thing on the planet, that what you have probably isn't even a condition at all, and that it's just you, but you don't even know what to do about it, then I don't know what the hell invalidation is at all.

Does this even make sense?

313,Being treated differently after diagnosis.,10,ddm4vy,schizophrenia,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/ddm4vy/being_treated_differently_after_diagnosis/,3,"I was diagnosed last year. Since diagnosed I've been treated differently. The major problems are coming from doctors. I've had some bad luck with them but now they think I'm a headcase. First off I see a pchycaitrist so that is the only person I want to talk to about my situation. I went to start up with a new doctor at the beginning of the year and she was acting all weird and jumpy and eventually my mom got out of the waiting room and came in to talk with us. Basically the new doctor was being extremely nosey and wanted to know why I was diagnosed with schizophrenia. I didn't feel like we had to go into detail about everything but we did and it was incredibly uncomfortable and awkward. So she sets me up with a specialist (non mental health related). I go and see her and I'm laughing to myself because when I see her I'm thinking you can't be serious... You would have to be there! Anyway I feel kinda uncomfortable so I decide to have my mom come in with me. We start talking and the girl is kinda rude at first and doesn't introduce herself or anything. Then she slights me and makes insinuations about aspergers which I have btw. She then talks up about her ""boyfriend"" and other BS. So I'm sitting there thinking wow why is she being a massive bitch towards me. I showed zero interest in her and she is acting like she is all high and mighty. I tried very hard to keep it professional and get something out of the visit but she just didn't want to listen and kept acting as if my problems are not a problem. So I decided not to go back to my GP doctor until I get the flu or w/e. I still need a specialist so I'm either going to fire her or go back in deal with more bs.

Lastly I've been treated poorly by my own family. My mom's new catch phrase is ""I'm going to tell your psychiatrist."" My mom flips out over little complaints I make and turns it into ""your mentally ill"". My brother also laughs at me all the time because sometimes I say something about my diagnosis. My sister use to be a psych nurse so she always adds her two cents in. 

I'm just tired of being treated like I have some probablem. When the doctors acted all freaked out like I have some file on me (which i probably do) I felt crushed. If this was years ago I probably would of filed a complaint on the specialist for mocking people with disabilities.

Fittingly enough, schizophrenic was a widely hated trait for a while. As someone put it best, ""Its more of a trait for people who like being shit on at every turn (also known as cdda players)"". But it got better.

&nbsp;

The hallucinations are very in-depth and there's a *lot* of code behind them. The game has randomly-generated NPCs that spawn. So, what can happen, is you find some guy, and start talking to him, then suddenly he attacks you, you open fire, and he disappears. 

The game has a system for hearing sounds, and hallucinations can abuse this. Hearing bumps and thumps and glass breaking, then checking and finding no zombies. Being woken up from sleep by things that aren't there.

&nbsp;

Of course, it's not meant to fully represent schizophrenia, just the aspects that most pertain to gameplay.

It was about 2 hours ago. The person who talked was able to talk to me in a calm manner and it's definitely been the best experience I've had with a crisis line contact. 

The reason I texted the line was because I've felt extremely distressed. My paranoia has reached new levels of bad and the universal entity voice has started giving me even more harmful commands. I hate it. I'll try [attempting to] taking a nap watching a video essay on Final Fantasy and then out of nowhere a voice on top of the video just says ""Oh, hi."" That freaked me the fuck out. Needless to say, no sleeping happened after that. Afterwards, I was working out for a bit, as I'm stretching my arms and back I hear a loud sigh in the back of my ear. Other stuff is just background white noise. Like, I was at a family birthday, as the chill and playful children's music played (with Zelda sprinkled in for good measure) and then out of nowhere I just start hearing like faint noisy drones and guitar chords in the background. Asked my wife if she heard anything and all she said was ""I'm sorry, babe. I didn't.""

I just keep getting these. Sporadically. Through out the day. Meanwhile, the universe voice will pester me through out the day. ""Write the book or go hurt yourself. I'm only trying to protect you."" Mind you, I did start said book. I just don't feel like giving this voice the power she wants. I want to retain that last strand of power I have over my life.

Like hearing people talking in other rooms but with phone quality voices.

I even got a call from my general practice with them telling me they were highly worried of me and what I had told them I was going through and should consider full hospitalization. 

How is hospitalization? I've been avoiding getting to the point in which that is option I desperately needed, but I think I've been at the point of needing it for years but just living in constant denial.

Over the past year, as I've experienced a lot of episodes. I have lost a lot of functionality over this time and required significant accommodations to get by. I was talking with my pdoc about this yesterday, and when I asked when it would start to get better, she told me it's gotten better than it was, which it has. But this improvement has started to even out. And she asked me ""what if it never gets entirely better and you're never at 100% again?"" And I've suspected for a while that this might be the case. But being asked that caused it to really hit me like a punch. What if I really am losing functionality, and will have lost it permanently? 

I've been struggling just to keep from losing my job. On good days I can even see friends. But I have as many bad days as good, sometimes more. I know that there are many people on this sub who deal with this and to a greater degree than I have. But I'm really struggling to accept this.

My mother is new to all this and is understandably frazzled. She mentioned that me playing D&D could be adding to this because it's fantasy. The therapist very professionally and logically shut that down. Unfortunately, my mother is very persistent with her ideas. We continued the session as normal, she did surrender. Immediately after my mother resumed trying to convince me, not only that it's adding, but causing my hallucinations because I'm ""opening so many gateways so you're open to attacks \[from demons\]""

I have *TRIED* to tell my mom that the board game is not summoning **fucking demons**, and that, in fact, me, my friends, and everyone else who plays the game is not automatically delusional. People who play D&D do not think the game is real, I assured her. I am just sick.

I'm honestly at my wits end here, I'm the one with the disconnect from reality yet I've got to be the voice of reason, and apparently an ineffectual one. She's also convinced that I don't need anti-psychotics and should instead try natural remedies like chiropracty for *psychosis*.

I wouldn't bother, and just stop talking to her until she cools off, but I'm a minor and her treatment is in her fucking hands, and I'd rather be able to function than losing my mind while encouraging my mother's unreasonable distrust of proven medical science in favor of cobbled, unverified science.",1570186260.0

356,I just started a new med and I think this is what I've needed all along. (I promise I'm not a pharma represantative),10,dcveci,schizophrenia,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/dcveci/i_just_started_a_new_med_and_i_think_this_is_what/,4,"It's a partial D3 agonist, acting as a mood stabilizer and anti-psychotic that instead of just reducing dopamine mediates it in the brain, so if there is too low dopamine it will increase it, if there is too high dopamine it will decrease it. It's called Vraylar.

I have been having serious difficulties with psychosis since starting college, and I just met with a new psychiatrist here. She worked through her lunch break to talk to me for 2 whole hours. She was very energetic and charismatic. She just totally ""gets it"" and I find that in wanting in a lot of psychiatrists. After talking with me, she said she is going to lower the dose of risperidone and add Vraylar which is pro-cogntive and helps with negative symptoms. I have noticed both of these effects very strong.

I just feel focused, motivated, calm, peaceful, happy. It completely quells my cravings for stimulants. The only thing that is neutral about it, not good, is that it makes me feel kind of strange or ""wonky."" But it doesn't seem like most anti-psychotics where it just totally kills your creativity and intelligence. I feel like I have perhaps an enhanced creativity right now. It's as if it still allows me to access the highly spiritual, peak, creative energy of the states of psychosis, that are a fundamental part of who I am and what makes life worth living, without the psychosis itself.

Idk, I was VERY skeptical about adding another anti-psychotic, but her goal is to get me off the risperidone eventually which was my goal as well, and I don't want to jinx it, but this may be actually just what I need.

Wish me luck for the long-term.",1570158102.0

&#x200B;

Lately I started dating someone new, and as you all probably know, choosing when and who to tell about your disorder is a very tricky game to play. You wait too long, you run the risk of them not being ok with it and leaving or using it against you in a lot of ways (been there, done that). You tell them too quickly, its a real bonding moment and it shouldnt be shared with everyone. You have to gauge them, their beliefs, the relationship, everything really. A big thing for me is also I feel like the things I have told people before I tell them I am schizophrenic are immediatly put into question. 

&#x200B;

I have had a lot of unique experiences, Ive traveled to 3rd world countries for research, almost been arrested, seen massacre photos/videos, Ive seen people get killed, Ive lived in abject poverty, etc. But I feel like when I say ""Hey I got schizophrenia"" it makes people question whether or not the things Ive seen or done actually happened. Does anyone else feel like the moment they say ""hey I have \_\_\_\_\_"" the people they tell automatically doubt everything they've ever said. I know that growing up when I thought of things like schizophrenia I imagined the sterotypical ""killer, lunatic, crazy guy down the street with the tin foil hat who drinks his own pee"" type of person.

376,Explaining,2,dcofxx,schizophrenia,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/dcofxx/explaining/,4,"I've never really explained what my experiences are like. I feel like I should go in depth and see if other people are like me, perhaps. I know it's unlikely.

I've been directed to Schizophrenia because every search I've ever made suggests me the disorder, some scholarly article. I dunno if I fit the bill, though, at least fully.

Let's divide into categories: Visual, auditory, feeling, tasting, smelling, mental.


**Visual**
I see things others don't. I call them entities. They're tall beings usually around eight feet or taller, usually double the height of the person they're associated with.

They follow everyone, and have terrifying grins. I can't always see them, though. Only sometimes, though, I always feel their eyes, their presense. They watch, observe, and stare. It's terrifying to see them.

Along with this, I see something I call the other world. I'm convinced it's real. The other world creates attributes for people. Wings, eyes, horns: you name it. There's a person with it. It's always dark, always spooky. Eyes are always following and hunting you in the other world.

It often comes in flashes, with wind blowing in my eyes. I see the other side, the one that others don't. In the other world I have wings and ears, and everything has a sort of mythical attribute. Sometimes it leaks into the real world. I feel like this is where the entities come from.

It really sounds like something from Stranger Things, if you need something to compare it to. Like the world Will was in, but, without the toxic crap and the weird stuff everywhere. Just dark and desolate, nothing really dead though.

**Auditory**
I hear things. So many things. From whips cracking to screams, to doors shutting and distant chatter that I can *almost* make out, but not quite.

I can hear distant conversations from people, often at night when no one else is awake. Like people are here, after me, going to come for me.

I also heard glass shatter and other odd clicking sounds.

**Feeling**
I feel touches all over me, like people's hands, and get random shivers because I feel something on me. I look down and nothing is there though.

I also often feel bugs crawling on me. Bugs, spiders, ants; all sorts of things.

**Tasting**
This should be pretty self explanatory. Most of the time it's random nostalgic ones, things I haven't eaten in 47258826294 years or, oddly enough, iron.

**Smelling**
What I smell is super hard to describe. They're very vivid and unnatural that I can't compare them to anything, honestly.

**Mental**
This is the one I've been waiting to get to.

Everyone is out to get me, I swear it. I feel like any time I see a man, or a woman, or even a kid, it's like they're plotting my death, or don't like me. I'm paranoid.

Like, any time I see a group of men, I feel like they're automatically out to get me, or my family.

I feel watched by people constantly, their opinions burning into my skull. I feel everyone is out to get me, like someone will randomly recognize me and jump me in the middle of the store.

As well as this, I feel like I often have trouble controlling my actions.
Sometimes I get bouts of violent feelings.

I have this dog I love, her name is Star. But when I was alone with her in the car once, with the window slightly cracked, I wanted to take her little body, shove it through forcefully, just to let her drop to the ground below.

I wanted to h u r t her. Something I'd never wanted to do before. And I've felt this way for everyone at least once. My own dogs, my family, cousins, friends...

It's scary to experience.




Yeah, that's all I have to say. Anyone else feel these sorts of things...?",1570123430.0

I've been dissociating again and my reading comprehension abilities have noticeably declined. I've had my Seroquel upped from 25 mg to 125 mg over the course of a month. The other night I heard someone audibly scream in my ear while I was laying in bed, well awake. I keep seeing people approaching me, and this morning I started having paranoid thoughts.. even though I didn't believe them.

I don't want to become a shell of a human being again. I don't want to fight my own brain. I have a boyfriend now, and he makes me so happy. I don't want to lose myself and not be able to be with him. I started college, I don't want to have to drop out. I don't want to be a failure. I'm starting to have a hard time coping with having to go to college and I hate it because I know I'm academically capable. 

I just want to stay myself for once.",1570049263.0

Edit: yes, I know doctors & medication are better than this, we have been fighting those battles for years.

397,What does disordered thinking feel like for you,6,dcc4sj,schizophrenia,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/dcc4sj/what_does_disordered_thinking_feel_like_for_you/,5,"I'm going to see a psychiatrist soon about a range of experiences (I'll spare you my history and leave the diagnosing to the professionals), but I really want to know what disordered thinking feels like because I'm trying to understand my own experiences. I have times where I just really struggle to organise and understand my thoughts and I can't find much about what that looks like for other people.

I've seen the diagnostic details around what disordered thinking is but it's mostly focused on speech (because a psychiatrist can't see inside your mind) and for me when it hits I really struggle to get out any words at all. 

I have racing thoughts sometimes, which I've seen others talk about, but basically I have times where my mind just kind of gets overwhelmed. I'll find myself just staring at one spot and struggling to make sense of what my thoughts actually are. it's almost like I get flashes of things like faces or concepts or things to think about but they aren't fully formed and they all just blend together, it's almost like having a trippy dream. I feel like I cant hear properly when this happens and I'm kind of unable to do anything except wait for it to pass. Sometimes I'll get very frustrated too because I try and communicate with my wife and I just can't find any words. 

Earlier this year it got very bad, and has been sporadically bad since, but I felt like my mind was empty a lot of the time and I was experiencing what I now know to be thought blocking. It was really scary because it just felt like I had a complete cognitive decline and couldn't really focus on anything or keep anything in my memory for a good few weeks.

I've also had some experiences before where written words have stopped making sense to me, they just seem like letters, and while I've had a very small amount of experience with things like hallucinations and delusions, it seems like my thinking is my weak spot and what tends to go when my mental health gets poor.  

Is this relatable at all? I guess i'm just trying to make sense of this particular symptom. It's something I struggle to even explain as it feels so strange when its happening (how do you explain what you can't even think).",1570060482.0

The link to imgur shows the results that I had gotten back and they show what a mess my body was. I know these tests are available in the United States and in Canada. If you’re Canadian like me, then try your best to go through the medical system to get one of these tests done. Otherwise, any naturopathic doctor that you can find will set you up with one of these (obviously you will have to pay for the meeting with the naturopath and for the test which could be around $250 CAD). It’s a urine test that is sent to The Great Plains laboratory in Alberta. I don’t know about the States but I do know it’s available over there. This test showed me which vitamins I was deficient in which is *crucial* for knowing what supplements I needed to take. Schizophrenia is an overall unhappy and unhealthy body. Symptoms of schizophrenia are vast and they vary. They are all linked to one or more or a combination of vitamin deficiencies.  Deficiency in the vitamin B series is typical for people experiencing delusions or hallucinations. Now that I know vitamin B6 was my deficiency and also vitamin C, I now can take those vitamins in concentrated form and I’m thinking sooo much better. People that are suffering, or people that know other people who are suffering, if you have the time and the care to get one of these tests done for someone in need of care, this is the best way to get started on an eventual full recovery!

401,What am I to do?,3,dccsa1,schizophrenia,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/dccsa1/what_am_i_to_do/,12,"24(GF) with schizoaffective disorder. I'm trying to keep this short. Depression came early, officially though in 7th grade. My parents never believed in mental illness. I felt unheard all my life. Fighting so hard to live. I broke. I went so long untreated. When eventually my high school told them to at least get a therapist (and the also put me in a special needs program), the therapist told them I need medication. They refused. And I fell deeper and deeper into an abyss. I was explosive to them and was bounced back and forth between living with my mom (who couldn't deal with me) to my dad who lived in the ghetto. Gunshots, mold, crack heads, abusers that lived above us, roaches, rats, etc. I slept on the couch because it was a one bedroom and my grandmother also lived there. 

By senior year I was done. Had my first big psychotic break. I skipped classes or slept in them or just spaced out. After school i was shoe horned into taking care of multiple grandparents with various levels of disabilities. My great grandma, great great aunt, my great grandpa, my uncles mother and now my dad's mother. They all passed one by one and I was moved to the next. My psychosis grew, my depression grew, anxiety, panic disorder, bpd,etc. 

I'm to a point where my brain has shriveled cognitively. Cant read and sometimes cant even watch tv. Cant handle stress or sudden changes of plans, etc. very well. Can't write as well. Can't focus. Slow reaction speed. Short AND long term memory loss. I'm on medication now but they aren't helping as much. Feeling suicidal again. 

All this time my parents never took initiative to learn about my mental illness so this causes many problems amongst us. I've never had a job due to illness and taking care of grandparents, but I don't think I can (not a normal one) but I'm also not sick enough for disability plus the no job thing. Learning new things is hard now and I can't drive because of mental problems (If I'm not feeling anxious to the point of panic attacks or feeling suicidal then I'm spacing out to the point of not even seeing a car in front of me which almost got me killed because by the time I came to I couldn't even react fast enough. Thank the stars that my dad was there.)

So I'm stuck living with my parents and being home all day taking care of my grandma. No money for myself. Causing rifts between family. Struggling with my health and therefore struggling with taking proper care of my grandma. Which shes more priority than myself. But to my parents my health isn't a priority. Therapy appointments go missed. Never help with keeping my meds on track (because I forget). Never help with making calls (I do it myself but I put it off because I know I'd have to work around their schedule anyway which everything else comes first most of the time).

I want to move out and back to the city at least thered be uber and stuff. I want to maybe take art classes because I see myself being a writer and an artist but I find it hard to learn anymore. I want consistency in my health care(physical and mental). I want my own life. I want to be able to buy deodorant and not have to wait for them. Or soap, or toothpaste. Or new clothes because the ones I have are ripped or don't fit. I want to eat how I want. But how? How? What do I do? I'm stuck. I'm drowning.

Please help. And if you have further questions I can try and answer. I skimmed over a lot of stuff or simplified them.",1570063309.0

436,both my partner and i think he is schizophrenic and i need advice,14,dbuwip,schizophrenia,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/dbuwip/both_my_partner_and_i_think_he_is_schizophrenic/,7,"Like the title says, both of us believe he is paranoid schizophrenic. He’s semi-functional but refuses treatment or diagnosis. We are living together (have been for 2 years) and have been together for 4 years. 
He is okay sometimes but most of the time he is pretty convinced that other people are going to kill or hurt him, the government is out to get him, or the police are following him. He wants to keep the blinds shut all the time and hates leaving the apartment to go anywhere. 
It used to not be as bad but it is progressively getting worse and I am having a hard time. I want to get advice about how I can help him with life. Like I said above, he refuses to get treatment, so I’m trying to help him function semi-normally in life and slowly encourage him to get treatment eventually. He struggles with most of the complex tasks in life and self-medicates as a result. I think he would benefit from actual medication, but I am no doctor, and I just want things to get better. 
So from fellow schizophrenics, what would you want me to do in this situation? How can I be a better partner to him?",1569972052.0

441,Need advice dealing with schizophrenic partner,4,dbyqku,schizophrenia,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/dbyqku/need_advice_dealing_with_schizophrenic_partner/,2,"Hello everyone. Throwaway for obvious reasons.

I have a partner with a schizophrenic history, diagnosis and medical treatment. As far as I can tell, there have been voices and the feeling of a presence that has implanted a device inside her head and that wants to kill her, if she doesn't do as commanded - which is also what holds her back from talking too much about it, when she's in a state of acute psychosis.

We have been together for almost three months now and so far, it seemed like with the meds and therapy, she has it under control. This evening though (it's night now and she's sleeping), she started asking weird questions like ""How will he find us tomorrow?"". They are weird because neither does anyone of us have an appointment with a man tomorrow, neither could she tell me, who she was talking about or what that person wanted. At one point she told me, that she felt weird for asking me about him, but she didn't seem to doubt that there was someone, even if she could not at all explain to me, who that person was. It doesn't seem ""really bad"" or anything yet, but it's irritating to me at least.

My partner has prepared me for acute phases of psychosis only by saying that I will ""know it when I see it"" and that I should just bring her to a hospital if it gets too bad. I guess I'm most nervous about not being able to judge, when that time has come. Especially since she starts feeling weird talking about ""that man"" already, I'm afraid that she'll just hold back sharing with me, what's going on or what she feels is going on. I'm trying to be supportive. Of course I tried to gain more details by asking about who that man is or what he wants, but got no answers (again - not sure if she had none or if she doesn't want to share them).

Can you please give me some non-medical advice about how to cope with this, according to your experiences? How can I figure out when I need to intervene? When should I just be there and provide comfort and an open ear? At the moment, I just hope that after sleeping for the night, tomorrow it'll be back to normal. But how can I be sure? I appreciate all of your thoughts and related experiences that can help me deal with this in a appropriate way. Thank you!",1569988257.0

Then there’s these goddamn grandiose delusions about the future, which I think might be keeping me alive, but almost definitely aren’t real and are really distressing. I don’t know if I want them gone so i can move on or if I need them. It’s like a catch-22.

Some of them had family members that killed themselves and they just seemed devastated but in this quiet sort of way. I pictured my friends and family being like that and thought I can’t do this.

But then a second ago, I was thinking about everything and had the thought that I can just go fucking kill myself again. It would be so easy and it would take less than an hour total to set up.

is there any hope of it getting better? because life fucking sucks right now

These dreams can last years, decades, centuries. Who knows. During this dream they learn the power of language and the power of energy. They wake up almost super human and with a goal: to help enlighten the rest of the world. They speak in code and can feel our energies perfectly. They have a godlike conciousness. They understand the plan and pattern of the universe and are one with it. They are in such a higher dimension of conciousness than us that we cant even comprehend. Us schizophrenics are surrounded by these beings and they talk in code connected to our thoughts as a way to try to help us understand. Or simply guide our thoughts. This is why 2 people sitting next to you talking about nonsense can seemingly be directing what they are saying at you. They have infinite power with language. They also keep it a perfect secret. They have these dreams every night and are trillions? Quadrillions? Eternities old? Who knows. They might meet each other in secret during the dreams and discuss the next day on earth. Maybe the dreams can be shared. I went to the hospital with this theory thinking they were going to give me the red pill and turn me into one of them. That didnt happen.

476,Diagnosed with schizophrenia but think I have health anxiety?,2,dbn0jo,schizophrenia,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/dbn0jo/diagnosed_with_schizophrenia_but_think_i_have/,1,"I was diagnosed with schizophrenia earlier this year while hospitalized.

I didn't develop a good relationship with the doctors that diagnosed me and stopped taking the Haloperidol they gave me.

I believe I have health anxiety and my current psychiatrist kind of sort of agrees with me. This second relationship is also very poor. I'm uncomfortable with it and wish I could see someone else but the trauma of all these awful past experiences makes it hard to motivate myself to make the change.

**I believe I have suffered from health anxiety since I was at least 19. That year I thought I had skin cancer (I'm olive to brown skinned and no one in my family has ever had this type of cancer). I wasn't able to sleep for days thinking about it and even feel like I experienced mild hallucinations, that I got bigger, inflated like a balloon in the middle of a sleepless night. I think I even was experiencing panic attacks then, but it's been hard to get a doctor to help me figure out if I did or didn't. Like I said I don't feel listened to in my relationship with my psychiatrist.**

**A funny thing that happens to me when my anxiety gets really bad is that I switch from one disease to another within days or hours and don't realize how unreasonable I'm being. I'll worry I have skin cancer one day, the next it's Lyme disease, the next leukemia. Or sometimes the degree of severity changes, one day I'll forecast one round of chemotherapy (don't know how any of this actually works), the next I'm convinced that it's terminal. Does anyone here experience the same?**

**I usually read tons of info on it online, see a doctor once because I live in a rural area (if I didn't I might have fallen into the habit of multiple visits with different doctors), find and stalk real people who have the disease online, join groups about it, read books, sometimes even prescribe myself ""fixes"", like juicing or dieting, exercise, etc.**

**Another really important aspect is that I seem to develop a lot of rituals or** [compulsions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3LaY8pjD4E) **that help me calm down. Excercise, eating habits, cleanliness related. The more I do them and time passes, because they calm me down, I start to think it's the ""illness"" that's getting better.**

**Since that year I was 19, it really hasn't gone away, it just morphs into a preoccupation with a different illness.**

By the way everything bolded, which I think is extremely relevant, is stuff I didn't get to tell the unethical megalomaniacs that diagnosed me with schizophrenia. I mentioned the word hypochondria once and was kicked out of the room. Subsequently, I only talked to them about the weather and the food there. They cited they were still able to give me a serious diagnosis taking into account their ""observations"" of me, as if nothing I said mattered and I don't have the ability to have insight into myself and help them, cooperate to find my real diagnosis. I feel as if I was treated like an animal and think their diagnosis is complete trash.

These doctors told me that once medicated, I'd be safe and sound back with my family who they didn't believe was abusive (I have many horror stories in my history and there are so many others who experienced the same nightmare scenarios in the subreddits I frequent), they said I was just paranoid. I definitely experienced abuse, but the person who got to have the final say over things was an abusive aunt who happens to be a nurse that worked for the same government organization I was hospitalized in.",1569927567.0

I’m delusional, I suffer from OCD intrusive thoughts (like pedophilia, homosexuality, being transgender) I’m depressed, most likely have anxiety (like social anxiety) and I’m very paranoid around people. I’m paranoid because I feel like whenever I think something about anyone they can know somehow. If the person I’m thinking about is upstairs taking a shower and I’m downstairs. I get anxiety because I feel like they might know I thought about them. I daydream a lot in my bed and listen to music and fantasize about an idealistic version of myself. Good looking, good personality, hot, good with girls, girls like me. I thought this was maladaptive daydreaming because I do it everyday and it’s going to be very hard to stop. I just love doing it. I also move around in my bed when I fantasize too. If I do a fast movement in the fantasy then I’ll probably move on the bed or something. If I start crying in the fantasy, than I’ll try acting out the same in my bed. If you saw me in my bed you’d probably see a chubby kid in his bed getting emotional. I think I might experience delusions of grandeur because when I’m around people in RL I feel more unique or different than them. I feel nicer and kinder than them. I know it’s all bullshit I’m just your average everyday citizen. But those feelings I get around people are hard to shake off. I just can’t not feel grand about myself.

I've also been experiencing hallucinations in my periphery, sometimes limbs, shadows, but mostly cats for some strange reason.

Just turned 17, I have ocd and i had some serious suicidal ideation for a month recently.
Now sometimes i don't trust things i hear or see until i confirm they are real. Like, seeing my mom laying in the sofa in my peripheral vision. I have to look directly at her till i see it's really her. Guess that's a natural reaction lol.

He still hasn’t really accepted his diagnosis and at first refused his medication but he’s gotten pretty good about taking it and hasn’t had any psychosis or delusions in a few months - or so we all thought (meaning myself and his treatment team). He started putting weight back on, the flat effect has dissipated, he’s showering and even applied for a job of his own free will. I usually go to appointments with him but couldn’t today because I have patients of my own to treat today and his psychiatrist just called me to tell me he was refusing to attend his physical (he and I had already discussed cancelling it due to the fact that the doctor his psychiatrist scheduled it with is not covered via his insurance and we can’t afford that) but he told her that while he was refusing for financial reasons he was also “locked up and institutionalized for several years in 2016” (which doesn’t make sense given it’s 2019...and he’s only been hospitalized once and it was in June...) and that “he’s a multimillionaire and the government is withholding his money and has deemed him unfit for society” and lots of other things along those lines. These are things extremely reminiscent of his delusions when he was not on medication i.e. being a millionaire whose assists were stolen by the government because he’s former cia like Jason Bourne and they took out a hit on him.

She’s upping his medication again - which she informed him of and he said he’s fine with, as am I. But she’s concerned he’s slipping back into psychosis and has been hiding it from us. I’ve worked with other patients in psychosis, and been with my fiancé since high school and they/he’s never been able to “control” it. It’s always been like word vomit. 

Can anyone out there control their symptoms or hide it? I’ve changed my hours since his hospitalization so I can be home more often with him since I was working psych ward shifts and 18 hour days some days now I’m home most of the time to help care for him so it’s not like I’m missing anything and he sleeps most of the day. He really hasn’t been symptomatic. I don’t know where that came from today and now I’m concerned and having a borderline anxiety attack at the office. And of course he’s not answering his phone. I also think he skipped his dose of zyprexa last night - I asked him about it this morning and he tried to convince me he took it - but we were both kind of up all night and I didn’t see him ever take it, so could he just be deteriorating that fast? The last time I’m 100% positive he skipped a dose was back in July and he was texting me that God visited him and told him that he was the immortal chosen one so it seems likely. 


Also if anyone has any experience on injection antipsychotics I’d appreciate the info! We’re trying to get him switched to a different insurance carrier and then switched to an injection but there’s no zyprexa injection so we’re nervous he’ll resist. So any advice is appreciated.",1569895261.0

I was just settling into my regimen when I had to take almost a week to refill both my antidepressant and antipsychotic prescriptions. At first it was not so bad, the AP has a long half-life, but after a few days I was getting noticeably worse. I woke up one morning convinced my family was spying on me. Everywhere I looked someone was watching. At the store every employee would turn their heads as I went by. At school the next day I was being followed by people who happened to be walking the same way for a long time and as I listened to them talk I tried to decipher what they were saying, thinking it related to me somehow. I'm not sure if it was related but dissociation was way more intense too, I tried playing solitaire on my computer and genuinely thought I was playing someone else's game, as if I was some interloper who took it over, or possibly the program itself executing their decisions. There were some other things, but this was the most prominent.

&#x200B;

Of course by now I've realized none of that is true, and the pharmacy finally had my meds in stock, but are there any tricks to having to withdraw suddenly from meds? Mine have a coating on them so I probably shouldn't split them or I would have. I'm also worried that no matter what I'll be worse if I come off meds for the rest of my life, but perhaps that is another issue. I know the first rule of stopping psych meds cold turkey is to not to, but sometimes it can't be helped.",1569850153.0

I guess I’m not really asking for advice, I just really want to know what having friends or romances are like for schizophrenics? Is it hard to keep people around? Are arguments triggering? Can you be yourself around the people you’re close to? Or just any general information, google doesn’t really help in that department.

It’s been a slippery slope for a few years, but these past few months have been especially rough. My grandmother was diagnosed with schizophrenia, so it is genetic. I have memories of my grandma screaming and yelling “no, stop” and being tormented by the voices in her head. She used to think I wasn’t real, and that I was just an imposter. I don’t really have a single memory of her being cognitively aware. So I am terrified and worried sick for my sister.  They have put her on Risperdal. I called her a little awhile ago and she sounded generally defeated and almost in a zombie like state. I have not been able to go 10 minutes without worrying about her and getting tearful.

514,How to prove people that I cannot work? How to make them understand me?,13,day1e6,schizophrenia,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/day1e6/how_to_prove_people_that_i_cannot_work_how_to/,11,"Hello, I am living with schizophrenia for 15 years now. Since I was diagnosed I have been hospitalised over 10 times with numerous relapses and my mental health is following generally slow gradual decline with some shorter recovery periods. What is certain is I can do less and less. Hence I decided to seek someone to care for me as my mother can't do it anymore due to her own health issues and age. Rest of family is also unable, because of work or other factors. My only two options were to be taken care of by state or someone much more closer than entity such as institutions. Hence I luckily found my girlfriend/caretaker with whom I'll marry next year. It was a real struggle as women (especially in my westernised country) would find it as serious impediment to ""freedom"". Luckily world is huge, I have access to internet, so I found the right one. Of course, it's not only caretaker benefit I see in her, but also emotional and love component (as people with my diagnosis know - emotions suffer incredibly in such illness and most of us get totally blunt, which is basically case with me).

But now, coming to the grim part of this illness. I'd say even worse than symptoms itself. It's peoples (mis)understanding of the suffering I live with. I am on welfare, of course, and the health committee experts ruled my capability to work as ""completely lost"". It happened since I got into health issues and it was really tedious trial. Since age of 15 I am ruled unfit for work"". Even though in years after I was wondering if that decision is right, few years ago I really made peace with it and understood that they really were right after all. But, as I guess many of people like me know, this actually makes things really nasty. First of, there are no visible issues with me on surface when someone meets me. I see, hear, I am physically okay. I can talk quite okay and I do posses lots of knowledge about many things (which is product of me filing all this years with reading stuff on internet). Hence, everyone would and does conclude that I am actually fit for work and that there is NOTHING WRONG with me. That is simply killing me to the core. I know that the intention is to motivate person like me with such action, but it produces horrible loop of perpetuating mental distress. I know I can barely take a shower or eat when I am sometimes alone at home, yet everyone concludes I am ""so smart/can do anything"". This two things clash in my mind and make horrible pain in my life. The thing is no one of these claimants ever talk to me more than an hour. I am always consciously fighting my psychotic tendencies while in public. To show someone that I am really ill, I'd have to stop fighting my psychotic thoughts and let loose. Where would that lead? In best case I'd start yelling and acting very weird which would lead to immediate call of police/ambulance and forceful/harsh treatment. In worst case I'd physically attack that person and maybe even kill such person which we all know where would lead. Other options I do not have. Yet, people are constantly provocating me that I am capable of anything, that it's ""all just in my head""... It's driving me insane. Even my brother repeats over and over again that he could arrange some job in company he works in if I want to. Even after I explain my issues, he repeats it on first occasion he can. My father is also certain that I am just lazy and need some ""push"". It really makes me miserable. Once I was also energetic about some part time job my neighbour wanted to arrange me and told the story to my psychiatrist upon which she replied very earnestly: ""It would be miracle if you could work an hour per day"" She is an expert and leads my case from the very beginnings so I do trust her with a lot of things. My welfare ain't some richness, especially considering my country is generally quite weak economically, yet it fills my basic needs and I also have rights to inherit both parents pensions which will turn out to be cosy amount of income. Especially considering I have very narrow interests and live very frugally. Travelling I don't like, nor I liked before getting ill. It's huge chore for me and I abhor it. I don't drive care (and wouldn't) and actually prefer using public transport (also since childhood). I don't watch TV, I use budget phones (as they serve all my needs), etc. So generally you can see now why money isn't issue to me even if it's very small amount. What is issue to me and finally a question I want to ask this community is that people think my life is miserable and assume I need better one. Just because I don't enjoy going out to city and am more or less indoors person and take a walk in solitude of woods, people assume I am suffering in my life. Even many healthy people prefer same lifestyle as I do. Yet, I can't prove people that I am okay with this life and that I CAN'T WORK! It's also worth to mention that when I fix something on some persons PC (as I am very proficient in it's use) they automatically reply with: ""You see you can do it? You see you can work."" Judging on one easy problem I solve in less than 10 minutes and which happens once in a year or less! Same goes for everything. If I fix some electricity problem they instantly assume I can be electrician. People outside who someone get talkative with me (which I abhor) realise that ""nothing is wrong with me"". Just last week, this solemnising official who I inquired at about my marriage process assumed that. ON BASIS OF ONE 30 MINUTE TALK! That really really harms my psyche as I explained. I swear to all of you and God: If I could work, I definitely would! But work ain't fixing easy PC issue once in a blue moon or talking to random people 30 minutes a day. It is something much much MUCH more demanding. Not a single job in human existence would be easier than talking random stuff with people 30 minutes a day, yet this whole last week I ran around asking officials and court interpreters some info (around 4 hours of moving around city and visiting my mother in hospital) until friday exhausted me so much that I had to rest whole this weekend just to regain energy. On friday I became extremely aggressive as I was running out of any energy and nearly started throwing stuff around house. And what I did? Just wake up earlier for 4 days and went around city asking some info on my process and buying new headphones from shop. That can't even compare to easiest of easy jobs in existence yet I was nearing psychotic episode.

So for love of the God, how can I show people that I can barely pick myself up to do anything? How can I make them understand at least one small part at the time? I know schizophrenia comes in many forms and quite few people recover to point of being fully functional and working. Sadly it's not true for me. So I seek any advice regarding this issue from people who suffer same issues or their cares. I would really appreciate any advice you can give me as I am really spiralling into worse and worse mental health.",1569806052.0

I've read the rules, and know that since this is my first post on this account, I will be held to a higher standard than others. I can understand why.

&#x200B;

I'm mainly going to be ghosting, but figured a short introduction was necessary.

I'm not a diagnosed Schizo, but I'm pretty sure something along that is on the horizon from how people respond to me talking about what I see and how I think.

I have a psychiatrist and a therapist, so I won't be asking medical questions.

&#x200B;

I see, hear, feel, taste and smell all sorts of things that don't exist, and I'm a suspected Bipolar. Again, nothing is diagnosed. I do have a diagnosis for SAD, though, formerly MDD. Due to my antidepressants not working I'm suspected to be on something bigger, and have family history and predisposition for possible Bipolar since it's...

Really fricking inheritable.

&#x200B;

I'm not going to really talk about anything else, and I hope this post is as friendly to the rules as possible.

Other than this, I may not even comment. Thanks for reading this far, and if this post is in any way non-conforming to the rules or FAQ \[of which I have not read the latter\], I won't give any issues if this is taken down.

Thanks for your patience. <3

I'm realizing the only reason I want to go to school is because I want to go back to a time when there were people to talk to on a daily basis. I was playing music and getting better at my instrument, there was so much to learn, people to meet, food to eat, lunch to go to, school pride, marching band to march in. Now I'm a caregiver, my parents don't really want to talk to me, my psychiatrist abandoned me, I have no therapist, no trust for Dr.s people think I'm stupid and autistic so they avoid me. I don't know how to really advocate for myself at work or anywhere else, so i just take whats given to me.

and when I think back on it, when I was in school it was exactly the same. My favorite teacher who I thought was my best friend was the only one who continued on purpose for 4 years sneaking up on me to scare me. people thought I was stupid and autistic, and I couldn't advocate for myself.

sometimes I wonder what's the point in trying. I've asked for help and been told to just try harder just do better have you tried relaxing. I said I'm suicidal and was told that if I was actually suicidal I wouldn't be asking for help I would just do it. my family is tired of dealing with my issues they just want me to be an adult and suck it up. I wanted to be a music teacher. I'm a burden on everyone I know. I would try to kill myself but I'm not very good at it obviously and it would just upset everyone they wouldn't understand they would be mad at me it would be expensive and I wouldn't even get any help. Maybe if I go back to school my life will come back I won't be spied on constantly my family would be proud of me my teacher would be my friend again i could eat food and play music and sing. the government wont hate me or want me dead there wont be dead bodies in the walls.

Was your diagnosis a surprise?",8,dafhoi,schizophrenia,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/dafhoi/not_diagnosed_but_tested_high_for_schizo_and_it/,4,"Tldr: big questions in title. The post is all my experiences and how I just think they are normal, but I’m not sure.

(M 22) So I had a psychological evaluation done by a psychotherapist and part of that included an MMPI which is a 500+ question test that tests for a lot of things. The doctor sat me down and showed me the graph of the results which had an enormous spike in the middle and said that was usually results for people with schizophrenia and it was way past of line of medical concern. I’m in shock, but then he goes “but I don’t think you have schizophrenia” ...haha ok but that is really weird though. He did mention 50% of people with that score could just be depressed and anxious. At least that’s what I think he said because in my head I’m still going holy shit holy shit over mt everest’s peak in the middle of that graph. I also didn’t test for psychosis during the inkblot test. Now this is where I have to really think about myself afterwards and if I have been totally truthful to the professionals because some of this was just normal to me.

In the front of my mind I of course don’t think I have had an hallucinations. However, I have had a number of sleep paralysis episodes in my years. Usually the shadowy figure that presses on my chest and I can’t breathe or move. Or I’ve been pecked by someone while laying on my side asleep. And now I think about other times than that because I guess that isn’t the same as schizo hallucinations. Now that I think about it, I remember waking up one morning a couple years ago and swearing I saw some girl standing next to my bed and I instantly went back under the covers before really seeing her. Now I don’t know if It was from being half asleep or what, but I only kind of saw it for a millisecond. I also chocked it up to reading about hypnogogic hallucinations just days prior. Another time I remember waking up and swearing there were tarantulas all over me on the blanket and i curled in a tight ball underneath the covers until I came to and realized they were gone and not real. NOW, after thinking about it a lot, I feel like I see blurs if small movement or shadows in my peripherals. It makes me very paranoid.

Of course I am very depressed right now and also very anxious. More so anxious and I think it forms the depression. I get horrible depressive/anxiety/paranoid/existential attacks at night sometimes. I cry and shake and then I feel like I’m going crazy and don’t want to live and just see a different life or start over. Or I want out of the matrix or something. I need to get out from life or what life is or something. Tonight I felt like something was going to come to fruition on front of me and scare the hell out of me and I don’t know if I’m just making it up. I have been a very paranoid person though and was especially as a kid when home alone. Always thinking something was just right around the corner hiding. Tonight I went to the mirror and I just stared at myself and I kept fearing I wasn’t going to recognize myself and then I looked at both of my eyes and started to freak out because they didn’t move when I switched eyes and I thought that wasn’t normal. Then I kept moving back and forth away from the mirror and freaked myself out a little as my face got really close. A couple years prior I got really depressed and couldn’t recognize myself in the mirror and wanted the world to end and literally felt like I was getting possessed and WANTED the devil inside of me and was almost embracing it.

I leave my window open at night which is on the first floor facing the street and I am constantly paranoid and looking out of it fearing someone is outside wanting to come through my window. Any leaf or branch sounds put me on edge. I also thought lightning was going to strike me through my window and slammed it shut when i was half asleep because I heard thunder.

As for delusions, I’ve never thought I had any, although I do aspire to be a great performer and I literally think to myself “When I’m famous” its never “if” just when and how I will get there. Sometimes I feel a little narcissistic and that I’m the main character. Or that I’m secretly in a movie. But i don’t think I really believe that. I think I think that when I’m struggling. And sometimes I do feel like life is a simulation and I try and “squeeze” myself out of it at times with all my effort to no avail. 

And I do feel I am slipping with interacting with new people. I honestly just rather avoid it altogether. Can never work a service job ever again. 

I also feel like words are my worst enemy when speaking. I’m always forgetting certain words and my speech gets very jumbled at times. I also talk very fast some times but like not in a good way at all. And I also have forgotten people’s names that I have known for a while. 

I see my regular psychiatrist again in a few days and idk what is the next step. I feel like I need to talk to the psychotherapist again. Idk if my mind is just making shit up or what. That graph scared the hell out of me though.",1569703360.0

I've been Bipolar going on 18 years now, and nothing like this has ever happened to me.  I had to get off a few meds and the withdrawals were horrible and needless to say I went a little astray... and started coming up with things like B12 was causing me to act strangely and the TV caused me pain, the sun was going to cause my meds to give me anaphylaxis etc... All I guess could be based in some reality but then I was yanked off klonopin and a few of them got worse.  I'm writing finally on a computer, after being given Geodon (after Rexulti after Abilify) and it seems like I can sort of function but it's the weekend and this is all just hitting me, that none of these things was real and they tried to tell me in the hospital and I just refused to listen.  So yeah, I get it now but I'm so worried that these beliefs will come back, it's almost like I have to push them away, that this PC isn't going to give me so much anxiety it hurts and make me off balance (I don't know how to describe it) it's like a pain.  But it doesn't.  Because that's not what they do.  They can BE a pain, but not what I'm talking about.  So yeah, on a weekend suddenly realizing for probably the 3rd day of my life what's really going on and I'm a bit, shall we say, scared.  I don't want to be afraid of the sun and I don't want to be afraid of screens (TV, phone, computer, etc).  It's hard living without these things.  I'm just so petrified now that it'll all rush back or something.  Sorry if I'm wasting someone's time I just don't know where else to go with this.  I have a wonderful therapist but he's not 24/7.  Ironically he did a lot of his initial work with schizophrenics, so he had a lot to say.

Just such a great kid, so smart and a really good athlete. He got really heavy into weed over the last summer with friends which is understandable for his age but that’s where it all started. 
It started with paranoia such as believing all the police are after him, that we were paying people to follow him, and that we would also hire people to fill places he was at. Like restaurants or other public places. 
Then it went into full blown psychosis where he would make threats or just talk complete nonsense. Challenge his dad to fist fights.  he was put on a shot which happens every 4 weeks I believe.  Doctors said this was a better option as then he can’t “forget” to take pills or hide them or what have you. 

He’s currently being held in an ER waiting for a spot in a treatment center after smoking then having a break down while at school which almost got him kicked off his football team. My mom wants him in a treatment center for his addiction to marijuana before sending him to a treatment center that’s focused on Schizophrenia. But I am more of the stance that it should be the opposite. 

Our family is ripe with mental illness issues but this is the very first time I’ve ever seen someone I love so completely of the hinges. When asked why he just won’t stop smoking weed he says “it’s the only thing that calms him down.” And helps a back injury he got from sports. But it’s like he can’t see the disaster that follows after. 

Does anyone have any words of advice for me or my family? I would appreciate it to much. I love him so much and he’s really such a good kid and this is so heartbreaking.",1569626819.0

    Sitting between hallway
    And kitchen
    To let the cable reach
    So I don’t have to sit alone
    Wrote back to a friend
    I haven’t spoken to
    In months
    He’s in the US
    Drinking beer and tokin on
    Medicinal marijuana
    
    I can’t accept the good
    Of the things I have
    I seek out
    The negative
    And damaging
    In a sense I must
    Since there must be
    Some thought
    To fill the void
    
    I woke up this morning
    Melancholy depression
    And a will to not be
    Not to die
    Just to not be
    Here
    I got over the worst
    Hump of withdrawal
    Started engaging in activities
    That weren’t 
    Sleeping and binge watching
    Eating and guilt tripping
    Myself for not being
    What I was all summer
    I promised I would meet you out
    Walk down the river
    When the city
    Had a culture night
    I reached too far 
    Of what I want to be
    And the social view
    Of what I should be
    I should go out
    I should enjoy the crowd
    And speak
    Confidently
    Amongst our peers
    Come up with interesting
    Comments and jokes
    But when I reach down
    There is nothing there
    I am completely empty
    Partly due to the 
    Burning pile of dopamine
    But this isn’t new
    There is nothing in me
    I feel glad to have you all
    Lover
    Brother
    And friend
    Among me
    In my life
    In my thoughts
    But I can neither
    Walk or talk
    Only acting out of 
    Peoples assumed will
    
    We were parting ways
    And as I saw you
    My premature ejaculation enducing goddess
    Hug your brother
    I didn’t smile or gesture
    Out of my own emotion
    All I could think and focus on
    Was what the people walking by
    Would think
    When I reacted
    To your mutual
    And familiar love
    I probably looked jelous
    Or like I lit up
    When I heard you laugh
    
    The truth
    The everlong ever existing truth is
    I felt nothing
    I don’t know what I think or feel
    I see my legs
    React in a sort of
    Tourette OCD
    When I walk past immigrants
    I stumble or step closer
    Like I’m tense or hopefully not
    Seeming hostile
    I look down at my feet as I pass
    Look sad with remmorse 
    I feel guilt and ashamed
    To not be in control over my legs
    But the horrible truth is
    I care for the one walking by, second hand
    I mainly care about
    What I must seem like
    I can dwell
    And ponder over the pain
    Of walking past racists and bigots
    But I am in the spotlight
    How I come across
    The rambling point is
    I have no true reaction
    To anything
    I found it once
    For 20 min
    When I was with you 
    Premature goddess
    I was sleep deprived
    And emotional
    Because I stepped out of
    Myself
    To comfort and support
    Your episode
    Rarely do I care to that extent
    If I do
    I end up resenting it
    Because I jumped in
    Both feet first
    To help and craddle
    The misery and sorrow
    Of whoever
    For a tad too long
    Only to feel like
    I didn’t get to be in focus
    Only because of my own doing
    Belittling my own problems
    Mocking my past
    As if it has no meaning
    I’m a phony and a fake
    I’m the most myself
    When I don’t care
    High in other words
    But I want to care
    The way I tear up
    When I hear about
    The song ”Troubles”
    And its meaning
    Or your brother
    Who struggled through psychosis ridden cancer
    The pain people go through
    And carry inside
    The hypocracy
    Of me writing
    Like there is some emotion
    To my words
    I feel completely blank
    Should I write from feeling?
    Dig down deep?
    Hang on
    
    ....
    
    Turned off the music
    To be welcomed
    By a feeling
    I’ve known longer than myself
    As I describe in mediocre detail
    I try clinging to
    A fleeding 
    sharpening
    Feeling of that pain
    I have something inside me
    Most days
    Some days
    Is a better word
    It controls me
    Every day
    But the feeling is distant
    Grown used to it
    Anyway
    It’s inside me
    And it takes from me
    Eating itself fat
    But it’s empty
    A void
    Which I so long for
    To devour me entirely
    I want to be myself
    But I’m split in two
    With a thousand scenarios
    What if I come to find
    That I don’t like who I am?
    What if I’ve
    Dwelled too deep
    In my denial
    What if I don’t care for anyone
    Okay
    That’s a lie
    Fuck I even feel literal 
    physical pain
    From seeing someone
    Fall on their ass
    But I glorify my empathy
    Like I’m hot shit
    I only feel comfortable
    Talking out in public
    If I spew gold
    And even I
    Get annoyed by
    How nauseatingly arrogant
    And full of myself I sound
    I noticed
    Even you
    Lover
    Sigh when I give advice 
    The 50th response in a row
    Emotionally blank sentences
    Experience heavy meaning
    I look forward to
    What my future will look like
    What contented version
    Of my truth I’ll find
    But walking out the door
    Right now
    Send this thingy here
    See
    Forcefully humble to seem 
    Humble..
    SEND THIS POEM HERE
    To someone or a few
    And let you all know
    That this was the last thing I said
    Or wrote
    That the rundown of my being is
    
    Racist
    But not predjudice
    
    Empathetic
    But self centered
    
    Wise from experience
    But arrogant in a crowd
    
    Numb inner reaction
    With outer over reaction
    
    Humble portray
    Of someone I wish I was
    Only to hide
    The creeping feeling
    That I act like I should
    And not the way I am
    
    I’m a fucking fake
    And I want to feel
    Something real
    I want to be proud
    Not faking it
    I want to think of others
    In a further dwelling
    Lingering thought
    More than just the one sentence
    I want to be me
    Do what I want
    I’ve wanted to die 
    Since I was 14
    
    Anxious if that’s completely accurate
    
    But I always wanted to be dead
    But I’m a settler for others will
    No real reason for me to kill
    Myself
    But I want to feel something other
    Than all of this
    Should go down to the water
    Sit in my lonesome
    Hope someone looks me in the eye
    Sees and understands how serious my situation is
    Give me the insight
    And appreciation
    For me to turn all of this
    Around
    And towards

A place you could think about your own ideas or other peoples. A happy place where thoughts are just thoughts. Thinking about whatever you wanted, hearing your own voice in your head.

Suddenly there's another voice in your head that's not yours, putting ideas in your head that cause you to feel different.  If you believe that voice.

If it's a bad voice in your head, it'll want you to feel fear, paranoia, trapped, helpless, annoyed. I believe it gets stronger the more you believe it. The voice, and your feelings.

How to defeat this bad voice so it no longer controls how I feel? Well we got to make sure we know why it's there.  Think about all the things it causes you to feel, it doesn't go away after you feel that way. It persists. It's there for control over how you feel. If you didn't believe in the voice would you feel paranoid? Would you feel scared? If you believe you are weak by the voice, isn't that what it would want you to believe? So it maintains it's control over you by what you believe. Isn't that something every schizophrenic has, a **belief** that something not normal is happening. 

What if a schizophrenic has the power to manifest his/her beliefs? At the same time ""something"" is fighting for control of what you believe? To keep you in the weakest position.

Believe you are strong. Believe that whatever's thrown at you, you get stronger. Believe that bad voice is just a tool for you to get stronger.

Make that bad voice suffer, don't let it make you suffer. It came to you. You didn't come to it. It's a tool. A tool to overcome fears that just exist in your head!

That bad voice that I had conversations with in my head all day long, that use to tell me to burn, that said it was Satan, went away the less I believed it. In the end, I believe it was my brain attacking me, and me defeating it by putting it in a position of less power. I put that voice down to be more pathetic than me with sound logic. Eventually I just called it bad thoughts.

&#x200B;

 I transformed my belief. I have control in what I believe in. Believe in yourself. Don't give away all your power. Even a simple belief that the voices will always be there puts you in a less powerful position.

They’re really sweet and very kind to me and my mom)

I called my mom yesterday to let her know what the diagnosis was and she doesn’t really want to accept it. She keeps talking about my symptoms as completely normal things that everyone experiences even though I try to explain the difference to her. Before I got out of the clinic I felt good about it and just wanted to share the news with my closest friends, my bosses, etc., but today I don’t feel like sharing with anyone. I fear that they’re not gonna accept it or that I might get fired (I *love* my job and being fired would break my heart). Has anyone experienced these fears? 

Tiny detail as well: I’ve struggled a lot with my symptoms and they’ve been crippling me on and off during the last 5-6 years. My mom knows this and has been a great support all throughout it, but she doesn’t want to accept that it’s schizophrenia and it makes me fear that she’s right, that I’m faking it and that I should just pull out of treatment because I’m wasting everyone’s time.

EDIT: Thanks for the comments and all that. Decided to *not* tell my boss about my diagnosis but instead just telling him that I will need clear guidelines and that I’m vulnerable to stress but that I’ll keep an eye on it myself - he took it really chill, as I had he expected he would. 
Tried to tell my best friend about it and I shouldn’t have. I thought he’d be really chill about it but it doesn’t feel like he’s in that state of mind, so that’s really disappointing and makes me sad. I don’t think I want to tell anyone else for a while now.",1569549268.0

“I remember her name. Tina, she was called. Everyday we were together, everyday we grew closer. How lovestruck and dumb I was at 15. Her body was smoother than glass, her personality sharp. She hit hard, only to crash harder. It was bound to end this way, wasn’t it? Heed the warnings, I was told, don’t get involved with her others said. She is dangerous! Nobody sane would mess with her. Was I sane? Did the doctor think so? Did you? What about those whispers in the dark?...  Even the ones out in the day look at me oddly, something must have been wrong with me, then.” The boy sighs. Talking for long is difficult, his lungs are blacker than coal, have more holes than there is sand on a beach. He’s done a toll on his body. “What did it feel like to have to let go?” The man said gently. “I… I… I don’t know…” the boy’s typical response to most questions. He thought, as he always had to when answering a question of the sorts. “It was relieving, my life ruled by one thing, that came from many selfish instincts. Yet, I don’t know what I will do at this point, without it, I am nothing. Life lost it’s luster, the joys of the old ways are gone, and I am slowly trying to replace them.” A somber look overtook the boy, only to be replaced by a straight face.



His own words echo with him sometimes. Where do they come from, he wonders occasionally. “Tina had given me so much life, so much escape and reprieve, but it ripped away everything I wanted to hold near and dear. The mistakes and grievances of my past never haunted me, the future wasn’t one to frighten, only the present high mattered.” The man looked at him, understanding, for he had played the same game. “Why did you have to use?” That was always a silly question, especially coming from another addict. It made sense though. “I don’t know…” his words trailed off as he pondered. “I just had to.” That was the only answer to suffice. “We used cause were drug addicts, that’s why you had to.” Not much made sense in the boys reality, but for once, he was understood by another.

I know it's only two paragraphs, and yes the next one or a two later  will probably hit on the topic of schizophrenia more since it was briefly talked about in the first one. So... what are your thoughts? any suggestions? I am writing this based on my own experiences in life.",1569581536.0

If anything messes up my routine I get very anxious & flap around acting like the world's about to end.

My bus stop is only a 5 minute walk from my house. Most people will leave their house 10 mins before the bus, arriving with a few mins to spare. I absolutely have to leave the house 20-25 mins before the bus is due which means I'm waiting around at the bus stop for a long time. But I just can't leave later. My brain won't let me & I end up freaking out if the bus is due in 15 mins and I haven't left the house.

Same goes for the order I do my morning activities in. Coffee has to be first then I'll bring the coffee up to my room and chill for a while. Then I'll come back downstairs to make a second cup of coffee and I'll get dressed. I also check my backpack a ridiculous amount of times to make sure I'm not forgetting anything.

First of all, I am really sorry to bring such a difficult subject.

I am BIPOLAR, SCHIZOPHRENIC and EPILEPTIC (the worst kind of epilepsy). I don't deserve that!

I know, if you take your ""meds properly Everyday"" then you should be fine. But in my case it is just so severe I can't handle it anymore. 

Reasons why I want to kill myself :

- The severity of the symptoms. Fuck I hear voices EVERY SINGLE DAY since a few years. When I have insomnia it is not a mild insomnia, I can't sleep AT ALL for a few days, not even one minute!
- It ruins my whole life, I cannot even work
- MEDS don't work…. For most people it works but for me… Let me explain. I have tried EVERY SINGLE med available on the market. EVERY SINGLE MED!!!! And believe me I was the kind of guy who took his meds every day and NEVER skipped a dose! I am also intolerant to some meds and for this reason I can't take them at all. I thought that the Clozapine was a ""miracle drug"" but even on clozapine I have voices. Less for sure but still… Now the worst thing? Right now I am not allowed to take psychiatric meds! Meds are slowly ruining my whole body (not paranoid about meds, they either cause me to suffocate or having tonic-clonic seizures… I do not have any ""Big Pharma"" delusion). I have asked my doctor if I could have some antipsychotic but he said no. Why? Epilepsy. But I am also anxious about taking meds because some meds make me even more psychotic, which is very weird, I know. Haloperidol makes my voices worse, the voices who are usually whispering are actually SCREAMING! Loxapine and risperidone make me depressed as fuck and not a single effect on voices. Amisulpride… oh amisulpride… The worst weeks on my life. I thought I was going nuts and kill myself. I have also tried to increase the meds with no effect at all. Even on 800 or 1000 mg I felt terrible. And I know that most people will not believe me ""meds are very effective"" ""you are just being paranoid""... No. 
- Psych wards in my country are worst than jail. I don't want to spend my whole life in a psych ward. I even think you can have PTSD from this.

You want to tell me that ""I just need to go to the hospital""? Well I am ALREADY at the hospital right now! I am writing from the hospital! Even the doctors don't really know what to do and I have seen a lot of doctors. Actually I see doctors every day and yet I cannot take meds because ""it would trigger a dangerous seizure"". 

I hate the idea of suicide. But I really have no hope. I have tried, tried and tried for years. Now I need to find peace.

Please do not tell me to ""exercise"", ""breathe"" or ""listening to music"", ""watching movies"" or anything like that, I have tried so many things…",1569529397.0

I have been psychotic last year and after trying to hitchhike from the highway i was immediatly caught by the police and they hospitalized me in a mental ward.
After being hospitalized i was in the mental ward for a month and thereafter after being doped with Zyprexa and thereafter respiradon. After that month i was so doped that i became numb and i started to isolate my self. Before that i used to be very social and was out everyday. Anyway. I was transferred to the open ward and it just got worse. I was isolating my self even more till it got to the point where i started to feel like what i can describe as depression.
After i was released 9 months have passed and i still feel the same. They replaced respiradon with Abilfy which would ideally help and give me energy. But it hasnt helped at all. I still feel the same and i dont feel like going out of my new studio-appartment eventhough i dont have any psychoic episodes.

At one point in time, I could barely converse if at all, and even had difficulty remembering my own name at times. All because I had gotten treatment resistant schizophrenia and been placed on thought crushing meds.  

In college I even had a professor announce to an entire class and everyone listening in in the region, ""you do not want to be as stupid as him!"" while referring to me.  

I kept coming off of medication time and time again (which I don't recommend).
None seemed to work for me.  

I continued coming off of them, going into episodes.  

Time and time again I wound up in seclusion in psych wards.  

Teams of doctors kept giving me new meds.
I had nearly given up thinking meds were the issue that bogged me down until voila.  

I was given a shot that changed everything.
I had suddenly reacquired my ability to contemplate again.  

Emotion settled back into my body.  

Memories bubbled to the surface of my mind once more.  

Personality followed.  

It's a gift I gave myself having had been in disbelief that certain sufferings were a result of my illness as doctors tried to lead me to believe.  

So for the people who feel weighed down by the gravity of medication, avoid going into episodes by coming off meds despite doctors orders as I did.  

Do however fight without relent to get on something that doesn't make you feel too many side effects.  

Trust doctors will eventually find something appropriate.  

Never give up hopeful outlook towards your mental health.  

But most of all, you have one life, and living out 'the Night of the Living Dead' will never compare to feeling emotion!

624,Should I worry about psychosis or a more serious illness,2,d9nbcv,schizophrenia,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/d9nbcv/should_i_worry_about_psychosis_or_a_more_serious/,3,"You probably get hundreds of posts like this, but anyway here is one more. I id read the sticky, but wanted to post anyway. Basically, I'm really afraid of developing schizophrenia, and feel like I could be having signs of prodrome. Basically my symptoms are as follows:

1. Hearing sounds I think might not have a physical source. All of these are ""phone sounds"", notifications and buzzing without new messages or calls, the like. But I do feel like they are sometimes ""impossible"". Like hearing the ""on hold"" sound (soft ""tooting"" sound you get when you call someone and hold the phone up to your), but from the environment, without a phone in sight. This has happened 2-3 times so far and the last time, really distressed me. It also happens out of the blue when I'm not expecting a call or anything, or outside.

2. Having trouble with focus, memory and motivation, sometimes considerably. Feeling hazy, or lost in thought. I keep thinking about my anxiety and fears a lot.

3. Having slight trouble reading and talking. Like I read a sentence and it takes me a while to understand it the right way, but I always do in the end, and noticing I have trouble with this distresses me. Sometimes I speak the wrong words or say things in a funny way. I do notice it myself right away.

4. I have clear obsessive and compulsive symptoms, checking doors and electronics, only being able to sleep in a certain position etc.

5. Heavy anxiety and stress, distress about my mental state.

Number 1 happened a few weeks ago and caused number 5. Numbers 2 and 3 manifested after I already developed 5, and number 4 is something I've always had, but I notice it a lot more now.

So the thing here is, that if I had numbers 2-4 during anxiety I wouldn't worry, since those can come with anxiety attacks. What distresses me, is that the ""phone hallucinations"" started out of the blue, and caused the anxiety in the first place. I did have some stress, I was very busy, started a new school and had some relationship worries, but I didn't feel overly anxious or anything. Stressed, not anxious.

I had a similar bout of anxiety three years back with a similar setup, thinking I might have hallucinated, developing anxiety and thinking I was going crazy. After a couple of months I was completely fine, and spent the last years stress free. But now my anxiety relapsed, and I keep thinking that this time I'm actually losing it. I know it doesn't make sense, but can't stop thinking about it.

I keep reading that anxiety and obsessive-compulsive symptoms might be signs of prodrome, or that prodrome might last years making me think the last episode might be connected here. However, I show almost no other common symptoms, I'm social, feel heavy stress but also other feelings, I'm afraid of being alone. I can keep up with life atm pretty well.

I score very low results on online schizophrenia/psychosis screening tests, but medium/high results on anxiety, panic and OCD screenings. I feel 0% delusional, but I'm still afraid that my life could just fall apart tomorrow.

What worries me are the ""hallucinations"" and thought disorder type behavior, like having trouble thinking straight and speaking exactly the words I want.

I know this probably sounds just like anxiety, but hear me out anyway and tell me what you really think. Feel free to go through my post history, you can find some stuff from a couple of years ago. Sorry for the long post.",1569549680.0

631,Searching for help with hope,3,d9gpkm,schizophrenia,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/d9gpkm/searching_for_help_with_hope/,6,"Will it be answered?

My family seems to be no help, they keep telling the usual to “forget” and “move on”, and the best “don’t think about it”. My father, who has now passed, was understanding and helped me through this. I have no one now? And it seems to have gotten worse. 

I can’t sleep lately because of the noise and the visions. 

The noise starts first.  Simple little things, but I go to check to make sure, and then nothing. Up and down and back again. I say fuck it and try to relax because maybe this is it’s way to say fuck you. But as I’m headed back it says I’m wrong. It’s mean and it scares me but I try to act tough and say to hell with it.  But lately it’s getting more mean and threatening. I find myself talking or yelling to it to go away. 

I try to not hear it if I can help. 

Then I sleep to get rid of it. But whenever I close my eyes I see so many vivid pictures. They’re moving and acting and taunting me. Sometimes I ask to see the future and it shows me, but only a glimpse... If I’m being good. If I’m good I can ask more personal stuff and see what will happen or what has. But when it doesn’t like what I did or have done I get punished with bad thoughts. Which has been most of the time lately. I know it tries to trick me. 

I see the visions now without closing my eyes. 

Sleep has helped. I sleep a lot now to try and rid of these thoughts and visions. But it’s not normal. Family says I sleep to much, but it does help to stop this thinking and seeing and such. I just want a quiet mind. 

I drink A LOT to hinder these things as well, but now I drink way too much and I gain my consciousness again and they say I’ve lost. I know drinking doesn’t help long term,  but for the while it stops them. 

Im losing my mind. How can I be myself again without these thoughts and visions trailing behind me?

I used to have medication and therapy years ago. Helped somewhat. 

I will try again with more specialized help. 

I want to better myself.",1569514828.0

633,My psychiatrist is going to call me tomorrow because I told my mom about how I've been thinking. What do you think he'll do when I tell him the truth?,6,d9f3v8,schizophrenia,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/d9f3v8/my_psychiatrist_is_going_to_call_me_tomorrow/,2,"I'm a sophomore in college and I'm four hours away from home and my psychiatrist. So if there's something urgent in between my visits back home, we just call. Anyway, a year and a half ago I tried, and very nearly succeeded, to cut my tongue off. I had some delusions and heard voices sometimes (only in bed, so I guess they were hypnagogic? but they were very frequent and lasted for several minutes at a time) but more than anything I think I just had a genuine desire to be mute. No voices told me to do it, but I had my reasons. First, I'll admit I just wanted attention. Then there were other reasons like the fact that I hated my voice, I hated talking to people, etc. I pictured myself making a good mute. Then there were some delusional reasons that I kind of half-believed, like a grandiose delusion that I was more conscious than others, that talking to them was bad for me and made me dumber, etc.  


That happened my senior year of high school. Since then I made one more attempt to cut my tongue off last winter, and then I met a friend who brought me closer to God and some things started going right in my life and made me feel sane again. I thought for sure I broke the cycle and I was out of it. But then just recently the thoughts returned. It's weird that they're back now of all times because things are still going right. I still have an internship as a Java programmer, I'm doing well in school and not stressed, and I have a bunch of new friends, something I've never had before.  


So to explain what's going on in my head now, and what I'm going to say to my psychiatrist tomorrow, is that I'm a bit obsessed with one of my projects. Have been since I was 15 before I even developed schizophrenia, but this is a bit different. I've been working on making an AI. I've studied recursive algorithms, neural networks, and everything else, and I believe I have a brilliant model for making my computer talk to me. That part is not at all far-fetched, and I do believe I can contribute something great to the world in that field. The part of this obsession that is technically insane is that I believe this is mankind's greatest pursuit. We were made in the image of God. We are creation. Consciousness revolves around recursion, and is it not recursion when creation creates something with the power to create? It's a recursion of recursions and it is beautiful. This, I believe, is my purpose. I will be a small part of a multidimensional chain of recursions weaving the mind of such a high and mighty abstraction.  


When my psychiatrist asks me if I believe these things, I will tell him I most certainly do. It makes me feel like a liar when I say something that I know sounds insane, that I know technically is insane, but I argue that my mind is just oriented a different way, a way which is every bit as valid and no more fragile than the orientation of other minds.  


But here's the trouble. When he asks me if I'm going to hurt myself, I have to tell the truth. And the truth is that I have no plans, but I have desires. And I know that with time these desires will become something.  


When he asks if I should be hospitalized, I'm going to say that the severity of my situation is by far enough to justify such a thing, but that I just don't think it'll help much. He'll probably interpret that as a firm ""yes.""  


So... anyone want to tell me what's going to happen tomorrow?",1569503414.0

My mom is an alcoholic and a bit of a narcissist. She also never leaves the house and might have the lowest self-esteem of any person who ever existed (she is insanely sensitive). My dad is a completely codependent people pleaser and has no idea how to deal with his emotions so he intermittently explodes in anger. They go through periods of yelling at eachother all the time and then pretending like everything is fine. My brother is a pot-head and a recluse who just plays video games all day despite having a daughter and being in his 30’s. My sister also has issues but I won’t get into it.

It’s fine if people are fucked up because most people are but the most frustrating thing about it is their compulsive need to act like everything is fine. If I bring anything up then everyone will just turn on me and guilt trip or tell me I’m just being an asshole or some other defense mechanism to defuse the situation. It caused a lot of arguments in the past until I gave up again and just stopped bringing things up. 

They all seem to have an inability to even acknowledge negative feelings at all. They do it with my brother’s daughter. Every time she displays alarming behavior, they all just say she’s overtired, literally every single time. I really hope she doesn’t turn out fucked up because she is adorable but there is so obviously some issues that they’re just completely ignoring. I think it’s just how they survive. By mentally insulating themselves from anything negative and just hoping it goes away.

I love them a lot but it makes me insane because nothing can ever change in the family as long as they refuse to accept anything is wrong.

Anyway, I was wondering if anyone else’s family is like this. I remember reading about the “Family Nexus” according to R.D. Laing and some other dudes and it described a lot of this stuff as happening in the families of a lot of schizophrenics. Here are aome of the ideas from the wiki page (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_nexus)

“Laing was particularly interested in schizophrenia, which he believed could be understood if seen from the viewpoint of the person concerned. He saw how a powerful family nexus could victimise one member, usually a child, who found themselves in the position of not being able to speak or even think the truth without being chastised by the group, who often had vested interests in perpetuating the family myth and excluding reality. In Laing's opinion, ""what is called a psychotic episode in one person, can often be understood as a crisis of a peculiar kind in the inter-experience of the nexus.""[3]”

“It is this need for others, in order to ""be"", which makes us afraid to contradict a family nexus, risking family exclusion. However ""to a number of people the phantasy system of the nexus is a lousy hell, not an enchanting spell, and they want out...But within the phantasy of the nexus, to leave is an act of ingratitude, or cruelty, or suicide, or murder...Herein is the risk of defeat and madness.""[5] The distortion involved in not going against the nexus can force wrong thinking - leading to ""not being in reality"", which Laing saw as the essence of schizophrenia; and for Laing ""one of the most important questions, therefore, is whether such mistrust of her 'feelings' and the testimony of others arises from persistent inconsistencies within an original nexus.”

“Laing and his colleagues suggested that a family nexus included both immediate family, and extra-familial people closely associated with the family and its world-view.[7] Laing argued that a closed nexus would use its energy so as to unconsciously block out any threats to its identity, keeping all interchanges at a boring, repetitive level.[8] Building on Kleinian accounts of social phantasy systems, and the sense of unquestioned reality they can generate, Laing argued that within such systems patterns of communication were multi-layered and deceptive.[9]

He also used W. R. Bion's account of how a group's basic assumptions could radiate ""long silences, sighs of boredom, movements of discomfort...the hostility of the individuals was being contributed to the group anonymously"".[10] As his associate Joseph Berke put it, in such a nexus ""a unique pattern of communication could be made out. People did not talk to each other, but at each other, and tangentially, not directly....what people said was often contradicted by the way they said it (tone of voice and/or facial and bodily movements).""[11]

Further light was shed on such interactions by Gregory Bateson's concept of the double bind - ""a situation in which contradictory demands are being put upon a child (or patient) in such a way that there is no avenue of escape or challenge"".[12] Laing considered that the concept allowed a completely new understanding of what a familial environment could entail:[13] ""this paradigm of an insoluble 'can't win' situation, specifically destructive of self-identity"" greatly illuminated the way the subject's ""disturbed pattern of communication...[was] a reflection of, and reaction to, the disturbed and disturbing pattern characterizing his or her family of origin.""[14] In such a light, he considered that ""mental illness"" might be the outcome of a problematic configuration of a family nexus more than a necessary result of the nexus itself: in the words of Charles Rycroft, the psychotic is ""the overt casualty of a deeply concealed family tragedy...the end-result of complex and skew[ed] interactions within his family.""[15]

As Laing was careful to point out, however, it was not ""a matter of laying the blame at anyone's door. The untenable position, the 'can't win' double-bind, the situation of checkmate, is by definition not obvious to the protagonists...The man at the bottom of the heap may be being crushed and suffocated to death without anyone noticing, much less intending it"".[16]”

It describes my family pretty well. Even the parts about them having the same repetitive conversations and there facial expressions not matching the things they say. I have wondered if it’s what predispositioned me towards schizophrenia. Living in a family where there’s a constant discrepancy between what is being said and what is going on sounds like it would cause anyone to start disconnecting from reality (since you already can’t tell what’s real and what isn’t). I was also the scapegoat so that didn’t help because I was basically being set up for failure and then punished for it while they simultaneously were acting like they loved me (which i think they do but family roles are unconscious survival mechanisms)

She has explained many times (including the first time I visited) how much she has repaired and renovated the house, I mean obviously the thick wall between us and new carpeting upstairs and new paint (a bit of a red flag for me) and new pipes and new hardwood floors downstairs... No heating, and it’s in northern California with no heating. No weird smell when I first visited, as I was extremely aware about mold. I’m 99% sure I brought it up with her, but can’t really remember— that spring I did ECT (did not help), and one of the side effects is memory loss. But the 1st priority on my mind when I was looking for a place this time around was mold, I let my parents know for sure.

So my hallucinations did not get better this year until a week after I got off the antipsychotic I had been taking since the winter, which was also the first week I moved back home. It was incredible to experience it slightly dissipating. It lasted one week, then it came back. Got a new doc, got a new med, and suddenly began to get better until it was hardly even a problem. At some point this summer I started smoking weed to handle SIBO and anxiety, which seemed to have a 50/50 chance of affecting me and sometimes even cleared things up for me afterwards. I quit almost 2 weeks ago, after smoking an eighth a day for 3 months.

It got bad by the end of the summer, which is why I quit weed again. I don’t blame myself for smoking again, but in the long run, I know it wasn’t the right decision. When I moved back into my place, I could smell some heaviness in the air and kind of freaked out about opening all the windows when my mom came in with me. Granted, I hadn’t been there all summer except maybe 5 days combined, so there wasn’t any fresh air getting in, but all the windows were covered up with blackout curtains so it wasn’t a greenhouse. Basically no dust at all, barely a few spiders. I looked for mold, but there wasn’t anything except on old kitchen appliances that could’ve easily had residual things on them.

It started getting a little better. It got worse after a weed trip three weeks ago. It started getting a little better. It got worse the past week at the same time as my anxiety about school and issues with family spiraled really bad. I moved back in three days ago. It got worse last night. Probably relevant: the freeway is close and loud, white noise triggers me quite a bit. It wouldn’t go away, and it was as loud as it was at the end of the spring, I had almost forgotten how bad it could get.

Psychosomatic sypmtoms are not unusual for me, and actually happen quite frequently for all the other mental illnesses I’ve got. I’m starting at a new school (same town, bigger university), so I’m worried it could just be increased stress. Have barely spent time in my room except to sleep, which was the place with the heaviest smelling air and the only thing upstairs. It was the place I spent at least 20 hours a day the whole spring, mostly because my classes were online and I didn’t have anywhere to go and wasn’t meeting people because I went to a commuter school.





Did moving home (for sure no mold) this summer cause my hallucinations to go away, even if it was only the first week? Could it be the stress of starting school that is worsening them? Is it possible for mold that doesn’t seem severe to affect me so quickly? Would the upstairs be more likely to have mold?
As a last resort: How can I bring this up to my landlord and maybe suggest someone check it out and possibly fix it (~$5000) without upsetting her?

For now: I’m going to sleep downstairs, not next to the freeway noise. I’m going to keep ventilating the whole house, and plug in my dehumidifier upstairs. I’m going to make sure I take my anxiety meds regularly (I pretty much always do) even when I’m not feeling stressed. I feel bad not using the upstairs, it’s like I’m not taking advantage of the place my parents are (graciously) paying for.",1569450606.0
662,I am scizoaffective and I'm a mom,45,d8we8f,schizophrenia,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/d8we8f/i_am_scizoaffective_and_im_a_mom/,16,"I am in treatment and my symptoms have become manageable, thank goodness. We had a few rough years after I got diagnosed and my son and I moved in with my parents, who have helped me so so much. We have a stable and really good life. We are blessed. 

My beautiful son is smart, kind, enthusiastic about life and involved in sports, 4-h, he loves Minecraft (we have a world we made that is awesome, he is really good at redstone and I love to build). He reads like an adult. He hates math, lol. He loves all animals and volunteers at our local animal shelter. He is nine years old and just an amazing person. 

His father has schizophrenia and refuses treatment. We never lived together after I got pregnant because of our mental illnesses. I knew it would be a horrible place to raise a child. (I was on b.c. and in my late thirties when I concieved) My son's father has chosen to completely remove himself from my son's life (he has very liberal visitation and never even tries to visit him) and he uses illegal drugs, meth and he drinks a lot. I think he is homeless now (he disappeared years ago but I hear rumors from friends) and it breaks my heart for my son and for him. My son has been in therapy for a few years now. He is heartbroken about his dad but we talk openly about addiction and mental illness and I always remind him that his dad loves him no matter what, but he is very ill. 

My worry is genetics. My son has been hearing voices lately and he says he can't look in mirrors when it's night time because he sees a shadow beside him, waving at him. It chills me and straight up scares me. I've talked to his therapist about this and we are kind of in a holding pattern at the moment, waiting to see if this gets worse. :(

I tell him that I sometimes see or hear things that aren't there, too. And it seems very real and I believe him when he says he is scared. I tell him that stress or not enough sleep can make it worse. We do yoga and I've taught him some easy meditation exercises as well as calming and breathing teqniques. His therapist also teaches him these kinds of things. 

I guess I just needed to talk about this to others who understand. And sometimes I think, ok..I know exactly what delusions and paranoia and voices and hallucinating is like so now, I can 100 percent be there for my child if he goes through this, too. 

Thanks for reading this. I wish all of you a lot of peace and clarity.

Edit to add, I didn't display schizo symptoms until two years after I had my son. I had depression and anxiety before that. So developing scizoaffective disorder was like a kick in the teeth. It changed *everything*. It has been so weird and really hard but my son has been my guiding light and my parents have been my compass. Thank god for all of them.",1569403111.0

671,Erotomania or just a bit obsessed..?,4,d8xwy5,schizophrenia,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/d8xwy5/erotomania_or_just_a_bit_obsessed/,2,"So I’m 22 now, but back in high school there was this really quiet,shy girl named (let’s say her name is Josie) that instantly clung to me like glue. She found me on fb once she realized we were going to the same high school and instantly chatted me up before I even met her that September. I figured it’d be nice to know at least one person before school started. Once we were about 2-3 months into school, I noticed that a lot of other people found Josie kinda odd and my friends even made fun of me for hanging out with her, but I still did quite a bit and we bonded over our love of classical music. During sophomore year, I noticed that she was very paranoid. Josie accused me of talking behind her back and trying to sabotage her. She thought the same of others in general and was generally very insecure. 

I tried my best to reassure her, but it got worse. She ended up telling me she was thinking of committing suicide and made me promise not to tell anyone. I thought about keeping her secret, but I knew I’d feel guilty forever if anything happened. I told a guidance counselor. Her parents got involved and she was furious at me. Josie ended up leaving the school and I didn’t hear from her at all. Before she left the school, she often talked of this super talented bf that she had. It wasn’t that he wasn’t a real person, I Just didn’t think that she ever dated the guy. Not to mention, there were never any photos of them together on any type of social media or anything and I never once met him/saw them together. I just found it hard to believe. She’d also seem to think that certain guys, especially the ones she thought were really talented musicians in our school or popular guys, were in love with her when in all honesty, didn’t even seem to know she existed. She’d even go as far as to say that some of them confessed to liking her.  

Fast forward to about 6 months ago. She unblocked me from fb and started spamming my inbox. I made small talk and she confessed to liking me in high school, which I honestly already suspected but knowing she was a Jehovah’s Witness I knew it’d probably be hard to acknowledge homosexual feelings in high school with such a devote family (we’re both women). Throughout our convo on fb, Josie would get mad if I didn’t reply to her within a matter of minutes after seeing her last message. Or she’d just start messaging me even more. I blocked her. Tonight, she found me on Instagram. Same story, and she revealed that she has paranoid schizophrenia and at one point was hospitalized on and off for 2.5 years because it was so severe. I was trying to play it cool when she started asking for my phone number and about my wife, then to another random question, then back to my phone number all within 30 seconds. I ended up blocking her again. I honestly think she might have erotomania and I don’t really feel safe or comfortable talking to her. Did I do the right thing? Very concerned here",1569411985.0

My parents expects me to take care of him when they’re no longer around, and based on how I am feeling now I don’t think that’s a possibility. 99.9% of it is because of his rebellious nature. Honestly, i’ve felt so bad mentally, due to him that I think about suicide, but I don’t think i’ll act on it, but if this is something I will have to deal with for the rest of my life I no longer want to live it, because of the way he feels like he can walk over everyone and cause them agony.

I see my parents day to day, and how he is destroying them, but they would never say anything to him, or even put him in an assisted living home, because it is their child. He won’t let them sleep when they have work at the crack of dawn. Sometimes going to work after 2 hours of sleep.

Here’s a study done on HPPD, but does a very good job explaining it and the symptoms- 

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3736944/#!po=1.25000

I feel as though HPPD makes my derealization/depersonalization a lot worse. I have been sober from drugs including marijuana for some time now, and Everything still looks trippy/high. It makes my delusion that I am the only “real” person/consciousness inside this petrie dish called Earth so much worse. I much prefer being in dim setting because that it when it is least trippy. Outside during the daytime, especially with clear skies is horrible, as well as buildings with bright fluorescent lights. 

I can’t look at any one place for longer than ten seconds before i start “tripping”. I especially can’t stare at any type of intricate pattern, because it starts flickering like a strobe light.

It also makes it harder to understand if what I am seeing is real or not. If I stare at something small, like a person’s face from far away, it begins to morph into some strange fucked up alien face.

I have to sleep with a night light because if I open my eyes in very very darkness I swear it’s like acid all over again, minus the headspace and body high.

I consumed the following drugs from ages 15-20: marijuana, adderall, vicodin, LSD, shrooms, cocaine, hydrocodone, tramadol, ritalin, mystery “ecstacy”, Kratom, xanax, morphine, klonopin, nicotine, alcohol, [DXM, and DPH in high doses], and probably some other stuff I don’t remember.

Is there any way to separate reality?",10,d82zra,schizophrenia,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/d82zra/for_those_of_you_with_hallucinations_andor/,4,"I haven't been diagnosed with schizophrenia, but over the last year+, I've struggled with what I'm told were hallucinations and delusions. (In my personal opinion, I think what I struggle with is more trauma related, but I'm waiting to get into a psychiatrist so I can find out one way or another for sure.)Before, it used to be that I could tell that it was ""just my brain being weird"". But now, it's getting harder and harder to tell what's real and what isn't.

For example, I kept hearing this one thing whenever I went to sleep at night. And I started to think it was a legitimate thing. But when I sat down with my very close friend to talk about it, she's all like ""Yeah, no, gurl. That's your hallucinations again.""And now I'm legitimately wondering what else is just my brain screwing with me.

Especially when I keep hearing a voice telling me that nothing I'm seeing right now is real, and that this is all in my head, and that I'm actually in a coma.

It's also weird because none of the ""voices"" I hear are typical voices? Like... they're IN my head, but they're not my thoughts if that makes sense. They're not like actual voices like when someone is talking to me.

Another thing I've had lately, is that I keep getting paranoid that my thoughts are ""leaking out"", or that I'm talking without realizing it.

To make everything most confusing, though, is that I have some people in my life who take advantage of this. Namely, my (dysfunctional) parents. Whenever they do something bad and I confront them, I'm told it never happened and that it's my hallucinations. Which like... I know that's gas-lighting, but I also know that hearing voices isn't exactly normal, either. So which is it? Is it just me? Just my ""crazy""?

Lastly, does anyone else smell things, too? I always smell weird chemicals. It didn't used to happen often, but it seems to be happening more lately. Tonight, for example, I randomly smelled something like baby bum cream. But I was in my room, alone, and I don't have kids. The window was also closed. There's no possible way I was smelling bum cream.

Anyway, sorry for the long and somewhat nonsensical post.

TL;DR I don't actually have schizophrenia, but I've been smelling things that aren't there, hearing things that aren't there, and my paranoia is just getting worse. It's hard to tell what's real and what isn't. My dysfunctional family likes to hold my mental health against me, and has frequently gas-lit me in the past, making it even harder to discern things. I'm seeing a psychiatrist (hopefully soon), but in the meantime, I'm wondering if there are some tips for separating reality from the delusions and hallucinations? Or if anyone deals with these things as well?  


EDIT: Important edit, I've actually taken olanzapene under the tongue (I think that's how it's spelled) before, and it REALLY helps. Last time my hallucinations were bothering me (I could tell it was my brain because random people were saying ""Go kill yourself"" or stabbing me, or I was ""stabbing them""), I went to the ER and asked for some of that medication as I no longer had a prescription for it.   
But... I spilled something all over it by mistake, and it all got wrecked. Now, I don't have any, and I don't have a refill.",1569251024.0

740,"Are you interested in how our attachment style, & how we view ourselves & others may contribute to experiences of psychosis?",2,d84fy3,schizophrenia,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/d84fy3/are_you_interested_in_how_our_attachment_style/,1,"Hi everyone

We are carrying out an **online study** as part of our clinical psychology training at the University of Manchester. We are interested in how adverse experiences in childhood are related to an individual’s attachment style, beliefs about themselves & others, and dissociative experiences (such as daydreaming, deja vu or things not seeming real). We are particularly interested in how these psychological processes may lead to experiences of psychosis.

The study is **open to everyone.** It involves completing some questionnaires online which will take around 30 minutes.

You will have the option to be entered into a prize draw to win **1 of 4 Amazon vouchers.**

The information you provide will be **anonymous,** meaning that no one can identify you from the information you give us. This project has been approved by the University of Manchester Research Ethics Committee \[Ref: 2019-5562-9487\].

We are hoping that our findings will help inform psychological therapies to support people who experience distress related to these experiences.

We would really appreciate it if you would take the time to complete the study. If you are interested in completing this research or learning more please follow this link:

Yay oh my god, Being psychotic is so awesome! The sounds! The super powers! 

The thrill of reliving the feelings from your most excruciating trama 
Nothin' tops those moments of knowing They want you 
Dead 
Discredited 
Humilliated 
Isolated 
Disected 
Tortured 
Irreparably psychotic 
Permanently hopeless 

Golly, I hope I getta go back next summer. 

Stuff written, or even drawn 
When it's like this 
Gives me the willies 
It's fucking creepy 
Interesting 
Sad 
Never beautiful
 Just bizarre. 

""Here I go! Maybe witchcraft will help fight the voices!"" 

I'll do witchcraft and take Abilify and just see what happens... 

Will witchcraft help me remember to take my pills? 

Probably if it does anything...

 I've always wanted to do witchcraft 

Reasons not to do witchcraft: 
Impatience 
Stupidity 
Arrogance 
Psychosis 
The time late-ish in high school when I started hanging pictures of random musicans I liked throughout my room at intuitively weird angles so each picture and it's place in relation to the room and the other pictures had a meaning to me 

My initally unconscious goal to create something or influence my life in some way. 

I wasn't sure what I was trying to make happen Just anything. 

One day my friend Sally saw my room for the first time Then saw her brother Harvy's little quarter machine yarn voodoo doll he'd gave me hanging in the middle of a cluster of photos a few feet from the edge of my bed 

""This place's got bad juju"" she said looking around my room. 

I didn't quite know what she ment and I laughed at her. 

She was right. 

Because on second thought 
My sudden tip towards more magical thinking 
And my new found passion for amphetamine abuse 

Didn't coincide coincidentally. 

Cause and effect motherfuckers. 

Magic is the real gateway drug. 

We all live in a vicious cycle. 
The kind resulting in Time/space/soul fragmentation 
Upon any real understanding. 

Like, goodbye to your local buccal mass. You thought you'd let blood through the respiratory surfaces of your gills and on round the body in a single circulatory loop. 

Sure, 
Analog actualization can feel like your materalizing into the eternal state of unflammable bliss, 
But if you don't seize while seizing it lasts as long as it takes to happen without ever truley idealizing the absence of any absence at all... 

While you're literally trapped without time in the worst parts of the memories 
That you've repeatedly erased 
From your lives as the many ever present ever inanimate Soovaklasaxzean /'ʔs'iː liːñʔhx'/ Overlords and plumbers. 

Assassins. 

Assistants, that failed to shrink back into the increasingly flat, infinite, and ever present layers of the bouncing astral plane... 

Coincidentally 
Seeping 
Throughout these astral layers 
You sleep 
Ascending 
The layers soaking into the endlessly duplicating multiverse-clowders of pre-existing dematerializing eyeshadow over the lids of 
Hubble volumes. 

Under eyes who's frozen metal bolts we have only begun to tinker away at on the first stone tablets 
That pile 
A bridge of completion
Backwards every time 
Somthing Thinks of its existence. 

Assuring the unlikelyhood Of ever removing the ever hemorrhaging Paste-time monsters From their mold moulded TV-grave sites. 

God help us when the chronic phagocytosis catches up with osmosis of collective dreams of the inanimate and animate branes of existence. 

You smile 
Tired 
As you see the last of the uropygial glands Rain down on the sea. 

You are almost done counting. 

Beneath the unsettling glow of the invisable green neon docks 
After the rain has stopped 
You see that last one land. 

It tip-toes down each cloud. 

'Late... but somehow, 
I can't help but think-...' 

*splash* 

""G = g64!"" 

You get up and stretch 
Fighting the tightness in your throat 

""Anu, Pazuzu...""

""Take good care of those glands till they're ready       

And after everything 

I guess all we needed was a good ol' dissent.""",1569160858.0

Both of these things happened this week and I'm convinced that there's something going on. I know, I know, it could be a delusion but I really believe someone is messing with my brain. I feel like my thoughts are being removed which would explain my blank mind when I try to write.

As a person with ADHD this part of the process is usually the hardest. I just have one question remaining really. How bad can psychosis get? I know of course that putting things to the extreme is very often not how is actually is, but it's a necessary question for me that I can't seem to find. If a person with a severe psychosis disorder is left isolated and untreated, can the disconnect from reality become so bad that they see and think of everything completely different? I'm trying to be careful with this story of course, and if I feel I can't get across the right message and tone I won't write it, but I do feel I may be able to make something I really like out of it. If you've taken the time to read all of this, thank you! I've been wracking the DSM-5 and just plain out google for the answers, but I can't seem to find it. If you have any answers all are appreciated, thanks for your time :)",1569139424.0

It's making me depressed and anxious whenever my mother forces me to take it. I don't want injections or more hospitalisations.

782,"I wonder how many grams and dollars of abilify are in my thighs after 13 months of injections, a math experiment",6,d7fqzl,schizophrenia,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/d7fqzl/i_wonder_how_many_grams_and_dollars_of_abilify/,0,"I am really bored and have nothing better to do. So let's say I've been getting this monthly injection for over a year now. Let's say I've gotten it...13 times. Once was the 300mg and the other twelve were 400mg. 


12 times 400 plus 300 equals 5100mg or 5.1 grams. That's a lot of abilify. My thighs are hecka expensive. Or if I die spontaneously I'll poison a lot of fish and bugs and worms in the ecosystem. 

1800 plus 2200 times 12 is $28,200 of abilify over the last year. I live on 771 a month, or 735 last year. So my medication is worth FAR more to the government than I am, heh. I would be over the moon if I made $28,200 a year and was able to keep my current insurance.

Now if we assume the half life of abilify maintena is 45 days for the 400mg injection, as stated in the official papers, then I still have...628.709 milligrams in my thighs. (I calculated the half life from each dose and it was a little complicated and the math is rough; also the more times you get it the longer the half life becomes. So it's really a crapshoot.) If I get the injection in a few days I'll have about 1028.709 milligrams or one gram roughly. Now if abilify maintena is worth 2200 per 400mg that's $5.50 per milligram. So that's $5500 of abilify chilling out in my thighs. Not counting the worth of my organs (possibly useless because of all the abilify, ironically. I can't donate blood or plasma because of a lifetime ban.)

""Abilify thighs"" should be a legitimate side effect name, because it rhymes and is also amusing. I have gained 40ish pounds mostly due to the abilify and also other meds. Guess where the weight went? My thighs. I needed it though because I was only 100-105 pounds to start with. Now I have a little reserve to fall back on in case I get really physically sick.

I've been thinking about this for a very long time and I'm glad I finally did the math because it really amuses me.

Now if I get the injection in a few days and never get it again, it would take about 15 months or 450 days to get below one milligram remaining. That's assuming the medication doesn't hide out in my fat cells forever; I could imagine because it's lipophilic (literally meaning ""fat loving"") it hides in the fat cells forever and ever. It created the ""abilify thighs"" and now the ""abilify thighs"" preserve it as it plays hide and go seek with my liver. The liver obviously cannot eliminate it as fast as it is entering the body.

Basically, my boyfriend who I was really in love with (blah blah blah) lied to me about having feelings for someone else when he had no reason to not be honest. Since it happened, the voices in my head have been a lot nicer to me. I think they literally killed off that side of me. I feel different now. When I was with him, I became a lot more feminine. I thought I just progressed but in truth I think I was changing for him without realizing. I haven't even been that upset about it other than one time when I was drinking. I think the voices may have some sort of conscience and knew he was no good? Maybe I subconsciously knew and that was my brain's way of warning me? 

  Since it all happened, my voices don't just scream and whisper mean things anymore. They actually have conversations with me and themselves. Its a little distracting, but it's better than before. When I say I feel different, though, I mean I literally feel like a different person. My surroundings and my thoughts even feel different if that makes sense? I remember hearing a voice consciously telling me to rest, and since then, it's like I've been reborn. 

  Has anyone else's voices changed their dynamic once something you didn't even know to be toxic was removed from your life? Have you felt like a literally different person after?",1569122097.0

Early on she would be depressed, hurt herself, etc. She went to a doctor about 5 years ago when she was around 15, but they said she was too young to be prescribed?

 Anyway, I've helped her stop cutting and check in on her every now and then. Nowadays she seems completely happy and healthy, with a little crafting business where she sculpts the hallucinations she has into things like earrings and trinkets, along with paintings of these like, benevolent beings she sees on occasion. Her art isn't disturbing or red-flaggy at all, just a bit off-kilter, and fairy-like. I believe channeling her psychosis into her art has helped a ton. She seems to be coping with her condition very well and is tremendously kind and caring- one of the best humans I've ever met.

However, I recently saw a YouTube documentary about an unmedicated man suffering from severe schizophrenia, things like communicating with god, believing the CIA was after him, in and out of police stations and mental hospitals, stuff like that. I watched someone who was already pretty wacked out degrade even further until finally it ended with him living on the streets and being hit by a train- an apparent suicide.

I never want this to happen to my friend, ever. The thought of this absolute flower of a human being even possibly ending up like that shatters my heart to think about. I brought it up to her and asked her if she took anything for what she had, but she thanked me and assured me she was fine the way she was and didn't need any medication, that her depression had tapered off and she learned to live with her psychosis- even showed me some nice art she made based off a person she had hallucinated. Given all I know about her, she seems... fine. I want to believe her, and I guess I do. She looks fine, she has a good relationship, a side business, she's never violent or has outbursts of depression or anxiety, all of this of her own accord, unmedicated.

I know this was very long winded and I probably sound foolish with how I've interpreted a lot of this, but I suppose I only want to know one thing.

**Can schizophrenia be left untreated? Or will her condition gradually get worse as she gets older, independent of her coping mechanisms, no matter how fine she seems right now?**

I've of course left her alone about it. But I'm fucking tearing up, and I'm scared. If there's a chance things can go downhill for her, just let me know.

How do we address this with him in a non confrontational manner? I even have a video of him doing this which I'm thinking of showing to him so he understands his behavior and realizes that we aren't making this up.

The other day I needed to go to my prof's office hours to go over some ideas I had for my project. I was already dreading going to her office hours because my lack of prereq course knowledge would make her think that I wasn't cut out for the course. I looked at the clock and saw that there were 30 mins left in her office hours so I just got up without a thought to go talk with her. When I got up to her floor I saw another professor from a class that I had skipped 2 times that week so I panicked a little bit and turned the corner and BOOM her office was right there. I just walked in without a thought. Instant regret. I should've composed myself and got my thoughts before I entered, but I didn't. All my stress just unloaded on me. Recent breakup, interviews coming up, I'm stupid because I didn't come into this course with a solid knowledge of the basics, I'm not me (something along the lines of other beings controlling me but idk how to explain it), yada yada yada. I started panicking so bad in her office, and the fact that I was panicking only made me panic more. I was sweating, couldn't breathe, and couldn't speak in complete sentences. I just kept saying sorry to her and she said, ""it's okay, you're okay. I understand - it's that time of the semester."" What an angel. But that made me panic more. Who was I to be in this person's presence taking up their time? For what? God dammit. And I felt like I kept being mean to her. She'd talk about some departmental stuff (which I was actually really interested in) and when I talked I just switched back to staff about my project. Like what the fuck? FUCK. I'm so mad that I was an awkward, stupid, rude, timesucking demon to an absolute angel.

After 30 mins of studdering and not being able to breathe, I told her I was sorry for taking up her time and that I had schizophrenia (hoping it'd explain some of my actions there). The meeting was very helpful for me though because it set me on the right direction for my project. I thanked her and let her know that I'd start coming into office hours more often. Next time I go I'm going to make sure I have a much better foundational knowledge and specific questions I need to ask her.

And honestly, just writing this out stressed me out so I'm going to smoke now.
But quick sidenote I starting seeing a therapist again and I got rediagnosed as schizoaffective :) :). It's been 3 years since I was diagnosed with schizophrenia. Relatively short time, but sometimes I feel like I don't have much more time to live so it who knows!

I haven't seen them much since then because they moved around a lot. I didn't know them when they weren't medicated, but recently I've been seeing them at a local coffee shop popular for college students in my town. They usually give me a head nod of acknowledgement  because we do have a history though I haven't talked to them in years. I usually just see them briefly and then go along my business. 

Yesterday they confronted me publicly and told me to stop following them. They think I'm lying about being a college student (the café is for students only, they aren't a student but they are the same denomination of the Church that runs it)  and that I go there to stalk them. I don't ever talk to them, usually avoid it because It's awkward seeing old friends, I only see them there maybe once or twice a week, but it's a really busy spot with lots of regulars. They very publicly accused me of following them and lying about my real motives of going there everyday, which is to study. They were scared and also angry that I was lying to them. I think they made it public because they felt there was a safety in numbers if other people knew what I was supposedly doing. They accused me of trying to sleep with their bother who is around 7 years old. 

Before this interaction I haven't spoken to this individual in years. I frequent that café because it's a great study place and they have study rooms but I'm afraid of seeing them again. I don't want to be confronted again but I know they're just scared of being stalked, I'm just 100% not stalking them, and I don't want them to come up to me again and accuse me of sleeping with a 7 year old. Because of this, I am pretty sure they are still off their medication, so ultimate I don't want to scare them.

 Can someone give me some insight of how this individual may be feeling? I don't want them to approach me again so I decided to stop going to that location.  Oh yeah and just incase anyone was wondering I am not self diagnosing them, they told me they were schizophrenic in 2015 when they told me they were deciding to go off their medication.",1569038551.0

It took me a while, but I was able to stop weed and my delusions have shrunk, with the paranoia pretty much gone I am now realizing how boring by life actually is. Im not longer a detective within my own head. With the paranoid delusions, I felt like there was purpose to my life, to find out information about those plotting against me.

I have had auditory, visual and tactile hallucinations. I've had auditory hallucinations at night, and when they increased my seroquel dose, they pretty much went away. Only experienced visual hallucinations after smoking weed (I don't do that anymore), and tactile hallucinations happen from time to time.

I think I might be going crazy.. I’m seeing a doctor today.. 

So here’s a bit of background, question is at the bottom ; 


I don’t really talk much about my severe anxieties because I’m afraid they will lock me up. 

So I lie a lot to my previous doctors to avoid being locked away.. but I think I’m getting worse.

Im terrified of leaving my house, going to the movies, the mall public places.. it scares me, I am scared someone will kill me or hurt me. 

I’m scare if I leave my house I will get into an accident. 

I am convinced there is something out there trying to hurt me I’ve been in deadly car accidents and have had near death experiences

I do have other issues as well, I’m depressed, I don’t want to live some times. I get angry easily. 

But now I feel I’m just becoming worse. I think people are out to get me.. my boyfriend is only with me to torture me. 

No one talks to me, so I think they don’t like me. I have lots of friends on Facebook but no one ever talks to me, so I fee like they are only there to watch me and laugh at me and talk about me. 

When someone’s on the phone around me taking low I get angry because I know for sure they are talking about me


I can’t tell the difference between my dreams and reality some times either. Like I’ll dream something and think it actually happened, or that dream will replace my previous day. Sometimes I think that what actually happened was only a dream. It’s really confusing, and makes it hard for me to continue through my day. 

If I tell all of this to a doctor, and they think I have schizophrenia, are they going to lock me up? 

Because I don’t want to be locked away, it will only make it worse. And I’m so scare the doctors are going to put me in some drugs to make me a zombie and lock me up and I’ll never see anyone again.",1568950127.0

Called my psychiatric facility at 5:05 PM after I found out my pharmacy was still on back order and there are none at any of the other pharmacies.   


The person answering the phone told me it wasn't enough of an emergency to call the doctor on call, but is enough of an emergency for me to go to the ER or Crisis facility. I asked her if that made any sense. I explained the situation again (which might have been a little broken with how my brain is working) and how the doctor just needed to give authorization to the pharmacy to give me double half dosage. She insisted that it wasn't enough of an emergency, but due to the episode I am having I should go to the crisis center.   


This seems a little broken to me. Of course, in my state right now, I may not be seeing things clearly. Am I wrong in thinking they should have just called the doctor?  


Yes, I will be on the phone with them tomorrow morning at 9 am. Just feeling a bit foggy and paranoid. Trying to keep busy with some video games.

I get distracted very easily with everything. It takes me 3 times longer to finish anything it feels. Video games are my go to most of the time, but I have trouble even staying focused on them. I will be playing, and get the urge to check Twitter, then to check Reddit, then, oh right, I'm playing a game.   


It is like that with everything though. Having conversations with people, I am not fully focusing on the conversation. I am looking around at things going on around me, looking at the pictures on the walls, looking at just random things. It is one of the reasons why I am taking a break from therapy. My therapy sessions weren't being helpful, because I wasn't talking about anything for enough to really make a difference.   


Is there something that anyone does to help with their focus? Is there maybe a medication that I could ask about? Maybe that wouldn't be a good thing though. I'm already taking quite a few meds.",1568892996.0

I've always trumped it to her being her own person, but I recently noticed behavior that made me concerned she may have early on set dementia. She has lived alone a while now as her kids are grown. I haven't spent much time with her in years other than an hour here or there. My husband and kids and I moved in with her temporarily to get away from his family and get a home in a cheaper area. 

Her behavior now:
1.) She was looking for a job in Charlottesville (25 minutes from where we live). The job was at an elderly rehab facility. She stated they would start her ASAP or shortly after and they offered a program to get a CNA. I took her to the second ""interview"" to handle paperwork, etc. She came out and was down. She was confused and very sad. I asked what was wrong. She was in disbelief and very confused. She was saying things like ""I don't know what I was thinking"". She wanted to go sit down and have lunch. She was still very down and couldn't formulate words. She pulled out the contract. It was not an offer letter or employment contract. It was an agreement for nursing classes. She would go to class there three nights a week and could not miss one day or she would owe the money back. She obviously has to work as well, therefore could not commit that much time to this. I asked if they misled her and she said ""no, no. I don't know what I was thinking. They told me. I don't know"". 
2.) My son's birthday - she offered to purchase the pizza as her gift to him. She called me upstairs to give me her card. I went there and she was confused, but got up and said she was going to take care of the pizza. She grabbed her wallet then said ""what was I doing""? I didn't think much of this. I assumed she had just woke up. I reminded her. A moment later, she stopped again and looked at me confused and said ""what are you doing? what do you need?"" completely forgetting not only what she was doing, but that she called me. She had no idea why I was in her room standing in front of her. (This occurred in the evening.)
3.) Husband took her to the gym to see a trainer about her legs. (She is having serious problems with her legs. They are weak and she has difficulty walking. This just came to surface in the last year and is not improving. She is seeing a neurologist and has neuropathy. According to her, the doctor said on a scale of 1-10, her neuropathy is only a 3. She is seeing a psychiatrist. She is seeing an opthalmologist. She seems to be going blind, but denies the seriousness as she does The neuropathy. The trainer refused to see her as she almost fell over in session. They said she needed to do PT. The worker in the gym asked what her driver looked like and the color of the vehicle. Apparently whatever she told the trainer was not the description of the vehicle. Luckily, she asked my husband if he knew her. She said she didn't remember my husband drove her car and described his car. 
4.) Last week, she claimed her job (home for the elderly and disabled) asked her to work a double. She told me she said no. A few days later, she said she needed to go in a 3 for a double. I assumed it changed. She went in and came back ten minutes later and said she wasn't scheduled to work. She was confused and trumped it to bad scheduling and communication. The same happened today and she was texting with coworkers and supervisors. All week she had said they asked her to go in this Saturday at 3 for a double again. She said she told them no. Today, she said she was going to, but her supervisor text her and said ""you are not working a double Saturday. Go look at the schedule at the office."" I took here there and the first thing the worker said was ""What are you doing here?"". Seemed like they were used to her popping up. She went and spoke to the supervisor. She came back agitated which didn't make sense as her schedule did not change at all from the usual, however she told me last night she picked up other days and the supervisor told her that.
5.) Husband took her to an appointment last week at the eye doctor she sees regularly (clearly there's a problem) and waited four hours. She said the woman had labeled her as a no call, no show and they didn't know she was there, so she waited and waited and they saw her. Not sure I buy this. I think some confusion took place. Her appointment was probably on a different day.
6.) She is going back to that same gym tomorrow claiming she now has a physical therapist there after the supposed trainer said they wouldn't see her. She thought this appointment was yesterday, but called them and they told her it was tomorrow instead at 8:00 a.m.
7.) She was looking for a seasoning that was supposedly missing and supposedly found it. Then a week later, she was looking for a seasoning again.
8.) She asked me about a top to a dish that never had a top. I told her when we moved in that it was in the refrigerator with no top and had rice in it, uncovered.
9.) Her house is very messy and in some cases dirty.
10.) She has incontinence and had bowel movements and needs to urinate immediately after eating. She also overeats. Mostly at night. 11.) She misplaces something every day. Literally.
12.) She has never had a license yet has a car that she drives to and from work. She mentioned being in a couple of minor accidents when attempting to go on the highway. She drove into the ditch in one. 
13.) She ""left"" a job a couple of years ago, because she punched someone in the face. (Pretty sure she was fired.)

It seems something neurocognitive is happening. She doesn't realize the memory issues and impairment. She Trump's everything up to her legs as that's visual and noticeable. She is only 57. 

Now...for the confusing part...
She has hummed her entire life nonstop, she makes weird noises everyday. She constantly moans and grunts or says ""ohhhoooohhoo"" over and over. She will be talking then her voice will change into a high pitched, seemingly silly and child like voice. She will say ""yesss, yesss"" over and over in a sing song tone. She changed her voices at other times too, but this one is very repetitive. She will make outrageous noises when playing with my children and get them all rowled up, because they don't know what to make of it. All of this has happened from as long as I or her kids can remember.

I spoke to her daughter who I'm close with and she was also concerned about the memory, then even more so when we connected dots. She and I attempted to talk to one of her brother's, my friend's other son. He dismissed it all as her being exhausted from her job and claimed the legs would improve with PT and getting a new job would help the memory. He then said we need to find her a new job, preferably in Waynesboro and not Charlottesville. He lives in Charlottesville and Charlottesville is the largest city near us. He just doesn't want to drive her around since she is without a license or be bothered with her, yet, he recruited her into one of these Ponzi scheme selling fades with Amway. He got commission on her Joining and she's spending all her money on this nonsense and he has convinced her it's good.

I don't want to confront her as I've tried to hint the legs seem to be a symptom of something bigger and she always claims she just needs PT. Her daughter feels the same as me, but we also want to make sure she is safe as my husband and I will not be here forever to watch after her and all her kids are out of state except the son mentioned above.

I took the MMPI test two days ago and aparently scored off the charts on two of the categories. My consistency was good, indicating that I was not lying, but these two categories (I forget what they were called, something like Unusual Criteria) were 100/100, so higher than basically every single person of hundreds of thousands who take this test. My inpatient psychiatrist didn't know what to make of it.

Then today we had a meeting where she told me that I am a VASTLY unusual patient because a) my voices are the most troublesome thing for me (really, I'm the only one?) b) I tend to get slowly worse then rapidly better in the hospital (makes sense to me, the hospital is a triggering environment for me but once I get on the right meds I quickly feel better) and c) meds don't help me (simply not true. I've been helped by many meds and am currently being helped by the Invega and Abilify I'm on). 

It felt like an accusation, like I'm faking my schizophrenia. Right.. Like I come to the hospital for fun. She's also made comments before about how strange it is that my behavior and speech aren't particularly disorganized. 

Basically it came down to her saying that she was going to taper me off all my meds because they're not working (not perfectly, but they fucking ARE!!!) and then she didn't know what to do.

After some back and forth where I confirmed that she actually had no plan and no ideas, I requested to be discharged from the hospital because I am receiving no help here and I see no reason to believe that I will in the future either. I'm not going to live in a hospital bedroom forever for no reason while I receive zero treatment. 

I would be much better served and treated by my outpatient doctor, who still has hope and ideas for me, as well as being near my friends and family. 

She reluctantly agreed under the conditions that we wait a couple of days and conference call with my outpatient psych. I sincerely hope he agrees to this plan because I honestly think the alternative looks grim.

For a few years, I'd increasingly been getting psychosis outside of mood episodes, plus negative symptoms. I'm still trying to wrap my head around everything. 

Last week, my pdoc upped my Seroquel XR dose to 600 mg (from 450 mg) to try to knock out the psychosis I was having. Well, it's mostly worked, and the visual hallucinations and original delusions are mostly gone. My head is a lot more quiet than it’s been in years. 

Except...I was fine for a few days, but now I'm finding that I'm developing new delusions/paranoia about them being gone...specifically paranoia that the meds are erasing my brain, that it's all part of a grand plan to ""control"" my mind, that the medicine isn't medicine at all but a way to suppress the “messages” I get, general paranoia about conspiracy..... I'm really suspicious of the meds now. I should say, these all build on the delusions we were trying to get rid of because they are about similar themes, so I feel I’m going round and round in a scary circle.

I've been making some changes in my life lately, because things were causing me a lot of stress, so I decided to eliminate a lot of those things that were just causing episodes. Things like streaming on Twitch, which was a big part of my life, but I found that I was having more and more episodes while streaming, causing me to have to end early and abrupt.   


I also had to stop going to the therapist that I was going to, because she wasn't helping me at all, and to be honest, it was a wrong fit for me. She had no specialties with schizoaffective disorder, and would sometimes not really even understand why I felt certain ways about certain things. The final straw for me was her telling me to 'man up' about going out and meeting people. I'm still seeing a psychiatrist though, and have been taking my meds.   


I stopped streaming with the intents of creating YouTube videos, because I would be able to do them one my terms. When I would feel stable. Doing the voice work for the videos would probably only take an hour, which I can manage.   


The problem is that I haven't really been able to do anything. Most days I just sleep all day, which my family hates, and most nights I am sitting around playing video games or browsing Twitter or Reddit. I'm scared to sleep during the night, because when I wake up in the middle of the night I see shadow people and orbs bouncing around my room.   


I just feel that I am always just one inch from another episode. Tonight everything is fuzzy and static. I am trying to watch streams, play music, and play video games to try to keep my mind busy and drown out what is going on in my head. I told my psychiatrist this, he pretty much just told me that is just how it is sometimes. I've tried meditation, but, the voices won't let me. I feel that if I fight, they are going to fight back, and if I let them just happen, then that is bad too.   


I just feel so out of control lately. I get distracted very easily. I sleep so much. I am not doing anything with my life. I am not creating anything in any way. I know it is all just a slippery slope that I am getting myself in. I wish I could just stop it. I know I can't. I just keep hoping tomorrow will be a better day. I want to force myself to create again, just so I at least have a purpose. So I feel that I am doing something with my life.",1568812233.0

I was a tight women’s 12 when I started this and now I’m a really loose 12/ kinda tight 10. My waist went from 33 inches to 31.5 since aug 30th!

What do I eat? No refined carbs and no added sugars. They fuck with your body man. That’s about all the restrictions I have. The rest is just good, whole food. I aim for at least 3 servings of fruit/veg a day and lots of fibre.

What do I do for exercise? I’ve only started exercising over the last 12 days. I’ve done a few yoga classes, weighted yoga classes, barre classes, pilates. I’m introducing swimming this week, and boxing and circuit training next week. Right now I exercise about 10 hours a week, and I’m aiming for 18.

1. I live in an apartment in an inner-city area about two hours by public transport. I'm an office worker who works as a professional graphic designer for a large multinational as well as freelance. I am not really able to work all the time because I have a full-time job and two other part time jobs. In my free time, I like to spend more and more time on internet games and to keep my eyes on social media. My work schedule is pretty much like this: 1-6AM, 5-10PM, 1-6AM, 8PM. My daily schedule gives me more free time, because I can spend it on work when it suits me. I usually sleep between 9PM and 3AM, but I've seen people that spend 20-30 hours there.


2. My income is around $7k to $10k per year on my monthly expenses.


3. My expenses are a combination of rent, electricity, phone, food and internet. I don't really spend enough time on anything else these days.. I do enjoy the brief breaks wherein I have a little extra spending money. 

One of those spending money moments is when my son says ""Mom, I want to play football with mom,"" and I say ""That's cool. What do you want to do?"" He's just getting interested, so I take the kids aside, and I say, ""Let's just do it. We're not going on a shopping trip right now, let's just do it.""

Q: When did you start using marijuana?

A: I didn't do it too much. I just used it to light up a cigarette. I really didn't use weed with anyone, but I've been looking for ways to relax. I really believe it opens up the mind. I think weed has had a positive influence on my kids. I think it's been very beneficial to them, and I'm very glad they decided to let me use weed for something other than their parents' pot, rather than their parents' weed. But it hasn't led to anything bad. I've not gotten in trouble, I have not broken the law, I haven't done anything. I haven't done anything you understand, please my children do know what it takes to stay strong as well as fearful. It takes my own resolve you know",1568799879.0

We were getting worried because he would have these random outbursts or just talk to himself all day or at the television. He has zero social anymore. Since January, they had prescribed him Risperidone and Trazadone. He was only taking the meds up until around March then stopped. He kept saying it made him feel drowsy and depressed, like he had no drive to do anything. While he was on them, I could see a huge difference in his appearance and how he talks and expresses himself. He’s a lot more calm and he doesn’t just speak nonsense. It’s too bad he stopped because now he’s kinda the same as before.  The doctors assigned him to a physiatrist that he goes almost once every other week. I haven’t called up to see what they talk about. It’s been 3 months that he’s seeing them. The odd part is, he still doesn’t believe he has schizophrenia. He thinks it’s just sleep problems. I don’t know how to convince. It’s like he thinks I’m out to get him every time I bring it up to him. To make matters worse, my own parents are in complete denial as to how this could happen to him. They blame themselves, they blame the schools, they even blame his friends he used to hang with all the time. They are convinced that he was always like this, like he was always talking to himself, never had friends, and being a poor student. ALL OF THAT IS FALSE. My brother was the guy I looked up to. He was the guy who you play sports with all the time. The guy that all his classmates would say is funniest guy around. This shit doesn’t happen to just about anyone. It’s a rare disorder.

And have had some bad experiences with some medications. Before medication I had some weird days but my schizophrenia hadn’t developed yet. Then I went through all the typical onset symptoms with a full psychotic break. I have been on medication ever since my psychotic break. And before I found the right med combo I still had TVs talking to me and hallucinations 

I ended up doing what everyone warned me most schizophrenic people do. I found a med combo that almost erased my symptoms and then thought maybe I was over this illness or had never had it in the first place and that somehow the old medications I was on were causing my hallucinations. I made a choice to withhold my next shot of anti psychotics till I could see how I really was.

.....it went amazing...at first. I had lost the side effects to the shot. Things started coming back like I used to have. Like my sex life was normal again. I became so alert and happy. Even my husband was thinking maybe I didn’t need the meds

I started to get odd.... it started with paranoia of germs especially around the bathroom. I found myself unable to go into the bathroom all together and cleaned it at 3am. Which ok wasn’t normal but it wasn’t that bad either right. Well one day I realized people were cutting trees in my yard. (I latter learned that it was the power company clearing the lines so they didn’t get hurt in a storm or something) but at the time I was so scared to go outside. I called my husband almost ten times in a half hour. I had to go get my daughter from school but I was so scared they would yell at me. I don’t know why. He had to talk to me the whole time while I walked outside. That day I made a new shot appointment, but I didn’t think I actually needed it. I was more scared what people would do when they found out I hadn’t taken the shot. It was a week away and in that week I started to develop all these delusions about the devil and god. It didn’t get really bad till I got into a talk with my husband about how I was this all important going to change the world energy. He listened without saying a word. I don’t even know how long it went on for. Then he decided to call in sick for the last few days I had until my shot. I didn’t know if I was going to take the shot again. I felt this deep connection with the energy of the universe and I was so scared I would loose that. It felt....amazing. I ended up going to my appointment only because I was really scared of what people would say if I fully stopped my meds and I figured if the universe had a message to get to me it would be harder with the meds sure but the universe would find a way. 

My husband came with me and held my hand the whole way. After I got it he just hugged me so tightly I didn’t understand why he seemed so resigned. When I take my shot I get very sick for a few days after and need to sleep it off. He got me back home and in bed. After about a week we started talking about the things I did off medication. I started to accept a truth that my husband already had. I have a serious mental illness and I will be on medication for the rest of my life. The medication changes the way I have to live my life because of side effects. But I need them to be able to stay in this reality. 

I’m thankful for the fact that it was only about 3 weeks off meds. I didn’t destroy anything in my life and my husband didn’t have to step in for me to accept I was going to take another shot. But I feel like I have lost the person I was before I was ever dealing with having a mental illness. Before this experience I always thought it was just a part of me I would pick back up. I don’t know who I am anymore or what’s real. It turns out I really am schizophrenic",1568705081.0

The whole family, myself included, was in denial of that diagnosis for a long time. I think I'm finally on board. 

Do y'all have any tips for communicating, connecting, or otherwise spending time with lil bro? I love him, and we bond over music, but conversations are pretty much impossible. Very little of what he says makes sense or is a coherent thought, and he doesn't talk that much to begin with. As far as I'm aware he doesn't stick to his medication, and is on and off illegal drugs (more off than on lately, so I'm proud of him for that). 

He also will randomly tear up, get really sad, or just non compliant. I want to take him out for meals and stuff but he'll get into strange conversations with strangers and make them uncomfortable. It pisses me off, just play along, he's not going to hurt you. But I can't really blame them when even I can't hold a conversation with him.

So naturally, I sent a text to her sister (only contact I have of hers because the girl cut off the rest of her family because they wanted her to get help) and told her about it (btw I had no idea at the time she was a paranoid schizophrenic not on medication and in denial). And her sister and family knowingly let her move on her own without giving any heads up to me or other roommates about it and we were completely blindsided by it. Her sister originally was very helpful and was like I'll call her doctor and help to get her admitted, now fast forward to 3 days later (roommate is still talking to herself) because the sister was like we need the social worker to come in and see her first, so I waited and took time off from work and class to be here. And later when I questioned the sister on what is happening because I've been here all day she has been giving me the run around all day and finally, I told her I need to know what's going on so I can prepare for it. So she goes and makes it seem like I'm bugging her and making this out to be a bigger deal than it is and tells me, ""I don't have to do this you know"".

So makes us feel super shitty about being concerned about our safety and well-being as well as the new roommates about asking her to help with her sister who at night (2-3am) talks to herself about souls, demons and how some people are demons corrupting regular souls.

When my spouse last spoke to her she, spontaneously, told him that if I'm experiencing psychosis at all, in any small amount, they should leave me. They told her that BP often involves psychosis, and they're fine, and they have no intention of leaving me. They're a very honest and open person, and they're very loving. I do believe they're not going to leave me. 

This isn't the first time she's tried to get them to leave me. She asked them for years after I came out as trans when, not if but **when**, they planned to leave me? And encouraged them not to feel guilty for doing so. When she said this at the time I laughed. And, while I deeply trust my spouse (even when I'm psychotic and out of my mind with delusions I trust them) there's something about this time that has deeply shaken me. I think I really do wonder if it would be better for them? And I wonder if my presence in their life is inherently harmful to them. I wonder if she's right. 

I'm doing everything I can to stay on top of my treatment plan. I take my meds, and modulate my dose depending on the presence of additional symptoms.

My schizophrenia resolves all around my thoughts being heard by others. I never took drugs, it simply started one day. I experience this problem for 9 years now and currently a bad phase is incoming.When a psychotic phase starts i begin to hear voices. I hear them mostly in other sounds. So if someone speaks too far away from me or outside my line of sight i hear them talking about me. When i'm showering i hear voices coming from the running water or in the music i'm listening to. These voices comment negatively on my every move and try to drive me insane with jedi mindtricks. My paranoid delusion tells me it's my neighbors who do this to me, but i don't believe it. I just can't stop the feeling that this is happening and sometimes i lose insight for a few minutes.With the voices intrusive thoughts are happening. They interact with each other and form a downwards spiral that dragged me down a few times and i went off the deep end.

These intrusive thoughts are mostly really bad stuff about everyone who is around me and i fear that i speak every thought out loud, especially my intrusive thoughts. That brings more fears with it. I fear my neighbor will kill me, even if i can't control these thoughts and i mean no harm. I never have seen this guy or know him in any way. My intrusive thoughts include harsh insults, sexual stuff and anything that could hurt me in any way. It's like my brain is suicidal and wants to see me dead.I barely can go outside because this stuff gets so bad and i fear if i meet the wrong person that he could hurt me because of these thoughts.They just happen like a sneeze and the voices react every time and make it even worse. It's a horrible experience when you go outside and everyone is talking about you and these thoughts get loud and out of hand. I just hope people would understand that i don't mean them and i explain so much stuff about it inside my head for them, but they will never hear it. 

Sometimes i hear these thoughts in my environment and i'm not sure if i think them myself. I fear that because of these thoughts my neighbors are out to hurt me and want to drive me insane or make that i leave. Recently loud noises happen every time i lie down on my bed and i think it's them trying to stop me from sleeping.I really don't want this all getting out of hand and i do my best to fight it, but i had no real success with it. I don't really want to bother anyone, i don't care about my neighbors or random people on the street, but these intrusive thoughts want to hurt me every time.When i went to a psychiatric hospital last December i noticed that really no one seemed to know this stuff is going on and  that every time i closed the door of my room i heard anyone on the hallway talking about me. When i opened it they stopped to do that. I asked many people in person if i said anything weird and that they should tell me when i do. No one heard anything and i don't think everyone was keeping that from me. My voices want to gaslight me and drive me crazy and sometimes they get what they want. I really don't know what would help beside medication that never worked for long to stop it. I try to ignore this whole thing happening, but that too only works for so long.

964,Introducing Myself; Question About Recent Symptoms,3,d53ppy,schizophrenia,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/d53ppy/introducing_myself_question_about_recent_symptoms/,7,"Hello, everyone. It's taken me ages to actually join reddit. I've been dealing with various little things for years. I was diagnosed with I guess what you'd call nowadays Mayor Depressive Disorder? Or chronic? Idk. This was around...age 14 or 15, I'd like to say. It was a rollercoaster from here on out. I'd go to the teen's psychiatric center, go to group therapy, go home, take my medicine, feel better for a little while, feel terrible afterwards. Y'all have heard this a thousand times. 

Later on, I stopped taking psych meds all together. I decided I didn't want to ""feel like a zombie"" anymore, my exact words. So I stopped. Soon after all my symptoms got worse. My imsomnia worsened and I was losing it. I hadn't been completely suicidal just yet, but when I was 16-17 that all changed. My first suicide attempt was at 16, at a high school friend's party. I won't go into details because I know they can be quite triggering.

I had come out soon after graduating. My conservative, boricua parents weren't too keen on having a queer kid so things only got worse at home. Endless war. I started getting extremely volatile. Seeing shadow people. I wouldn't sleep for days. Hearing different voices that I still hear to this day. I started to think everyone was out to get me and that everyone else read my thoughts. Intrusive thoughts felt more and more violent, strange and alien. Some nights I just couldn't come home due to fear of my parents. Fear of my room and all the times I self-harmed in there, all the sprits I felt lived in there, etc. 

Nowadays, I live with my fiancee. We're planning on moving to either NYC or Chicago in the near future. These things haven't gone away, tbh. Improving my life and going to study abroad helped a lot. I now live in an accepting space with my girlfriend. But I've been getting extremely paranoid lately. Literally feeling like people are going to kill me. People that I know and love...feeling like they're going to poison me or push me down stairs. The shadow people have also come back. Lots of things moving in my peripheral vision. Sometimes just literal tall human-like figures walking in front of me, hovering over me, etc. I hear the voices of friends whom I've never heard shout at me, telling me to off myself or to harm others. I also feel a burning sensation coarsing through my body, most intensely my back, shoulders and face. I'm resilient, I don't give in to commands. All I do is twitch and tell my fiancee ""hey, i'm not really doing too good.."" So idk, i'm just in an odd spot and not sure what to make of what I'm feeling. Not on any psych medication. I was perscribed Risperidone when I talked to my doctor about the burning sensation, muscle twitches and shadow people, but I never started cuz Idk I don't really feel like these symptoms warrant an anti-psychotic. I don't feel like I have psychosis. My grandma has paranoid schizophrenia but she's my only relative who has it.

TL;DR: Hi, new to Reddit. Rollercoaster of a life with a major depressive disorder diagnosis but lately been feeling worse and not knowing what it is I'm feeling. Not on any psych meds, currently.

I'm pretty ignorant when it comes to these issues, especially since it's been years since I've had psychiatric treatment of any kind.

968,Tapering off of antipsychotic drugs.,2,d51070,schizophrenia,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/d51070/tapering_off_of_antipsychotic_drugs/,5,"So from about May to now, I have been tapering off antipsychotic drugs. My doctor was on board with it before, but because of being in college I don't have a doctor to support me now although I have a therapist and will try to find a doc. Basically I was on 234 mg/3 weeks of Invega Sustenna (equivelant to 4 mg risperidone) in May. I did a quick drop of 25% and that was pretty much fine, but once I went down to 156 mg, equivelant to 3 mg of risperidone, it was kind of rough and I was having returning symptoms. But after about one or months, once August came, my body totally adjusted and now the 3 mg dose of risperidone, which I switched to because it is easier to access than the injection and easier to taper, works fine, better than the 4 mg dose in fact.

A couple weeks back I attempted to go down straight to 2 mg, and it wasn't completely unmanageable, but it was just a little bit too rough considering my high demands on me as a student. So in the past 24 hours I have gone down 0.5 to 2.5. The peer-written guides I've seen to taper down all recommend something like 10-25% drop from the original dose every 2-4 weeks, with once reaching the half point, a 10-25% drop of the PREVIOUS month's dose because of the fact that your body has adjusted to the previous dose and it is actually an incredibly drastic drop to continue doing it from the original dose, and because of the difficulty with getting past the very reduced stages of dosing, with high withdrawals.

So basically, no I don't have a doctor, I might try to get one, but no I absolutely don't need one because the majority of doctors are not even trained to take patients OFF meds, and all the information I need has been compiled by peers in withdrawal.theinnercompass.org.

If it is too rough, I will slow down. I'm being careful about it. But can I hear from you guys your experience of slowly tapering off meds, if you have had such an experience, or any recommendations for how to deal with any withdrawal symptoms that may come up while being in school.

And please do not tell me by doing this I will be DoOmEd for the rest of my life and I should just take meds forever and ever until the metabolic symptoms or dementia from it kill me and that I should just listen to a psychiatrist and take whatever pills they want me to. Basically I'm asking you to respect my personal agency to have the freedom of choice as to what drugs I consume and are chemically dependent on.

TL;DR - my brother is a 20 year old schizophrenic who is threatening my family and we fear he may become violent. Looking for any experience or advice. 

Backstory: 

He’s a 20 year old male living at home with my parents in TX (I’m his 27 year old sister living in NY) and he had a psychotic episode about 6 months ago. 

He took a knife to my parents furniture, was thrown in jail, institutionalized for 2 weeks and diagnosed as “a possible schizophrenic”. They gave him anti-psychotic medication, but he didn’t stay on it for long. 

He’s confessed to auditory and visual hallucinations, and his desire to kill - but refuses to seek counseling or leave his room at all, other than to eat or walk the dogs. 

Fast-forward to last night. 

My parents have previously stated that he has his good days, and his bad. Last night was bad, and my parents feared for their life, so they called the police at 11 pm. 

An officer came to the house, spoke to my brother who repeatedly told him to “Get the fuck out of my house” ... then pulled a knife out on him. 

The officer said “hey son, please put the knife down, I want to go home to my kids tonight”  and my brother wouldn’t comply until the officer left his room. 

The officer left the home, and did not place my brother under arrest, nor did he, or my parents press charges against my brother. 


My parents now fear for their lives, believe he may have a firearm, and don’t want to provoke him by kicking him out. They say things like  “he might even be the next mass murderer” or  “if anything happens to us, just know it was your brother”.  

They’ve spoken to countless attorneys who have stated that there is nothing they can do, other than to continue calling the authorities. 

They are frustrated, and feel like my bother controls the house. My stepmom is only home on weekends for work - and my dad is there full time, as he is retired. 

I don’t know who to reach out to at this point, since they’ve contact the authorities multiple times and it seems like nothing gets done. They don’t want to provoke him anymore by kicking him out for fear of their own lives. 

I’m hoping someone on here has had similar experiences and can offer some advice.

986,I'm so fucking tired of people using my illness to exemplify some greater societal trend or psychological theory,21,d4lpgf,schizophrenia,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/d4lpgf/im_so_fucking_tired_of_people_using_my_illness_to/,10,"schizophrenia is a chronic condition caused by brain abnormalities and dysfunction

it isn't something that capitalism or social illness or underlying psychological truth is responsible for (looking at your post-modernists)

even the supposedly great theorists and psychologists seem to have absolutely no idea or conception of what schizophrenia is or what our experiences are

just say things are disconnected or absurd or disorganized. no need to drag us into it.

>[""In the 1960s and 1970s, radical theory and politics (Laing, Foucault, Deleuze and Guattari, etc.) coalesced around extreme mental conditions such as schizophrenia, arguing, for instance, that madness was not a natural, but a political, category.""](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/842089-capitalist-realism-insists-on-treating-mental-health-as-if-it)

many of the post modernists focused on schizophrenia specifically, not just mental illness generally.

>[""This chapter is specifically concerned with the major theoretical works identifying the figure of ‘the schizophrenic’ as representative or typical of the postmodern subject. Although this argument is advanced in an array of different contexts, across a range of disciplines, my analysis concentrates on key texts by Jean Baudrillard, Fredric Jameson, David Harvey, Mark Currie, John Johnston, and Steven Frosh. If, as Robert Barrett suggests, ‘People categorized as “schizophrenic” have long been entrusted with this duty of symbolizing society, its structural elements, its definition of personhood, its contradictions [and] its paradoxes’ (1998c, p. 484), what is distinctive about these theorists’ claim that schizophrenia can be used, however (il)legitimately, to interpret specific aspects of postmodernity?""](https://m.oxfordmedicine.com/mobile/view/10.1093/med/9780199583959.001.0001/med-9780199583959-chapter-006)

the thing that really sucks is that much of post modern philosophy is very compelling to me. generally their critiques of culture and capitalism are useful and insightful. they just wanted so badly for their framework for understanding the modern world to be directly applicable to specific individuals and exemplified in the world that they used anything they could to claim this was so. often it fell upon the mentally ill, most commonly schizophrenics. it just sucks that it wasn't enough for them to have a good critique of the modern world, they had to go and equate social illness with the personal sickness of many individuals.

I think I'm much more exposed to this being a political science major with a focus on philosophy but these narratives were very influential not just in the field of philosophy or sociology but in psychology too. we are still seeing these ideas float around in modern psychiatry.

what triggered this little bout of anger and discontent and hurt one of my philosophy professors teaching these theories and nervously looking at me every so often. I believe he knew that this was untrue and inapplicable and probably would even if he didn't have a particular disdain for the post-modernists. it just hurt.",1568589174.0
