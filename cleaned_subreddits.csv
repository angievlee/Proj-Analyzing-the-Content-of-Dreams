0,Just dreamt of the end of the world,Dreams,"I just woke from an insanely realistic dream about the end of the world, and I wanted to share it while it’s still fresh. It didn’t involve me but was more like watching a movie, which was odd to me also.

It started at a Fourth of July parade in small town, USA (didn’t recognize the street, just was a generic small town Main Street similar to my own). As the parade was going by, these mutant/zombie creatures came and started attacking. In my dream they were referred to as zombies, but they weren’t the typical zombies most picture. They were regular people, who were changed by some chemical/pollution issue-it wasn’t explained much, just that a common product had this chemical that caused it so it was worldwide-and would cause them to develop these tumors on their faces, but otherwise they looked normal. They also were super fast and strong, and would just kill whoever was in their path, but were very hard to kill themselves.

So the zombies descend on the parade, just grabbing people and ripping them apart as everyone scatters. A group of 12 people run and hide in a neighbors bunker, the neighbor is a scientist who had predicted an extinction level event was coming, and was prepared. He  worked for the government, and shared they had nuclear bombs stationed around the world to wipe the population if it came to it. He just had to get to his building downtown in the city to set them off. He said there was also a rocket there they could all fit in to take them off of earth to avoid the destruction.

The neighbors agreed to help him in exchange for seats on the rocket, and they headed out. There were some random scenes of different people in the group trying to drive, getting attacked, and basically being picked off one by one. There’s four that get to the building, the scientist, his adult son, and two women from the neighborhood. They needed to take this elevator down into the earth, but the zombies were getting stronger/faster/smarter, plus the military was setting off bombs of their own, and the women both ended up sacrificing themselves to help the scientist and his son escape.

Eventually, the son sacrificed himself, although the scientist was against it, but the son had trapped him in the elevator. The scientist makes it down to set off the bombs, and you see him take off while watching the earth explode all over into mushroom clouds.

Then it’s back to small town, USA, the parade, and everything looks the same. The scientist is walking and runs into the two women, who remember everything with the zombies, and ask him what happened after they died. The scientist pulls out a sketchbook, and shows the earth for the past millions of years, going through the same rebuilding process-dinosaurs, first man, everything the same. He was frozen on the rocket, but would unfreeze to check on earth, and draw what he saw. History went exactly the same, leading up to that point at the parade, and the women get worried and ask if the earth just keeps going through this continuous loop of building, destruction, and rebuilding? Then they start hearing the screams...

That’s when I woke to my alarm, it was so real I had to write it down. There were some smaller character stories involved too, like the son had a drug problem but chose to help his dad over drugs he found, etc, so it was really detailed, like a movie. I did watch American Horror Story Apocalypse a few weeks ago, which I think added to some of the detail (like the zombies), but the story was different. Otherwise I can’t think of anything that might’ve influenced the dream or story. I think the details and time progression are what was weird to me, my dreams are usually all over the place. I welcome any thoughts anyone has, thanks!

TLDR:  I had a realistic, movie like dream of a zombie attack on the world, and the journey of a scientist and his neighbors to nuke the planet. History then repeats and they end up back in the same place and time.",0,dreamt end world woke insanely realistic dream end world wanted share still fresh involve like watching movie odd also started fourth july parade small town usa recognize street generic small town main street similar parade going mutant zombie creature came started attacking dream referred zombie typical zombie picture regular people changed chemical pollution issue explained much common product chemical caused worldwide would cause develop tumor face otherwise looked normal also super fast strong would kill whoever path hard kill zombie descend parade grabbing people ripping apart everyone scatter group people run hide neighbor bunker neighbor scientist predicted extinction level event coming prepared worked government shared nuclear bomb stationed around world wipe population came get building downtown city set said also rocket could fit take earth avoid destruction neighbor agreed help exchange seat rocket headed random scene different people group trying drive getting attacked basically picked one one four get building scientist adult son two woman neighborhood needed take elevator earth zombie getting stronger faster smarter plus military setting bomb woman ended sacrificing help scientist son escape eventually son sacrificed although scientist son trapped elevator scientist make set bomb see take watching earth explode mushroom cloud back small town usa parade everything look scientist walking run two woman remember everything zombie ask happened died scientist pull sketchbook show earth past million year going rebuilding process dinosaur first man everything frozen rocket would unfreeze check earth draw saw history went exactly leading point parade woman get worried ask earth keep going continuous loop building destruction rebuilding start hearing scream woke alarm real write smaller character story involved like son drug problem chose help dad drug found etc really detailed like movie watch american horror story apocalypse week ago think added detail like zombie story different otherwise think anything might influenced dream story think detail time progression weird dream usually place welcome thought anyone thanks tldr realistic movie like dream zombie attack world journey scientist neighbor nuke planet history repeat end back place time

3,Violating the nightmare,Dreams,"Well uh.. where to begin...

I found this sub through google in search for answers for the nightmare i had, or if i even can call it nightmare anymore.

The dream was like any normal person would have, dreaming of a walk in the city, driving your dream car or being the superhero. Mine was simple, a normal walk in the park that i usually would visit when i was young, then it smudged into me walking into the apartment complex entrance - i checked the postbox if postman dropped any letters and then began to walk towards the elevator. The elevator was close the a backdoor entrance which was en-glassed and was about 5 steps away. But then it became all dark and gloomy, and out of nowhere, there was a humanoid shape behind the glass, i could feel the panic arise like, the unshakable feeling of fear, i begun to run to the opposite way of the backdoor but then - from out of nowhere those emotions disappeared - and i saw myself running to the backdoor - forcefully opening it open - grabbing the humanoid shadow(?) and started to rip its clothes off (?) - like i was shaken up of what i was doing - like i had no control whatsoever, as if i was watching a movie. When i(?) ripped off its clothes i started to lick the body of the shadow furiously, making my way to its face (even if it had a face) and started to french kiss it, and next thing i see is that i was chasing that shadow  By that time that world started to fade and i woke up quickly, jumped out of my bed and just stared into my empty room as to confirm that i was indeed at home. I felt so disgusted, the real emotions were just ... it was utter disgusting of what i did to that shadow.

I tried research this type of dream in the google, but with no success, so i am here and writing this -  trying to find and explanation to this type of dream, or nightmare.",0,violating nightmare well uh begin found sub google search answer nightmare even call nightmare anymore dream like normal person would dreaming walk city driving dream car superhero mine simple normal walk park usually would visit young smudged walking apartment complex entrance checked postbox postman dropped letter began walk towards elevator elevator close backdoor entrance en glassed step away became dark gloomy nowhere humanoid shape behind glass could feel panic arise like unshakable feeling fear begun run opposite way backdoor nowhere emotion disappeared saw running backdoor forcefully opening open grabbing humanoid shadow started rip clothes like shaken like control whatsoever watching movie ripped clothes started lick body shadow furiously making way face even face started french kiss next thing see chasing shadow time world started fade woke quickly jumped bed stared empty room confirm indeed home felt disgusted real emotion utter disgusting shadow tried research type dream google success writing trying find explanation type dream nightmare

5,"Zombies, bathrooms and my son (I don't have kids in real life)...",Dreams,"I was running around a city in shambles, looking for a place to hide from these intelligent man-eating zombies. Only place I found was a dirty bathroom tucked away in an ally. I rushed in and locked the door but there was a zombie outside the door asking if anyone was in there and pounding on the door. I was scared he'd break the door down if I made a sound so I quetly unpacked the overnight bag I had with me and prepared to spend the night in the bathroom.

I started to cry and a couple hours passed, then all the sudden the door opened and I was terrified but a little boy walked in. He was my son and he said ""mommy you never came home so I told them you were in here."" Initially I thought ""why the hell would you do that?"" But as it turned out, the man outside the bathroom door all night was a human and had been fighting off zombies to protect whoever was in the bathroom. Then I woke up.

6,"I dreamt of winter, it was creepy and lonely and too real to be a dream.",Dreams,"I wasn't home, I was somewhere I didn't know. It was snowing a lot, and in the news, they were warning people not to go outside. They were saying that when it snows, people start to get overwhelmed by loneliness and they wander off into the woods and end up hanging themselves using their own scarfs and they’ve already found bodies. When I heard that, I could suddenly see them.. like I already knew how they looked like, they were everywhere.. just people being hung from their scarfs on these empty trees. It was so fucking many people, as far as the eye can see, just people wearing winter coats and boots and hanging from trees by their scarfs. The snow was everywhere and there was fog all around them and I remember thinking ""please just ignore it, ignore it, ignore them"" but the image of them is so vivid even if I'm awake right now, I can see them and they all looked so.. emotionless (?) .. like this was normal and expected and they looked like they were sick, there was so much of them, just hung around every tree.

Then, I was suddenly in front of this old box tv, and this weirdly happy/optimistic news guy was on, he was walking backwards and bumped into something. A shit load of snow started falling on him and he kept saying ""it’s ok, don’t get engulfed by the fog, don’t panic, don’t follow the fog"" but I was already in a pond with a girl and there was a lot of fog and she was trying to get to the woods (they looked so empty, the trees where dead and they were FULL of fog and it was  so cold and grey) but because it was foggy there I didn’t wanna follow her but I didn’t want her to end up killing herself so I kept trying to pull her away. I could see her walking towards it but I couldn’t do anything and started thinking about what will happen to her. I started imagining her being hung by her scarf and I just started feeling so like.. bad and alone and panicked and I didn’t know what to do, but the place was so big and white and I was like.. so lost? I didn’t know where to go, I just kept thinking I didn’t want her to leave. 

Suddenly, I could remember the guy saying to not follow the fog but I was like.. fuck, I don't know WHAT ELSE to do, so I just .. started getting courage (or telling myself to) and I was saying ""its ok, I won’t die like them, it’s ok, I just need to get her and leave"", but I was crying while saying it because I couldn't see her around and I literally was so fucking alone and it was so scary . I vaguely remember trying to text my best friend but her chat was archived for some reason and I just started crying more cause I was thinking ""she won’t answer anyway, she won’t see it soon enough"" and then out of nowhere, I was like ""this is a dream, it’s a dream"" but .. I wasn't awake? I was still in the dream but it was like, I was conscious somehow? it wasn’t like I was in a dream anymore it was.. so real, like my brain was telling me to wake up but even when I woke up in the dream I was still stuck in that state of like panic and heavy because I was still there, I was stuck there. There was no escaping it, I was conscious yet I was there still and I started believing that it was real. I was in a pond, in the middle of snow, the fog was creeping in, I was gonna die, I will end up hanging myself by my scarf like everyone else and there was no one around to even say goodbye to, there was no one.. but then when I ACTUALLY woke up I was feeling.. so jumpy and already on the verge of tears and I kinda still am when I think of it because .. for some reason that feeling in the dream is  still stuck like it’s not like I was following the fog like them but it still surrounded me. I couldn't move or run, it was so empty. Even after I woke up, it took an hour for me to understand that THIS is real life, that that was just a dream, that nothing is going to get me, that I was dreaming only and now I am awake. 

and .. I don't know.. the feeling of being stuck in that pond, knowing the fog will inevitably engulf me, and I am alone and I know the one person who would care won’t even answer, and I just can’t even yell.. I didn't know what’s making people hang themselves but it’ll do it to me too and I can’t stop it and I can’t see anyone around me, no one was there AT ALL there was no one it was just me and I couldn’t even cry cause I didn’t even know what was out there that could like.. find me and get me. I didn't know what was in the fog that was making people kill themselves and I just felt like I had to keep quiet and shut up but I just felt so panicked and empty.. I couldn’t run or cry or leave or feel anything, I was just in the middle of the fog alone knowing it’ll kill me and I don’t even have anyone around me to say goodbye to.. it was literally one of the worst feelings I've ever felt. Saying loneliness makes it sound too mundane and normal, it was a lot worst. I still feel it when I think about the dream... I don't understand what's in my brain that made me come up with this.. I hate it so much but I am writing it here because I had to get it out.. There is no way for me to explain that feeling I felt right before I woke up, but it was worse than loneliness.. it was a lot worse.",0,dreamt winter creepy lonely real dream home somewhere know snowing lot news warning people go outside saying snow people start get overwhelmed loneliness wander wood end hanging using scarf already found body heard could suddenly see like already knew looked like everywhere people hung scarf empty tree fucking many people far eye see people wearing winter coat boot hanging tree scarf snow everywhere fog around remember thinking please ignore ignore ignore image vivid even awake right see looked emotionless like normal expected looked like sick much hung around every tree suddenly front old box tv weirdly happy optimistic news guy walking backwards bumped something shit load snow started falling kept saying ok get engulfed fog panic follow fog already pond girl lot fog trying get wood looked empty tree dead full fog cold grey foggy wanna follow want end killing kept trying pull away could see walking towards anything started thinking happen started imagining hung scarf started feeling like bad alone panicked know place big white like lost know go kept thinking want leave suddenly could remember guy saying follow fog like fuck know else started getting courage telling saying ok die like ok need get leave cry saying see around literally fucking alone scary vaguely remember trying text best friend chat archived reason started cry cause thinking answer anyway see soon enough nowhere like dream dream awake still dream like conscious somehow like dream anymore real like brain telling wake even woke dream still stuck state like panic heavy still stuck escaping conscious yet still started believing real pond middle snow fog creeping gonna die end hanging scarf like everyone else one around even say goodbye one actually woke feeling jumpy already verge tear kinda still think reason feeling dream still stuck like like following fog like still surrounded move run empty even woke took hour understand real life dream nothing going get dreaming awake know feeling stuck pond knowing fog inevitably engulf alone know one person would care even answer even yell know making people hang stop see anyone around one one even cry cause even know could like find get know fog making people kill felt like keep quiet shut felt panicked empty run cry leave feel anything middle fog alone knowing kill even anyone around say goodbye literally one worst feeling ever felt saying loneliness make sound mundane normal lot worst still feel think dream understand brain made come hate much writing get way explain feeling felt right woke worse loneliness lot worse
7,A nightmare I had about a mirror,Dreams,"So this is my first time posting, but I had this dream over a year ago. It, along with at least one other I had, are extremely vivid to me, even after all this time. It still feels very clear to me and I was very unnerved at the time. 

So it starts with me at this warehouse. I was there applying for a job. Irl around this time I was between jobs and alot of the jobs I did were temp work that didnt pay too well. I'm sitting at a desk filling out paperwork for the hiring process and someone asks me to come with him. They take me into an elevator with a few other guys. I realized now that they had guns but also they were all dressed nice. Suits and ties, bussiness attire. So I had this feeling that this was a ""haha, we cought you Mr bond"" moment.

So at the top of the elevator there was a room with no windows. It was a bunch of bussiness men sitting around on the floor. In the middle of the room was this big area full of pebbles and river rocks. Everyone was sitting around on the floor kinda like you see in Japan at some meals? At the end of the room was a tall thin mirror, that was more like a window to another place. They made me sit down and then I looked through the mirror.

Everything on the other side was black and white and grayed out. The mirror was at the bottom of this huge man made ditch. The ground was rocks, not just little pebbles but lots of jagged rocks. And the with of the ditch was... I wanna say 50 feet across? But I could see it go on for a long long time. I don't know how far it reached. The walls on either side looked like smooth stone. They weren't going up at a 90 degree angle, but it was close. At the top there was a bunch of people on either side. I couldn't see their clothes or their faces, but they made a lot of noise. Half of them were cheering while thr others were wailing and crying. I knew that this was either a long time ago or in another place with less technology. Like Aztec era.

Down in the ditch, I saw three... Gods? One looked like a huge baby, but with the face of an ugly old man. There was another that was.... All legs. It was this huge mass of human legs. And the baby one picked it up and started to eat it. I remember that I hated the noise, all crunch. I had the feeling that it was made or existed because the other one liked eating bones. And this was the way to get the most bones for it to devour.

The final one was by far the scariest to me. I remember ot barely moved. It stood in the center of my vision. It looked like a 14 foot tall man. He was completely naked with big genitals. His face looked like a Chinese lion statues face. Big unblinking eyes, two large curved teeth from his lower jaw and a permanant scowl. I remember a woman got thrown into the ditch and landed dead at his feet. He lifted her up and bit into her side. Blood ran down his body and streamed through the rocks in the ditch. The blood was the only thing of color in that gray place. I watched the blood snake its way through the rocks and pass from the mirror into my world. It streamed through the pebbles and the bussiness men all cupped their hands in the blood and brought it up to drink it. I didn't drink any, but I remember looking from them drinking the blood back to him and saw him stareing me right in the eyes.


And then I woke up. I can't explain how vivid this remains in what must be a year and a half later. I was super bugged out at the time. When I woke up there was a part of me that KNEW that that thing either had existed once or did exist, Somewhere.",0,nightmare mirror first time posting dream year ago along least one extremely vivid even time still feel clear unnerved time start warehouse applying job irl around time job alot job temp work didnt pay well sitting desk filling paperwork hiring process someone asks come take elevator guy realized gun also dressed nice suit tie bussiness attire feeling haha cought mr bond moment top elevator room window bunch bussiness men sitting around floor middle room big area full pebble river rock everyone sitting around floor kinda like see japan meal end room tall thin mirror like window another place made sit looked mirror everything side black white grayed mirror bottom huge man made ditch ground rock little pebble lot jagged rock ditch wanna say foot across could see go long long time know far reached wall either side looked like smooth stone going degree angle close top bunch people either side see clothes face made lot noise half cheering thr others wailing cry knew either long time ago another place le technology like aztec era ditch saw three god one looked like huge baby face ugly old man another leg huge mass human leg baby one picked started eat remember hated noise crunch feeling made existed one liked eating bone way get bone devour final one far scariest remember ot barely moved stood center vision looked like foot tall man completely naked big genitals face looked like chinese lion statue face big unblinking eye two large curved teeth lower jaw permanant scowl remember woman got thrown ditch landed dead foot lifted bit side blood ran body streamed rock ditch blood thing color gray place watched blood snake way rock pas mirror world streamed pebble bussiness men cupped hand blood brought drink drink remember looking drinking blood back saw stareing right eye woke explain vivid remains must year half later super bugged time woke part knew thing either existed exist somewhere

9,Negative Dream About Buddha Statues,Dreams,"Hey all,

I usually look up dreams on my own but due to the nature of this dream was hoping for some input.

I dreamt that I was being attacked by Buddha Statues everywhere I went. Each location would have at least one Buddha Statue that would wake up and attack me. I was not all that scared really but was trying to defend myself.

In my dream I said that someone had cursed them. There was also a plumbing leak in my kitchen I believe.

.............

My thoughts are:

1) I could feel overwhelmed by other people as all people are potential Buddhas, coming to me for help or advice. I may feel insecure about people looking up to me.

2) I read somewhere  that it denotes a lose of hope and a need to change my perspective. It can also mean various insecurities. I must agree as I have been having very negative emotions since I have had this dream.

3) I also read Buddha Statues are symbols of the absolute unconscious. This could mean certain negative facets of my character are coming into my consciousness and I feel overwhelmed by their number.

Anyone have another take on this dream? I haven't quite explored the whole ""cursed object"" scenario. Any input appreciated. Thanks.",0,negative dream buddha statue hey usually look dream due nature dream hoping input dreamt attacked buddha statue everywhere went location would least one buddha statue would wake attack scared really trying defend dream said someone cursed also plumbing leak kitchen believe thought could feel overwhelmed people people potential buddha coming help advice may feel insecure people looking read somewhere denotes lose hope need change perspective also mean various insecurity must agree negative emotion since dream also read buddha statue symbol absolute unconscious could mean certain negative facet character coming consciousness feel overwhelmed number anyone another take dream quite explored whole cursed object scenario input appreciated thanks

11,What a nightmare,Dreams,"So, my mom and dad were in their room watching something on my father's phone, I went outside and holy fuck. There was a huuuge tornado coming towards us, I remember my neighbor's house getting absolutely destroyed by that thing. I whip out my phone start filming the tornado that's literally storming towards me, I start screaming 'Mom!' 'Mom!' but she doesn't hear me and finally after screaming like for 2 mins I go to her room and told her and dad (I was still filming), by that time the tornado's cloud is literally outside the window and from that cloud, a mini blackhole sized about uhhh a bed, started pulling part of our house and I was like freaking close to the window to film it, but then it suddenly disappeared and turned into black dust. Now the tornado destroyed our house and I was the first to get pulled, my sister was in the kitchen, I turned around and could see my mom, dad and sister holding hands as they get pulled by the tornado, as I get pulled up, I start spinning a few rounds and IDK how but I got away from the tornado and remembered a YouTube video about how to survive a fall, I think I landed on my right hand first and had an wound but other than that I was completely alright somehow and I still had my phone. I go the city and stand on a spot, I look back and I see a classmate going inside a remote or jungle-ish place. I call out his name several times and was happy to see him. I followed him and asked where we going but didn't answer, there were also other people there and my instincts were telling me that this is not a good place so I insisted him on leaving this place, as we turned back and were walking away, two guys with weapons just freaking scream and jump out of the bush on his and my side, we start running fast af, they still keep coming and we are dodging their hits, we successfully make it out. After that, idk what happened but I was suddenly reunited with one of my best friends. I made him watch the video I had recorded and as he did, I burst into tears.

13,Weird reccuring dreams about heaven and hell?,Dreams,"This started about 2 years ago, in my first dream i was in a very nice large house, not one I've ever consciously seen or visited. I was getting it ready for the souls because apperantly this is where we divide the souls going to heaven or hell. I was there for god (had this knowledge in my dream) to round up the souls going to heaven and Lucifer was there for the hell side. Lucifer was wearing a nice blue suit and had auburn wavy hair, again, not someone I've ever seen before. He didnt really help set up and was actually trying to flirt and distract me. What was strange was the feeling of familiarity, like I'd known him and done this before. In the end there were a bunch of souls going to heaven and only a handful on the side for hell. Then there was this little girl who was late and ended up running right twords Lucifer, NOO i screamed and got so scared because she wasn't meant to be on his side. Surprisingly he ushered her to the side for heaven. Relieved, that concluded my job and i was sent back to my life here.

My second dream was about 5 months ago, not much to tell but i ended up at the house  again and explored the heaven side. It was different from my first dream because i saw the outside of the house. It was weirdly in what seemed like a dessert oasis with a singular palm tree to the left side. It was a huge white mansion that was very greek inspired with columns. I went inside and was exploring the ""heaven"" part. There was a large pool right in the middle of the first room with lush green vines growing around the walls and random people just lazing about having fun. That room reminded me of a tropical jungle. In the dream i knew i wasnt meant to be at the house at the time so i was sneaking around i felt like i was looking for something or someone and ended up searching for a way to get to the hell side as well but never found it.

And lastly the reason im writing this in the first place was my dream about 3 nights ago. I was talking to my sister and told her very confidently ""you have your music and art thats what you're supposed to do. This thing with the house and the souls thats what I'm supposed to do i know it"" which is crazy. What does this even mean? I'm not a religous person at all. I am spiritual and have my own beliefs but these dreams dont even go along with those. I just dont understand how ""I"" would know thats what im supposed to do or even what that means.

If anyone has any thoughts or even reads this long mess I'd appreciate it. Is my higher self trying to tell me something? Am i just crazy?

14,Dream I overdosed,Dreams,"I had a dream I was overdosing on some form of downer drug. I felt myself dying, but I was saved. I didn't care at all that I was dying. I didn't care that I was going against my personal values. (In real life, I don't do drugs. I do however have a lot of loved ones who have had problems with drug use, and I used to take the occasional pill recreationally years ago.) This dream made me feel pretty sad. Lately I feel like my life has just come crashing down, everything good has failed. I'm sick from the past and terrified of the future. I'm trying to hold on, but with events that have happened in the last month, I feel like my life is hopelessly doomed for sadness,  pressure, and loneliness. I have a one year old son who needs me; I'm doing my best to hold on and move forward for him. I don't know.. dreaming about using drugs and overdosing just made me feel like I really am in a bad mental state, and I can't pretend I'm not, even though I feel like I have no choice but to suck everything up and act like it's all okay.

Man, older than I am, explaining something about a person who was killed.

He had a small, hand carved, icon, wooden, of the man.  Crown of thorns, stake through the stomach.  Staked to a tree.  The man said something about being able to use his feet, but his arms were worthless.

The man wanted some of my blood.
Showed me a mostly empty vial, what looked like pink sugar water.  Said he needed more.

I asked why, he wouldn't tell me.
I asked if I could have some too, he said no.

He wanted my son's blood as well.  A young boy was there.

A woman was there, she was with me.

He was snipping my eyelid, or putting something into my eye, not sure, but it hurt.  I've never felt pain in a dream before.

Before he could get to the other room, a stranger opened the door and shot him in the head, and he died in front of me.

I spent the rest of the dream sad and sobbing, trying to return to work but unable to pass through the day without snapping at someone or crying uncontrollably. Before the dream ended I was seeking help, someone to talk to.

17,Tldr: How to stop chronic nightmares? (Some lengthy examples follow),Dreams,"I have nightmares almost every single night (I have ptsd so I’m not sure if that is related to me having the nightmares or not) and I’m going nuts because of it.  This has been going on for quite some time now and I feel like I can’t get any real sleep.  Sometimes I fear going to bed and stay up just because I don’t want to handle another nightmare.  Sometimes I scream in my sleep, normally because I can actually feel the pain of what’s happening to me in the nightmare (being shocked/stabbed/ect.).  It’s always random; from being killed, me killing someone, zombies, being eaten alive by dinosaurs, creatures stalking me, you name it.  (At one point I had creepy nightmares that would link together to the old ones-each as horrifying as the next.  Such as being stuck in a house with a man with a shotgun and his crazed girlfriend in a house littered with beer bottles and cigarette ash and dead bodies.  They were pacing waiting for something but I had no idea what was going on or who they were.  And a fetus twitched and breathed on a table in the middle of the room surrounded by cigarette butts and blood.   Just a small sample of it.  A mild nightmare compared to some of my others but kinda weird.) 
So anyways!  
Does anyone have advice for how to get rid of these nightmares?!  I never feel rested and hate going to sleep because of them.  I’ve tried teas, putting smells on my pillow like lavender and honey, seeing a therapist, medication and nothing seems to work so far!

19,A dream within a dream??,Dreams,"I’ve been having weird dreams that I actually remember for a few years now, but this is the craziest dream I’ve ever had.

All the movie theater parts are lucid- I felt like I was actually there, chose my own seat, could say what was on my mind and so on, the other dream was a normal dream.

I walk into a movie theater and the lights are low. A bunch of people from my school are there, acquaintances mostly. Apparently the movie they are about to play is ninja warrior, it’s on the physics final so people want to see it. I fall asleep during the movie, and start dreaming. 

I am a mountain on an island. It’s like I’m the God of the island because my moods control what happens on the island. I go through many different “seasons” of moods, and the island changes accordingly, but then it stops changing with my mood. The rest of the dream is from the perspective of the Mountain, because that’s who i was. 

A bunch of characters are introduced and they all fly into the island. First it’s dragon tales, they turn into scooby doo. I remember laughing at this part of my dream while half-asleep in the movie theater.
The characters mentioned earlier become irrelevant as now the island is mostly inhabited by people. It becomes an escape for a lot of people, for those who weren’t happy with their old lives come to the island to get a new start. 

A princess does this, and she somehow gets married off. Her to be husband’s clan come to take her away in a fleet of like 30 boats. They say she can’t bring something she really wants to keep with her. She is instantly reluctant to go, and even though she’s still on the pier, she’s in their boat so she can’t get off. They don’t let her go and the fleet of boats starts sailing away. 

The island residents get protective of the princess, they get the boats to stop so the chief of the boat people (the princess’s groom to be) and the island’s chief talk. The boat dude says that the princess can be returned if the boat people’s guardian animals (tiger) can patrol the island instead of the island’s guardian animals (cheetah). I explicitly remember the scene where the chief is standing facing the water, and the boats are coming back toward him to return the princess and release the tigers. 

As soon as the tigers are released, the island people decide that they need to protect their cheetahs, a fight between the cheetahs and tigers ensues. I vividly remember the cheetah running towards me with fear in its eyes as a tiger is following it, but the chief of the island comes in the middle and kills the tiger. Last scene on the island is of the cheetah looking at the chief thankfully but the battle is still going on in the background. 

I wake up in the movie theater and at this point the credits are rolling for the ninja movie. The person next to me asks me “you ight bro??” Apparently I was laughing in my dream, and then I got really serious and scared while in the movie theater. Then I woke up irl...

Naturally, I was forced to go down there, but I wasn’t going to do it without a few party favors. I went to the fridge and stole an unreasonably large amount of beer. I then made my way downstairs. The basement was reminiscent of a cave. Deformed people with extra limbs and strange features were everywhere. It looked like a scene from the nightmare before Christmas. I observed for a moment, then, I released the beer. We all began to party together down there and I was having a blast. I knew that we were all equally strange and it was beautiful in a way. That’s when I began to get angry that we were forced to remain in the basement. Why should we not be able to have a nice environment to party in? Why are we separated from the “beautiful people” who we all knew were only beautiful because the owner of the house decided they were. I broke the bottle in my hand and the rest followed. We were going to climb up those stairs and take the surface for ourselves. That’s when things got violent. As soon as the basement door opened, all hell unleashed on the surface dwellers. It was bloody, it was mayhem, and it was war. We took over the whole house, and we then partied like there was no tomorrow.

25,Why?? Those 3-4 places often appear in my dream,Dreams,"There are these 3-4 places - a city centre with ""old"" looking buildings, team etc.. a drive thru the woods to reach a house.. a messy intersection with buildings people cars etc.. my old office campus with plenty of imaginary places like food courts, parking lots, open spaces, fences etc.. - often appear in my dreams.  All of them, except the last one, are ones which I am 100% positive that I haven't been to or seen in my waking time. 

Makes me always wonder why the same places keep coming again & again in my dreams :(

Also, to add, I never used to dream earlier (exhausted from work) and used to sleep like a rock. But offlate, in recent 4-5 years, I have started dreaming, but I never remember them after waking up (or after few moments of waking up), how ever hard I try to recollect them.

Any thoughts? Others too face this? Any explanation?

There was a rule I wasn't familiar with where after you drink, the glasses rotate and we toast again. They said it was to ensure that everyone's glass touches everyone else's glass. If the glasses are just being rotated, not shuffled, that doesn't actually make any sense, they'd just wind up touching the same glasses, but that's a logical detail I was too, well, asleep to catch onto at the time.

So everyone would pass their glass to the left. And while we were passing them, we would chant, ""pizza pasta put it in a cup, there's no alcohol the kiddies drank it up""

Last night I had a few dreams 3 different dreams to be exact. But the last one I had woke me up and had me crying. 
I woke up this morning around 6:45 and shortly after I started crying from the emotions I had running through me thinking about the dream. 
I had been in a dorm/apartment partying and having fun, drinks were involved if I remember correctly, while I was at the party I met a girl that I enjoyed being around and talking to. A little bit of time goes by inside the apartment and me and a couple of people leave to go and do other things, I asked the girl if she would like to come with us, she said no that she wants to continue to stay at the party and do whatever was going on (most likely just drink and party) in the dreams seems to me that it was a few hours later me and the people that left are heading back to the apartment/dorm where the party was, and when we get there their is ambulance police and everyone that was in the party is now outside the apartment/dorm,  
I go inside to find out what’s going on and the girl that I liked and I asked to go with me was on the floor. she had been raped and drugged, but no one was in the cop cars detained or anything they didn’t know who did it, they take her away in the ambulance and the next morning everyone is at school/college talking about it. While I’m in class someone is talking to me (not sure if friend or random class mate) but they tell me that she’s going to make it and is responsive in the hospital, I enjoyed her presence while we were at the party so I was filled with joy, I was going to go and talk to her at the hospital, and then I wake up around 6:45 and I get overwhelmed with emotions and that’s when I started crying.

35,The worst nightmare I've ever had..,Dreams,"A couple weeks ago I was having a nightmare, it felt so real that I didn't know that it was a nightmare. This dream was over a 12 hour long period, well, it felt like it.

I was walking over to a bus stop, and I got shot, in the shoulder first, the pain was horrible, then I got shot in the belly. I feel down to the ground laying face up, and just looked up into the sky. Then I got shot in the face, throug my open mouth, and out my cheek. I could taste the warm blood... A nurse came, but I think she was with the shooters, she looked at me and told me there was nothing she could do. I made her call my mother and put the phone to my ear, and told her to come. She said she was busy. After laying on the ground for 12 hours in horrible pain, she arrived, she ran over and held my hand. That's when I died, I woke up. I was sweating and started to cry, I've never cried as much as I did that night. I texted my boyfriend, told him about the nightmare, and don't remember what happened afterwards. Later that day I told my grandmother, and she asked me ""well, don't you think you got that nightmare because you are scared of being left alone"". That made me think.
I've recently moved into my own apartment(in july), and my mom gave birth to a baby boy in August. I'm so scared of not being my mother's little girl anymore, and scared of being forgotten.

38,once a year bad dream?,Dreams,"sorry if this lacks structure and grammar. it’s 3 am. anyway,
i don’t have bad dreams often. the last one i remember was from last october actually. that one began as a normal dream but i heard a random aggressive voice say “wake up right now and look at your closet.” that voice wasn’t heard before during my dream, but it freaked me out. of course i did immediately wake up and stare at my closet. nothing there lol. 
today my dream took place in a random hs gymnasium. there was many people from my hs (not in hs anymore) and new faces. i sat at the top in the back of the bleachers. there was a couple arguments between me and some people.  meaningless bickering really like “don’t sit there” and “you’re in my way” type. anyways they(idk who) began playing movies on a large screen. after the first movie ended i began a casual conversation  with people around me. during our conversations they started playing the second film.  we all were still talking and a girl from the conversation group next to us says aloud “i hate this part” and turns around covering her eyes. there’s a baby on screen and a balloon pops in front of it. then there’s a bunch of mini scenes building anticipation for a jump scare. after all that the orchestra music intensifies and drops and the baby flys onto the ceiling and is stuck. like those possessed demonic films. and there’s a devil/dead evil floating head next to it. and the teacher in the film is trying to save the baby. 
which i then woke up because i was confused and creeped out. do i take this as a sign to not have children? totally fine with me.  background info about me: 20 year old college student with moderate stress. nothing too wild just the normal college stress and anxiety about life.",0,year bad dream sorry lack structure grammar anyway bad dream often last one remember last october actually one began normal dream heard random aggressive voice say wake right look closet voice heard dream freaked course immediately wake stare closet nothing lol today dream took place random h gymnasium many people h h anymore new face sat top back bleacher couple argument people meaningless bickering really like sit way type anyways idk began playing movie large screen first movie ended began casual conversation people around conversation started playing second film still talking girl conversation group next u say aloud hate part turn around covering eye baby screen balloon pop front bunch mini scene building anticipation jump scare orchestra music intensifies drop baby fly onto ceiling stuck like possessed demonic film devil dead evil floating head next teacher film trying save baby woke confused creeped take sign child totally fine background info year old college student moderate stress nothing wild normal college stress anxiety life
39,my brain trapped me in itself,Dreams,"sorry if this description is too vague, the brain does it's thing after a dream

it was such a weird dream, i was sleeping and ""woke"" up and continued with my day. my dad said he wanted some help with something so we got in a car and went out. 

suddenly my dad disappeared , im alone in the car and after a while these kids come to offer me something through the car window, i refuse, they come again after a while, i refuse again until i finally agree. they gave me a cd to a video game, and i didnt have the console for that game, for some reason i was pretty happy about that gift.

for some reason in that moment i thought that i was trapped in some sort of puzzle or game , and i need to win to go back to my body. there was a sentence that was being repeated, i dont remember it unfortunately but i did try to google [it](https://it.google) in my dream. google didnt work, as if the ""game"" was trying to tell me to solve this on my own so i decided that playing the game is part of the puzzle.

so i went out to buy the console for the game, after i got to the store and looked at it i realized i couldnt afford it. a guy came at me and offered me it for free, i refused, he insisted. and after a while i agreed. he gave it to me.

43,I had this strange dream I was attacked waking up to chest pain,Dreams,"This was about 4-5 years ago.

It was a dream where everything was black and white. I was in a dark corner of what seemed to be the end of a hall way of a jail (there was jail cells everywhere).

Then, there was this black figure that showed up at the end of the hallway. It looked like a gorilla, but all shadows. It then came charging at me, and as I brac'd for the hit, I felt a pain, was still in the dream, but everything was black (I blacked out?) and I woke up.

I woke up, and I still had that pain. It was the only time I've ever experienced this before. I could hardly breathe, it took me a few seconds to catch my breath. It felt like a truck or whatever that was really charged into my chest.

So yeah. I don't know if that is something that just happens, or if it's something else, but the timing of it all was insane.

45,Terrified and Don't Want To Sleep Again,Dreams,"I had a super weird and freaky and stressful dream. I can't even remember it in full detail but there was this guy in my house pretty much possessing me. I don't know if I was me in the dream or who I was but it felt wrong and so messed up. He was making me do stuff I can't even remember but then there was a point where there was another guy (maybe even the same guy? Just a different form?) saying he needed me for sexual things. I fought it and fought it and he pretty much told me to stop trying because I was eventually going to give in to it. I had to do certain things before I was allowed to be myself again. I was hiding in a room around the corner (just against a wall) and he had forced me to play a song on my phone. I thought my phone was connected to a speaker but it wasn't so I left my phone in the next room and ran outside without it. I was just wearing a sweater and shorts and when I made it outside I tried running over to this hammock in our yard so I could sleep but everything was really freaky outside since I didn't have my phone and didn't have my glasses on. I tried to get to the hammock but before I knew it I was teleported back to that room and forced to be the guy again. I remember looking at this door and a woman was staring in at me with dark eyes (she kinda looked like a freaky/dark version of Fish Mooney from Gotham) and he took control of me and floated me up. I remember having a split moment thought of ""is this drug induced psychosis?"" (weird) and then woke up. I instantly started crying and now I can't fall back asleep. I was literally asleep for less than 3 hours. I used to smoke weed because I had nightmares so bad that I couldn't sleep but now I'm pregnant and won't do that to the baby.

46,"Family killed while I was on vacation, kidnapped by the murderer upon my return, police was called and murderer was arrested",Dreams,"So this dream starts while I was on vacation. I was with a bunch of strangers which apparently I knew in the dream. We were busy touring an area when I saw a real life family friend, let’s call him Mr F. He was obviously distraught and upset, so I approach him and ask what’s wrong. He barely looked at me and said that everyone that I know is gone, and not to go back home. Obviously, that’s just what I did. When I got home, there was a note that said something along the lines of, “Your family and friends are dead, now you will suffer the same way I have.” I don’t know what this meant, but my dream self started breaking out into tears and crying like no tomorrow. Eventually I stopped and heard a sound. I hid behind a chair and it was coming from the laundry room, getting louder. Then, my captor caught me, and pointed a gun at me. I begged for my life, saying that he and I should talk. He ended up not shooting me, but forced me to do stuff with him like watch TV. I asked if I could be excused, and he said sure. I ran up to my room, locked the door, and pressed the emergency SOS button on my Apple Watch, and made a 911 call. Right after I gave the address of where I was, I had to end the call because he was coming. Not suspecting anything, he told me my bedtime was 3 AM, which was kinda funny to real life me. I rushed downstairs to the door, and saw the police and fire department was arriving. I rushed outside, and the police rescued me. They ended up arresting the guy, and the chilling thing my captor said to me was that everyone involved will suffer the same way my family did. What shocked me the most about this dream was not my family being killed, but the extreme detail of it. From the exact location of the furniture of my house, to my Apple Watch and phone, and to the freaking K-9 units that came with the police. Anyways, do you guys know why this dream was so detailed?

47,I had a dream that Billie Eilish did spoken work poetry at out local mall.,Dreams,"As the poems went on, suddenly, someone with a familiar voice was speaking through a mic. But no one was on stage. Then i thought to myself, ""is this Billie Eilish ?!?!"" her poem went like this:

*Why do most people only paint the sky blue?*  
*When in fact, the sky is more than blue*  
*It could be pink, red, green, anything else other than blue.*

Something like that but she sings some of the words sometimes. 

Then i realized, i was part of the stage crew. So i went backstage and i found Billie, crouching with a microphone.  
I approached her and I told her that i appreciate her music and her art. She just ignored me and went out the stage to make an appearance. 

Then, as I look within the crowd, the real Billie was undercover with a camera taking photos of the fake Billie. And i thought to myself, is this some sort of message? Is she trying to prove a point or convey a message?

49,Just had a strange nightmare,Dreams,"I was dreaming of walking home after... something like work or school. Not sure exactly which one it was.

Well, instead of doing it like any normal person would, I somehow could smell the way home. No matter where I was I could somehow smell the way home and know where to go. At that point my thought was that only I could smell the way towards my home.

While walking home I realized that the way I went home was somehow different than before. However, my trust in my ability led me to blindly follow the way. During that time I also walked through others private property.

I also came across some cros between a siberian husky (physique) and a german shepherd (colors) that looked like it practically screamed loyality and came to trust it. I can't remember what exactly happened, but I think the dog was a stray, but I left it behind.

Then I suddenly came infront of a dog. It was a plain and simple white dog and looked quite similar to a pug, or maybe a boxer? It just sit there and stared at me. But somehow I knew that it was the boss and some evil thing that somehow manipulated the smell that I thought only I could smell and baited me there. So I did what every brave person does: run for my life.

My goal was one of the private properties I illegally walked through that I knew wasn't locked. I wanted to hide there. Thankfully the evil pug send only one of its weak subordinates after me to kill me. So when I arrived at the private property I found the loyal dog and together with it I defeated the dog that was sent after me, killing it. Sadly the dog was wounded by it, and I was quite exhausted.

So I went into the private property and helped the dog bath. I myself also got naked. During that time I also knew that this wasn't the end and was somewhat panicky. Finally I did what any sane person would do: Call the cops.

And here comes the probably most embarassing moment... When I called I was so freaking scared I couldn't say anything. It took me like 10 seconds to somehow be able to whisper ""help"". After giving the cop the silent treatment for something that seemed like an eternity I finally managed to calm down and speak coherrently. Telling them that I didn't know where I was and broke into the property due to being scared for my life and that some dogs were hunting me down.

And here comes the probably most embarassing moment... The owner comes home and realizes that someone broke in. The thing is... I was still washing the dog and am naked, which isn't the best thing. The owner was an ""old"" lady, looked like something like 60. So she had some short grey hair, but she was physically still fit. I can't remember exactly how I calmed her down and convinced her that I wasn't a threat, but I think I somehow hid below a blanket.

After some time I just suddenly realized that the evil dog send more of its underlings. Together with my loyal dog we fought against them. Not sure whether it was 1 or 2, but if there were 2 then the second got done in pretty fast. The issue was the last one, the strongest subordinate of the evil pug: a dobermann. I called it the ""old dragon"", cause it was so strong... I tried to attack it with my feet, kicking it in the head, but it somehow managed to use its head to catapult me a few meters through the air. Yup, it was just that strong. I was getting exhausted, while loyal dog was getting wounded when finally the police arrived.

Out of the police car 2 officers came. They looked like young adults, with short hair, but that was all I remember. One of them came forward, obviously underestimating the old dragon, and starting a fight against it, looking very confident. Well, for 10 seconds, that's when the panic set in. Luckily he was well trained and better at wrestling with dogs than me, so he managed to pull his gun out and after a short fight with his safety shot the dog in its head. This was the momemnt I finally felt save and woke up.

I didn't watch any horror movies, or anything where being hunted was part of it and didn't even play or read any games related to that. I also have no dog, nor much knowledge about dogs and only knew the names through google as it showed me a list of several dogs. The reason why I knew their looks is pretty much the same as everyone else would, cause living without seeing dogs either in real life by people walking their dogs or over the internet, or even in games is pretty much impossible. There was also nothing special about dogs in my life for literally years. I've seen dogs being with their owners many times, but had no interaction with them. The only reason I could think of was maybe some dogs barking outside my home as I dream came at around the time of the normal morning walk for dogs.

55,What does this mean?,Dreams,"I just woke up from this nightmare. Lots I could go through, but I’ll list a few key elements of this story/what happened:

1. really like girl/talking to girl
2. girl sent me message in French in which she replied with “je ne sais pas” in part of her message somewhere; reminds me of this song
3. as I’m heading to bed, I contemplate messaging her back and asking if she wanted to chill the next day, but I don’t want to seem desperate. Decide not to
4. I feel accomplished. Like at the beginning of that day I felt so unable and hopeless as to reconnecting with this chick, and by the end of it I already know that I have another shot with her and that everything is good. I think that if I can get her this quick I can get anybody (narcissistic)
5. so I’m heading to bed and the house I’m in is new as in just moved there and it’s kind of spooky 
6. tell myself I’d even face the scariest of demons/ghosts just to be able to follow through with this girl
7. as I’m walking to bed I turn corner and at corner opposite of me near bed I see this face with orange eyes hanging head low around corner. I look away and look back quickly and now he’s looking at me, grinning and wearing a fedora type hat
8. scream for mom. Then I wake up

After waking up, I Google the song that I was reminded of in my dream after that girl sent me a message in French. There’s a line in this song where it goes “sandpaper kisses, papercut bliss...” alluding to the idea of something starting out pleasureful, but ending up being painful. I could relate this to a past relationship of mine, and how it started out just as how I felt like that relationship was going to start out in my dream, but then never ended up working out at all in the end. The song (titled The Birds, Part 2 for anyone interested), also heavily references the idea of being a “bird”; a free and unrestrained individual, travelling from one woman to the next, unable to commit to a real relationship. I know it sounds stupid... and maybe I’m looking into it way too hard, but I feel as if this dream ties into real life stuff. I feel like that ghost at the end was a *haunting* reminder of not being able to commit to a girl and take on the responsibility of commitment of a real relationship. Also the “I could have any girl if I’ve got her” idea plays into the subconscious thought of doubting myself being able to commit and things possibly going awry if I ever went anywhere with her that maybe I’d end up drifting away and cheating or something. (I don’t know if these worries still apply as much as they used to to me, I feel more confident now but yeah).

I haven’t been in a relationship since I was like 17 (22 now), and I actually hooked up with the girl in my dream for a bit not even half a year after breaking up with my ex lol. Even though it’s been time that girl definitely caught me at a memorable and enjoyable time in my life in general and I hope I get the chance to kick it with her again one day. Fingers crossed.

Tomorrow/later i will reformat it and make i it make sense till then here are the notes. Never posted on here or even seen a post so could someone tell me if this has a common meaning.

Day/bright evening in a forest/hike trail. talking to someone on a radio about what if you fed a tiger would it leave you alone? radio cuts out. tiger is on the path, i try climb a rock/hill, fail. stand still for a bit, point behind it and yell look cow.
 It slowly looks around and moves that way. I say yeah you go that way to get it and ill go this way to get it. I leg it the other way of the forest walk. Feels like im moving pretty slow. Eventually come to a river which i walk into and run downstream hoping to loose its scent. I run by a few buildings on the riverbank, come to a fence that ends the river, its back fence on my cousins house. 
I call out to my cousin who is walking to a shed with a torch(is about 12), is now nighttime. Ask for a bike(my home is closeby and all downhill) he is reluctant but agrees, we walk into house. 
He says here you can cycle that and points to a chair, does that twice. I see two bikes the first is a toddlers bike second a large child/small adult as im thinking this will do i get the urge to immediatly close the door, somethings outside. Tiger i think.
 I close the outside door in the corner of the room, lifting the handle to like lock it. I slowly notice there is another outside door open in the same corner but on the other wall. I kick it close while still holding the handle up. As i do that the door im holding the handle up opens. I open my eyes and see a fucking pitch black animal like a rabbit sitting right beside me moving around on my bed, it stands up slightly on my dresser. I sit forward on my bed, moving away from it, it is so real im thinking how did it get in, through a window? I take a long blink to try get rid of it, it is now stationary on my bed, larger more furry but completly still. I have to blink a few more times before it dissapears.

59,A dream that stands out of all the others that I've had,Dreams,"So I had this dream about 2 weeks ago and it went as follow:
I go to a haunted house/circus ? With some people then I pass some sort of obstacle course and then I see a black man that looks like what I could only describe as a shaman and then he gives me an amulet and says something like it will protect me from getting sick and then I I get teleported to a house that looks like it's abandoned and the people and i go explore it and it looked torn and there was blood in some places and the rest is forgotten by my goldfish memory.
I wake up and just go on about my daily routine and don't get sick from my parents which are which is a miracle cause whenever someone got sick everyone got sick but this time I didn't thankfully. I do like to believe that that person was some sort of spirit since I have seen some weird stuff before but in real life and while sleeping.

60,A weird section of my dream,Dreams,"So I rarely have cohesive storylines in my dreams. I just remember bits and pieces that don’t fit together. 
There were multiple parts in my dream last night, including 
- being in a science class my mom and dad were teaching together 
— getting frustrated at the class and crying
- being in an orphanage 
- trying to jump out a window
- being at school walking in the hallways
- being in a water slide 
- trying to get out of said water slide and not being able to because i kept slipping (i feel like that one has an underlying meaning)
- and finally the weirdest part. there’s this kid i used to be really close to. we were kinda in friends with benefits territory. very close. but things blew up with us last year after he spread some shit and hurt some of my friends. but in the dream we were super close and he had his arm around me touching my waist and was slowly inching it down. 

this isn’t even the first dream where he’s been in it in a more than friends context. in another a week or so ago he was sitting in my lap and kinda feeling me up. both left me feeling weird.",0,weird section dream rarely cohesive storyline dream remember bit piece fit together multiple part dream last night including science class mom dad teaching together getting frustrated class cry orphanage trying jump window school walking hallway water slide trying get said water slide able kept slipping feel like one underlying meaning finally weirdest part kid used really close kinda friend benefit territory close thing blew u last year spread shit hurt friend dream super close arm around touching waist slowly inching even first dream friend context another week ago sitting lap kinda feeling left feeling weird
61,Hi! First time poster :),Dreams,"Hello! First time poster here. My dreams are influenced by whatever I'm listening to when I go to sleep. But I just woke from a dream that I was being french kissed for a long time, in the office in front of everyone and he didn't care, and told me he was taking me on his work trip, and that we were getting married, by a CO worker I don't know irl. Then  I accidentally paid for the trip with my own money and then was waiting for him to come. Back from lunch. In the dream he did look like a bf I had almost 20 yrs ago but wasn't him.
Sorry it's rambly... But I am constantly dreaming of being in a great relationship with a guy. My current bf I never ever dream of and I think I know why anyway.

62,"2 Dreams #19-23, I'm in a explosion of a nuke, another girl comes twice, and a quote from my dream",Dreams,"19

So in this dream I was on this island and was in this house on the island and it was night time and so as I was wandering the house I found this nuclear bomb on a basement with a timer and so the woman whom I was staying with told me,

""The government had no use for that bomb and had no way of keeping it from exploding so it's on a timer and could explode anytime we just don't know when so they put it here""

So after I heard that I'm like

""How do I get out of here I need to get out of here""

And as I'm trying to find a way off I remember that the blast radius is around 10 miles and as I remember that I want to get at least 10 miles away from the bomb so then after a bit... the bomb exploded and I'm like... no less then around 30 feet from it, so I expect to be vaporized but for some reason (though almost everything else is destroyed) and as I look around I see the area is filled with blue fire and in the middle of the explosion I saw this person and as everything happened I heard epic music for some reason (I wish I had still remembered the notes) and it was calming for some reason, then I woke up

20

So in this dream I'm walking to my house in this neighborhood and as I'm walking I find this wooden gate with these 2 kids and as I looked at them they made me feel uneasy but i continued my walk to my home and when I walked in it I had this feeling that they were coming to me and so I went to my mother's room but before I went inside I just decided that I had enough of it and turned around but I noticed something white and fluffy but I moved around it and went out side and when I saw those kids I decided to start fighting them since I felt like they would harm me either way and so one got on my head and then the other started to try and bite me,

but then I looked to my front door and I saw this big white fluffy girl and she started coming to me and then she started helping me, then I jump cut to being in the house and when I looked out side I could see her fighting those 2 kids.

Then i wake up

21

So in this dream the same fluffy girl is back but I'm on her back going to the mall with her, and when we get to the mall she drops me off and I get this hunch that she doesn't want to be seen and as im walking around the mall I notice this little girl and she asks me a question (which I forgot what it was)

And I knew she what curious so as i didn't want her to see the girl I came here with so I try to find an exit and leave and lose her at the same time so I try to find a way out but for some reason I cant find a exit and I then end up waking up.

22

So in this dream I'm in this arcade with my family and this arcade is huge,

So as I go around playing games i end up running out of coins and i have to find my siblings and after awhile (I cant remember if I was searching for my sister and brother or the rest of my family) I think I was trying to get out but couldn't, I'm not sure.

23

So this dream is short but very interesting for me,

So in this dream I was viewing many different parts of my past but a few I remember and I was viewing this guy (my youth teacher) in a red car in front of a park and again many others like what I described but forgot most of them,

Then my view cuts to this screen white a white/grayish background with black around the edges and I could see some words and what the words said was

67,I’m going to get fired for eating a customers pizza,Dreams,"I had a dream last night that I went to work. I work at a grocery store in real life. I just bag groceries and help people out to their car, so it’s not uncommon for me to have dreams about work but this one is the funniest. 

So I went to work, but when I got there my boss told me that my job duties had changed a little. Instead of bagging groceries at the register, I was now supposed to follow customers through the store and assist them while they’re shopping, bag their groceries and then help them to their car. 

So I went to help my first customer. She was a little old lady, and she was super nice. We went to the deli area and she handed me a slice of pizza. She said “you can have it” and I was like wow thanks and I stuffed the whole thing in my face and ate it while she wasn’t looking. Then I took things out to her car, and after I put the groceries in the trunk, she was all like “you put my slice of pizza in there too, right?”. 

And suddenly I started to panic, but I was just like “yeah don’t worry I put it in there”. And then I went back inside and she left and I was like oh shit I’m totally going to get fired for this. I suddenly remembered that I forgot to clock in so I went to the back room and I suddenly realized I wasn’t even scheduled to work that day. Then I was like “wait, can I get fired for eating her slice of pizza if I wasn’t even scheduled today?”. 

And then I woke up and I was really worried for like 10 seconds whether or not I was going to get fired for eating her damn slice of pizza lmao.",0,going get fired eating customer pizza dream last night went work work grocery store real life bag grocery help people car uncommon dream work one funniest went work got bos told job duty changed little instead bagging grocery register supposed follow customer store assist shopping bag grocery help car went help first customer little old lady super nice went deli area handed slice pizza said like wow thanks stuffed whole thing face ate looking took thing car put grocery trunk like put slice pizza right suddenly started panic like yeah worry put went back inside left like oh shit totally going get fired suddenly remembered forgot clock went back room suddenly realized even scheduled work day like wait get fired eating slice pizza even scheduled today woke really worried like second whether going get fired eating damn slice pizza lmao
68,Sharing a few dreams of mine that I remember,Dreams,"I've always had weird dreams, I'm going to share a few I had, hope you guys enjoy the read

""The dark figure, part 1 of 3""
I was laying in my room, my room at the time was quite small, my twin sized bed took up much of the room. The window casting the moons silvery glow in the room.

I suddenly jolt awake as a tall and dark figure ducks into my room. Easily 14 or so feet tall, but no other proper feature is available to describe. It's just a tall and completely black figure.

This figure moves silently to my bedside, and without a sound, starts to reach towards me, with one hand. I suddenly feel intense terror and begin to fight for my life. I reach around and punch with whatever strength I could muster.

I suddenly wake up as I realize I had punched a nail in my wardrobe. My hand bleeding rather terribly.

""The dark figure part 2""

I had rearranged my room. Months later, after my hand healed (I now have a permanent scar on my finger from the nail)

I was looking at the window, when the same dark figure dipped into the room again. Dread instantly filling my body when I sensed its presence. This time with my placement, I couldnt punch it, and it knew it. It began reaching for me again with no sound. How does such a large creature make no sound as it moves?

Terror filled my body once again, with all the strength in my body, I kick the creature and wake up, to the sound of my TV falling off the stand, that was at the end of my bed. I had kicked my TV clear off the stand. Strangely enough, I wasnt in any pain.

""Evaporation""

After that last encounter with the dark creature I have a few dreams that I dont know how to explain.

I was being held in place with a laser, it stopped me from moving, but I could feel something else... it felt like a buzzing in my extremities. 

I start to panic, as the buzzing starts to generate more and more pain. I gaze down as I notice my body being disintegrating, extremely slowly. I try to scream but the laser has stopped me from being able to scream out, as I slowly disappear. My blood, bones, muscle, and sinew disintegrated into nothingness.


I slowly become aware of being awake and that there wasnt anything there. 

""Aphophis?""

This ones weird even among them all.

I awake, feeling the sense of dread that I know all too well... except there isnt anything around.

I relax until I see something above me slither in the dark.

I glance up to see a snake, slithering around up around the ceiling. This thing is *huge*!

Easily 3 times longer and at least 5 times thicker than any normal snake, but with a glowing orange eyes, everytime it turns around, its eye glued to me. 

It didnt feel like it was perse... menacing... more like it was guarding me, or keeping me in place?


""The dark figure, finale.""

I stayed at a friends house. It's been about a year since my second encounter with the dark figure. I've moved on and almost forgot about it by now.

I was sleeping on my stomach, which is really rare for me. I'm a back sleeper normally. 

With me sleeping on my stomach, I didnt see the figure, it never makes any sound so I couldnt hear it enter the room anyway.

But I *felt it* it finally touched me. 

I began thrashing with a desperate fervor like I didnt even know I had in me, I suppose it didnt expect such a violent response, because it disappeared after touching me.

I ended up breaking my friends laptop stand, tore apart his blinds, and throwing the pillows I was using out of the room. 

I woke up at the edge of his bed, leaning against it in a crouched position, in a cold sweat and breathing like I had run a marathon. What brought me back to reality was my friends dog, Mickey, licking me in the face.

It's been 5 years since then, I have nightmares regularly about snakes, but I havent had one about the dark figure since.",0,sharing dream mine remember always weird dream going share hope guy enjoy read dark figure part laying room room time quite small twin sized bed took much room window casting moon silvery glow room suddenly jolt awake tall dark figure duck room easily foot tall proper feature available describe tall completely black figure figure move silently bedside without sound start reach towards one hand suddenly feel intense terror begin fight life reach around punch whatever strength could muster suddenly wake realize punched nail wardrobe hand bleeding rather terribly dark figure part rearranged room month later hand healed permanent scar finger nail looking window dark figure dipped room dread instantly filling body sensed presence time placement couldnt punch knew began reaching sound large creature make sound move terror filled body strength body kick creature wake sound tv falling stand end bed kicked tv clear stand strangely enough wasnt pain evaporation last encounter dark creature dream dont know explain held place laser stopped moving could feel something else felt like buzzing extremity start panic buzzing start generate pain gaze notice body disintegrating extremely slowly try scream laser stopped able scream slowly disappear blood bone muscle sinew disintegrated nothingness slowly become aware awake wasnt anything aphophis one weird even among awake feeling sense dread know well except isnt anything around relax see something slither dark glance see snake slithering around around ceiling thing huge easily time longer least time thicker normal snake glowing orange eye everytime turn around eye glued didnt feel like perse menacing like guarding keeping place dark figure finale stayed friend house year since second encounter dark figure moved almost forgot sleeping stomach really rare back sleeper normally sleeping stomach didnt see figure never make sound couldnt hear enter room anyway felt finally touched began thrashing desperate fervor like didnt even know suppose didnt expect violent response disappeared touching ended breaking friend laptop stand tore apart blind throwing pillow using room woke edge bed leaning crouched position cold sweat breathing like run marathon brought back reality friend dog mickey licking face year since nightmare regularly snake havent one dark figure since
69,My roommate and I both had sex dreams about each other within the same week.,Dreams,"I’m 23 (F) and my roommate is 28 (M). We moved in together July of this year. We used to work with each other and became friends pretty quickly. Our leases were up at the same time and it made sense for us to move in together as there aren’t a lot of personality types either of us would want to live with. I had stayed the night at his old place a few times and he never tried to “put the moves” on me, as I believe we’re both just not interested in each other that way. 

About 5 days ago when I got home from work he told me about his dream. He said I was recording the whole thing and he didn’t realize until after we were done having sex, which pissed him off in the dream. He kept trying to fight me but sometimes you just can’t throw hands correctly in a dream. 

My dream was 2 days ago. It was hyper realistic as I had been napping a migraine off throughout the day. In mine it started with us goofing around like we sometimes do, then there were two of him, with two different versions of his personality. I was having sex with one of them, but all “three” of us were still talking. 

So I told him about the dream when I woke up. Each time we came to the other with this information we’ve had a huge laugh. Nothing seems to have changed in our dynamic, I do think it’s odd that we both have had dreams in that vein about each other though.",0,roommate sex dream within week f roommate moved together july year used work became friend pretty quickly lease time made sense u move together lot personality type either u would want live stayed night old place time never tried put move believe interested way day ago got home work told dream said recording whole thing realize done sex pissed dream kept trying fight sometimes throw hand correctly dream dream day ago hyper realistic napping migraine throughout day mine started u goofing around like sometimes two two different version personality sex one three u still talking told dream woke time came information huge laugh nothing seems changed dynamic think odd dream vein though

i dream a lot, and try to record my dreams as soon as i wake up, because i like to tell stories and dreams especially. I have a plethora of dreams to post here!

so anyways, to the dream!

# Flare Cruiser

The dream started off with a birthday party, my little brother's to be exact!  
The sky was blue and clear and pretty, it was nice!  
We were celebrating it in the garage, where our family normally celebrates birthdays!  
(Its indoor, and its giant, so its good for birthdays down here in the south where we require air conditioning)  
There was a performer of some sort, i think it was a stage magician dude, putting on a show, and we were all watching.  
After a while, the door to the garage opened, and this man walked through.  
He was dressed in a black suit and tie, and he looked very somber.  
He told us that the world was ending at midnight, and to hurry up if we wanted to survive.

The dream then cut to the docks outside of this **giant** ship.   
We were about to board the ship, that's how we were to survive the end of the world, but first, we had to watch an informational video!  
It was interesting, surprisingly!   
It went like this:

>Welcome to the Flare Cruiser!  
This ship is designed to hold one billion people, one eighth of the world's population!  
There are 7 other ships, across the world, just like this one!  
What will happen is this:  
You will stay on the ship for a while  
You will sail across to the other docks  
You will exit the ship  
and You will walk the path to Not Dying!  
That is the path you will take.

There was another bit about the origin of the ship's name, some legend thing.  
Basic summary of it was,   
 \-guy named flare receives prophecy about the world ending from god   
\-he tries to tell everyone, they laugh at him  
\-he only managed to convince 7 people to follow him to salvation of not-dying  
and then the film ended, and we got on the ship.

Okay the ship was \*\*\*giant\*\*\*.  
Yeah it probably couldnt hold a billion people in it, but this is dream logic here we dont listen to reality.  
The interior of the ship was basically this one giant room, with a couple small rooms in one of the corners.  
Those small rooms were for the employees, not for us common folk.  
There were 6 employees, and each one had a room.  
There were three scientists and three engineers, that was it for our ship.  
Everyone else who did anything, was a volunteer.  
I hung out for my friends for a bit, but sooner than i expected, it was time to leave.

Everyone else started to exit the ship, but i guess i was a bit slow because one of the employees told me to speed it up.  
I left the ship, and walked out onto the docks.  
Buuuuut I forgot something so i went back on the ship to get it.  
Everyone else had already gone outside, so the ship was empty sans one other kid who forgot something too.  
I got my thing and went back outside.  
I think it was like a lanyard or something.  
I looked at my watch. The time was 8:30 at night.  
Despite this, the sky stayed day, like the whole time.   
At this point, however, the sky had some clouds scattered throughout.  
I brought up the rear on the line, because i had to run go get my thing.  
The line wasn't single file, more like an unorderly line, it was cool.  
One of my friends was near me in the line so it was cool, i could talk to him.  
Another one of my friends, I could see, but he was too far ahead to get to.  
Along the way were volunteers, stationed to give directions.  
When we passed them up, they joined the end of the line.

*and the walk began*

The first thing we did when we left the ship was take a right, onto the docks.  
Then, we took another right, onto the docks in front of the ship.  
I happened to glance to my right, when we were passing up the other side of the ship, and i saw 3 guys.  
They were huddling in the shade of the ship, and they were wearing robes  
I couldnt see their faces, i suspect they didnt have any, same with their hands.  
One wore a black robe, one gray, and one white.  
This is the second dream they've appeared in, they creepy.  
I glanced away for a second because my friend was saying something, and when i looked back, they were gone!  
We took a left turn again, and walked for a bit through the woods.  
It was a comforting mixture of cozy woods and creepy woods, it was nice.  
When we got out of the woods, i checked my watch again. It was 10:03.  
The skies were full of white clouds at this point.  
We walked through my school's courtyard for a bit, and took a left at the end of it.  
Then we walked over some hills, and through some plains.   
When we reached the end of the hilly area, and went down the last hill, I noticed that the sky was gray.  
It looked like it was about to storm, and badly.  
I saw that we were heading to a house in the distance.  
It was my grandmother's old house, on the outside at least.  
By the time we got there, it had started raining somewhat, and the time was 10:53.  
At this point, there was like, half the line behind me, from all the volunteers.   
My friend had fallen behind, and so i couldnt talk to him any longer. 

Entering the house, we had to go single-file to fit.  
And it wasnt my grandma's house on the inside, it was the house i used to live in.  
We walked through the kitchen, the dining room, the old playroom, and got to the living room.  
One of my classmates was the volunteer for that room, and he had a stereo.  
On that stereo, he was playing the song *The Lion Sleeps Tonight.*  
I looked at my watch, and it was 11:57.   
Outside, it was pouring.  
We took a left, and cut through my old bedroom, to get to my mom's current bedroom.  
Yeah thats not possible in reality, but yknow what? dream logic.  
My mom was the volunteer there, and was supposed to be directing people to go through the only exit.  
And make sure they dont try and go back inside, and ""hold up the line""  
But when I got there, she, for the first time, actually looked outside.  
And outside was not good.

What was happening here, and on each of the other 7 ships, was  
\-people were tricked into thinking that the world was ending  
\-they made the long journey  
\-they walked out that door  
\-and the employees killed them  
\-and dumped their bodies in giant piles  
\-and then when they were done with that, killing themselves.  
\-so that the entirety of the human race was gone  
\-so in that way, the world did end, at least for the human race

My mom had just realized this, right before i got there, so I was first in line.  
She closed the door, and was trying to bar it shut.  
The song was getting louder.  
The people behind me were anxious to keep going. they didnt know the truth yet.  
The time was 11:59  
It was absolutely storming outside.  
The employees realized what happened, and were trying to get in.  
One of them broke a window.

And I woke up!  
at four in the gosh darn morning  
The song continued playing in my head till when i went back to sleep, it was awful.

So yeah that was the dream, it was um, it was really something.

76,Some awful dream I just had about dying.,Dreams,"okay so i just woke up from a nap. and it freaked me out so much that i just started writing down what happened. 
my dream started off pretty normal, with me on overwatch; i was playing 3v3 death match on Lijiang Market. i was the last member of my team left. i was playing symmetra, holding myself up in the corridor with my turrets. i chased and killed their solider, meaning they only had 2 team members left. their D.va came full force at me— i de-meched her but time started running out. in the dream just then realized how the graphics were god fucking awful. like an outline of everything. but i kept playing. i had to win. so i needed to cap the point. i ventured out and the reinhardt(previously d.va idk when she changed) and road hog were chasing me there. but all of a sudden literally out of nowhere a jarring cut to a first person perspective of myself playing the game was happening. i was watching the screen. previously it was like a game recording— something you watch on twitch or youtube. i was visibly shocked by this causing me to just stop playing the game. like hands jerk from the keyboard so fucking fast. i has no idea what was happening, i was so fucking confused. then the game ended in a stale mate— time ran out. now as the second match started I noticed how the air was getting hard to breathe, matter of fact, i couldn’t breathe. my vision was also getting cloudy. white almost. like a bright light. it was as if i was suffocating. i tried to say something — i know my sister is in the next room over. i can hear her watching friends on netflix, like she always does. but i physically cant say anything my brain is too tired. like groggy. like you just got out of surgery and are drugged up so much you’re out of your mind (it’s what it felt like) i don’t want to move. i remember talking to myself asking why i was tired, i just took a nap an hour ago. so now i’m panicking but the only thing i can do is lazily throw my keyboard off my desk to make noise and to get someone to help me, but it doesn’t hit the ground since it’s attached to my monitor; it just swings. the next thing i know is in my head i’m shouting for help, because that’s the only thing that’ll work. my head is hanging low and i’m shouting for me to move, to get up and get help but it’s no use and just as i start slumping out of my chair and everything is white and blinding— BOOM i wake up and i’m completely under my covers, head and all. first thing i google is, “can you suffocate with your head under the covers?” obviously not. but i fucking couldn’t get over how real that felt. it was like i was actually dying. or fainting for that matter; and i remember everything. i’m awful at writing and describing things but nothing i googled helped. i mean this type of feeling has happened before and both times i have been under my covers when i woke up. so idk if i unconsciously lower my breathing rate, or something but it’s freaking me out. 

can anyone relate? like does this shit mean anything? my only friend told me to pray to god but i don’t think that’s it. idk it freaked me the fuck out.",0,awful dream dying okay woke nap freaked much started writing happened dream started pretty normal overwatch playing v death match lijiang market last member team left playing symmetra holding corridor turret chased killed solider meaning team member left va came full force de meched time started running dream realized graphic god fucking awful like outline everything kept playing win needed cap point ventured reinhardt previously va idk changed road hog chasing sudden literally nowhere jarring cut first person perspective playing game happening watching screen previously like game recording something watch twitch youtube visibly shocked causing stop playing game like hand jerk keyboard fucking fast idea happening fucking confused game ended stale mate time ran second match started noticed air getting hard breathe matter fact breathe vision also getting cloudy white almost like bright light suffocating tried say something know sister next room hear watching friend netflix like always physically cant say anything brain tired like groggy like got surgery drugged much mind felt like want move remember talking asking tired took nap hour ago panicking thing lazily throw keyboard desk make noise get someone help hit ground since attached monitor swing next thing know head shouting help thing work head hanging low shouting move get get help use start slumping chair everything white blinding boom wake completely cover head first thing google suffocate head cover obviously fucking get real felt like actually dying fainting matter remember everything awful writing describing thing nothing googled helped mean type feeling happened time cover woke idk unconsciously lower breathing rate something freaking anyone relate like shit mean anything friend told pray god think idk freaked fuck
77,What does this bizzare dream mean? (Interpretate please!),Dreams,"In this dream, I was in a random house, that in the dream I aknowledged as the house I'm living in.

There are teachers and all of my parents standing facing me. Infront of all of them was an unknown woman. The dream went on with this weird dialog scenario:

Parents and teachers: Look, we found you a girl!

Me: I don't want her.

Parents and teachers: She is yours now.

Me: I DON'T want her.

In the midst of the scenario, the girl's face was shifted to Momoh's face. (The scary girl from the mysterious phone number  [https://paranormalglobe.com/2018/07/25/who-is-momo/](https://paranormalglobe.com/2018/07/25/who-is-momo/) ), at this point I started to get horrified.

Me: Get her off me!

Parents and teachers: Take her!

Me: NO! Get her away!

Then I started to scream constantly begging them to get her away.

78,Well that was unsettling,Dreams,"Its all a bit jumbled... but here we go.

Dream 1, a tortue house. A young girl is forced through the maze with each room either forcing her to walk on broken glass, have nails fall down on her ect.

Dream 2, somewhat continued? Im hiding, a red/black ghost/demon helps me, but each tim he does a red/black rabbit appears and counts. I am aware that he will help me three times before taking me as his own victim. I remember laying down behind a white double door with a square window in each door.

Dream 3, we are in a goth shop, the layout is weird, you enter through one door but exit through another. I pick up clothes i already own (they were stored there for some reason) and have to mess about trying to fit them in bags.

I have a wig on that is really too heavy, the hair is styled simmilarly to my own (black with a white section at the front) but its pinned back around a pair of white horns and a silver tiara. 

At one point my friend wants to put my wig on and i oblige because its very heavy. He doesnt put it on right and im getting cross as shes getting it all tangled. 

Next i am on a bus, and im trying to get all my shit in order and maybe rearrage my bags so i dont have as many. (Random side note, the bus had a random table and chairs like a cafe) 

This merges into...

Dream 4, my partners father is trying to start a commune. There are strange people in the house (that doesnt match our IRL house) and theres weird half anamatronic people. I am unnerved by all of it. I get flash images of the basement, it matched what i have seen in a pervious dream but not our IRL basement. 

I see for a second this father figure who is drying off after a shower. I cant see propperly as i dont have my glasses on but i can see that he looks much much younger. His hair no longer grey and is now a dark brown and full. He is somewhat handsome and i comment as such. 

I am back in our bedroom with my partner discussing how strange this all is. I note we also have what double doors with a square window in each. 
One of the many cats is being loving (we IRL have two but here... i have no idea theres LOTS) i tell my partner im weirded out by this whole commune thing. He tells me its not really a commune and that hes looking to make a family and it makes him happy.",0,well unsettling bit jumbled go dream tortue house young girl forced maze room either forcing walk broken glass nail fall ect dream somewhat continued im hiding red black ghost demon help tim red black rabbit appears count aware help three time taking victim remember laying behind white double door square window door dream goth shop layout weird enter one door exit another pick clothes already stored reason mess trying fit bag wig really heavy hair styled simmilarly black white section front pinned back around pair white horn silver tiara one point friend want put wig oblige heavy doesnt put right im getting cross shes getting tangled next bus im trying get shit order maybe rearrage bag dont many random side note bus random table chair like cafe merges dream partner father trying start commune strange people house doesnt match irl house there weird half anamatronic people unnerved get flash image basement matched seen pervious dream irl basement see second father figure drying shower cant see propperly dont glass see look much much younger hair longer grey dark brown full somewhat handsome comment back bedroom partner discussing strange note also double door square window one many cat loving irl two idea there lot tell partner im weirded whole commune thing tell really commune he looking make family make happy
79,My Strange Dream,Dreams,"Hello reddit. This is going to be my first time joining the community but I felt like I wanted to know your opinion on a dream that I had. Ill write as much that I could remember. 

  It stared with me on a ship, but not just any ship the pirate ship of the Straw Hats, but the ship was not like in the anime.  It just looked like any ship, with barrels and boxes ext. I walked up just to see one of the crew mates (Usopp) telling (Robin) "" Hey why wont you go out with me huh"" and even tho that's not how Usopp acts that's how he acted in my dream. And Robin with a blank expiration on her face just just says  ""kajsdljflk..."" I cant remember what she said, but once  I walked in the room they stop Usopp takes his arm off around Robins shoulders and they sit there quit. I lay down on what I think was a hammock. When all of a sudden someone screams out we're here, and I could feel like we were in a movie type dream cause  I could see the island from a birds eye view. I couldn't see much since it was dark out but once we got there we walked to a huge house and when I say huge I mean we where practically ants looking at this giant steps, with and even gianter...er er door. We slowly walk up close to the steps, and BAM!! someone slides open there peep hole form the door and an old women calls yells out "" WHO IS THERE!,"" I could feels my self looking down with my eyes close like {dam we got caught} and I scream out "" ITS US OLD WOMEN OPEN UP, WE'RE HERE ABOUT THAT THING"" we could see here eye looking down on us, and then closing the peep hole she opens the door, a huge old women looking like ""Yubaba"" from spirited away, which makes sense on whats about to happen next, but she looked a lot kinder. she says ""come on in."" and as we straggled to get up the steps all of a sudden we start growing bigger, and bigger and bigger until we finally where about her size. (And not going to lie it felt wired, and I kinda new it was a dream but just having that experience felt wired, my body growing and... yah just felt wired."" once we get in she goes to the other room to get some snacks, we apparently had coat and we just throw them down the room. And as she is walking back she says and she is walking slouched down "" You can put your coat on the.."" she stops and looks around ""hangers"" looks at us and says "" oh my, oh my"" in a sweet kind voice. I kinda laughed in the inside, but I told the rest to put the coats in the hangers. And once all that was finish she came back and said ""so are you guys ready"" looks around with her hands curled up to her chest. She says ""alright then get in a circle, and close your eyes."" we all do that and I could feel Robin sitting next to me, and the she says ""alright once we go in here don't get lost stay close. (and for those that watch  One Piece, no Zoro did not get lost.) But once again we had an out of body experience and we turn white, kinda like in the Harry Potter movies. And we go inside this white mist spiral, and  i think looking around floating I was amazed I don't remembered if i could hear voice but I just couldn't stop looking around, it was so white and looked like I was inside a could, but I just cold not look away. But then I look around and felt like I was lost, but quickly find the others. We land in this star way and I look down as I see a spiral hall way going all the way down, and when you went down you could see rooms with people taking care of what seemed like balls of pure mist kinda like living, and we walked down and every once an a while we kinda talked to them and I don't remember what we where talking about but it made me happy just being there and talking to them, and the further down we went you could also see that there where also black ones but they had the same feeling as the white once warm and even tho I don't think I talked to them it felt nice just seeing both black and white mist there. We finely got down to what seem to be a train station and there it looked more gray kind people where not necessarily happy but they where't sad either, I mean some where't and some where. There where kids, adults and so many different types of people there. And Yubaba had changed into someone younger looking and this time it was Mary Poppins from the new remake I think, also the Straw hats where no longer the straw hat but other kids. Mary Poppins was wearing a bright red hat type red lipstick but she had like in the movie I think. But it was black and white like half in one side was white and on her sleeve was black and so on in the other side but opposite, she also had very light blue eyes, so blue that they seemed like they where glowing. Anyways we walk down the station and she goes and talks to someone in the front, then comes back and says  ""sorry guys"" in a British accent. "" but it looks like I cant take you on the train, looks like i don't have restriction to take you down there."" sighs and looks around as we catch a gimps of some girls getting of the train, they looked like girl scouts all dressed like it too but with just black in gray everywhere even there face, no color, she goes and talks to them and I think she drops something from there hands and then looks at us as to tell us lets go. We start walking in a fast pace as we get on a train, once were in the train tho there is not a lot of people and its dark and cold as well. And just like the last spiral hall we went down what seemed to be the same, but the only difference was that it was pitch black that I couldn't see anything and all I could hear was the sound of the train going down the rails, and every so often I could see glimmers of light and when I did I could see the sad faces of some people that where with me. Finally at the end, we end up in this small room almost simmer to a Doctors office. And the first thing that I saw was a black cat plying with what seemed the black mist balls but they didn't have mist and you could see a face kinda like the black balls of Mario the Keronpa balls but more realistic and with some feel of it being almost human, but kinda dead like a fish, a ball longer round with eyes and teeth gasping for air. They where in this box thing with only one exit which the cat was keeping guard not any of them pass almost seemed like he was playing with them like yarn, the black things came in different sizes but there where only 7 of them in there and the 8th right beside them a huge one guarded by a huge dog, so huge that it just seemed like a fur all. We kept walking further and we came across a Doctor looking fella, he looked like he might of been in hes 30s, he looks at a kid that is right beside me and says "" are you sure you wanna do this. The boy looks at him with confidence and says ""yes."" The doctor pulls out a revolver covered in all black mist and points it a girl looks like maybe in her teens bold hair but couldn't say for sure everything in that room didn't have color but i could tell she was a blond, no one I new and as for the boy he looked like that kind from the ""Netflix show the umbrella academy  the time traveler"", the Doctor still pointing the gun to the girl... BOOM shoots her in the head and then pushes her down a window? to the dark abyss and then shows up again the Doctor looks at the gun and gives it to the boy and says "" But look her twin over there is not the same. Because if you do shoot her she will die"" we look at the girl laying down at a table like if she was dead, but at the same time was alive but not just there. the boy looks at the Doctor and says ""i'm sure I want to do this"" he walks to her looking at her with out any expiration on his face points the gun at her wondering where should he shoot her, even covering  his eyes with his hand. And I overhear the Doctors just say hope he doesn't do it, because if he does it will taint his ""sole"" at least that's what I think they said. but in the end he could't do it and walks away, I fallow and end up in the train going back and then.... I wake up feeling a bit calm and fine.

83,I had a weird nightmare last night,Dreams,"This going sound strange and confusing also I feel like my grammar is bad so please bear with me lol.

The reason why I'm posting this here is that I find this quite interesting and I need help understanding more about what my dream trying to tell me ( some are really obvious to me). I'm happy to hear your thoughts and opinions on it :).


So in the dream a person that I know in real life ( I'll refer to him as ""G"") that I have a crush on, low key doesn't show me attention on purpose when I try to talk to him or when I snap chat him (and I think he doesn't like black people and I'm black)  

Anyway, 🤣😅 G was taking me somewhere we could hang out so I could get out of the house of my psychologically abusive and controlling parents ( they are in real life). So when we got there it was a cold and very dirty motel lobby ( it kind of reminded me of a slaughterhouse you'll see in a scary movie with metal walls). The guy working in the lobby was telling G that  I'm not welcomed here because I'm black but somehow convinced him to let me hang out in the lobby with them. So G and I sat down and we both pulled out our phones and we didn't speak to each other at all. 

While we were sitting there for a while, I started to feel much more concerned about my safety there. Then all of a sudden these big white dudes come barging in the lobby with clown make-up on. One stood up against the wall right in front of me and the rest sat in front of a tv ( the seating arrangement reminded me of a church ). Then one of them whispered and said: "" why is that n**ger here?"". So I kind of got the hint that G set me up and they were going to kidnap and imprison me.

 So the guy working in the lobby screamed at me ""leave now!"" Multiple times. So I rushed and grabbed my charger for my phone in the wall and for some reason I went to the back and grabbed something and right before I was going to run out the door, I forgot something again and ran back to get it ( keep in mind the clowns didn't move a mussel like I wasn't there and they didn't put any effort into scaring me).

 So eventually I ran out to the parking lot in fear of my life like I was being chased, but I wasn't, it was just me. Then when I was crossing the street out of the parking lot, I noticed it was located in the back of my church for some odd reason. Then my alarm woke me up, end of dream.",0,weird nightmare last night going sound strange confusing also feel like grammar bad please bear lol reason posting find quite interesting need help understanding dream trying tell really obvious happy hear thought opinion dream person know real life refer g crush low key show attention purpose try talk snap chat think like black people black anyway g taking somewhere could hang could get house psychologically abusive controlling parent real life got cold dirty motel lobby kind reminded slaughterhouse see scary movie metal wall guy working lobby telling g welcomed black somehow convinced let hang lobby g sat pulled phone speak sitting started feel much concerned safety sudden big white dude come barging lobby clown make one stood wall right front rest sat front tv seating arrangement reminded church one whispered said n ger kind got hint g set going kidnap imprison guy working lobby screamed leave multiple time rushed grabbed charger phone wall reason went back grabbed something right going run door forgot something ran back get keep mind clown move mussel like put effort scaring eventually ran parking lot fear life like chased crossing street parking lot noticed located back church odd reason alarm woke end dream

85,My personal experience with re-ocurring lucid dreams and those dreams affecting my waking life.,Dreams,"This account of events throughout my life will be long-winded, to say the least, and as such, I will attempt to only give pertinent information as context to keep it as short as possible. My reason for writing this report is because I want to see if anyone can shed some light on the experiences I have had via dreams that have baffled me since childhood, and if it is possible for them to actually be affecting my waking life. While I have a multitude of other, more existential questions because of these dreams, for the sake of length and accessibilty, I will be focusing on only the aforementioned aspect here.

Firstly, Context. I am a (17)M who has grown up in a small, boring town; aka nothing interesting ever really happens. While I did not have a horrible childhood, I have had a few large traumatic experiences that, while not clinically proven, i believe have given me less extenuated forms of PTSD, as well as a history of mental illness, which I've always just repressed and pushed away as to not deal with it (the reason I include this information is the possiblity it has some connection to the dreams.)

Now we can get to the good stuff; while I didn't know it as a child, a few years ago I did some research and realized I have very frequent lucid dreams, sometimes reocurring, yet not always. The ealiest ones I can remember are reflections of the games I was playing as a young kid, where I would be represented a world with mechanics that worked similarly to the games (HALO for example) and I would have complete control over how I went about completing my objective as long as it fell within the rules of the game. These dreams would happen again and every time I would do the same ""mission"" but choose a differnet path to complete the objective. I actually came to enjoy these dreams growing up as they happened for many differnet games and before long I was able to easily distinguish between a lucid-esque dream I was having and a normal dream.

The first time I had a waking experience that I believe these dreams had affected was the first time I practiced shooting a gun in real life. Throughout all the different scenarios of dreams I have had, multiple different games had modern first-person shooting mechanics to them, and throughout the dreams I would learn how to handle the guns and became accurate at shooting them, because while the dreams had to obey the laws of the game, it was still my job to complete the objective in the game of my own volition. I never thought anything of this, but then when I picked up my first hand-gun in real life and shot it at the target, the motions felt practiced, they felt natural, like I already knew what to do, and, in a way, I did. I had practiced shooting similar handguns throughout multiple different reocurring dreams I had so for me the motions felt no different in real life.

This fact astounded four-teen year old me, and made me really start wondering if these skills I've been learning through my dreams have been transalting over to real skills in my waking life. I decided to investigate further, and realized that a lot of the skills I have learned throughout all of my re-ocurring dreams have legitimately transferred to real life. Like I said before, I was able to shoot a real gun accurately because of the dreams that were reflections of first-person shooter games, but I had also had a lot of dreams having to do with stealth mechanics (the dishonered game series) as well as hand-to-hand combat sequences. I had never really tried it before but when I did, I was able to walk almost making no sound regardless of the shoes or ground, as well as efficiently scale up the sides of buildings and such in a parkour fashion, the exact same way I had learned to via the dreams. Then, on the hand-to-hand combat aspect, I went to the local martial arts gym and had a couple sparring sessions with a a friend who had been doing MMA style training for a few years, and what I discovered legitimately blew my mind. I could effectively read his stance, see his moves coming, and act accordingly, even though I had never had that sort of real training, as well as the fact that I've never been in a real fight.

All of this ultimately begs a question that has plagued my mind; How is this possible? Is it even possible? I'm not an exceptionally talented person so i don't think all of these things are just coming naturally to me, as well as the fact that it is only skills I specifically learn through my lucid dreams that come naturally to me. If anyone who is much more researched on this topic than I could please shed some light on this for me, It would help ease my mind a lot. As I mentioned in the intro, there are lot more aspects and different forms my lucid dreams have taken throughout the years, but I felt like this was a good place to start.",0,personal experience ocurring lucid dream dream affecting waking life account event throughout life long winded say least attempt give pertinent information context keep short possible reason writing report want see anyone shed light experience via dream baffled since childhood possible actually affecting waking life multitude existential question dream sake length accessibilty focusing aforementioned aspect firstly context grown small boring town aka nothing interesting ever really happens horrible childhood large traumatic experience clinically proven believe given le extenuated form ptsd well history mental illness always repressed pushed away deal reason include information possiblity connection dream get good stuff know child year ago research realized frequent lucid dream sometimes reocurring yet always ealiest one remember reflection game playing young kid would represented world mechanic worked similarly game halo example would complete control went completing objective long fell within rule game dream would happen every time would mission choose differnet path complete objective actually came enjoy dream growing happened many differnet game long able easily distinguish lucid esque dream normal dream first time waking experience believe dream affected first time practiced shooting gun real life throughout different scenario dream multiple different game modern first person shooting mechanic throughout dream would learn handle gun became accurate shooting dream obey law game still job complete objective game volition never thought anything picked first hand gun real life shot target motion felt practiced felt natural like already knew way practiced shooting similar handgun throughout multiple different reocurring dream motion felt different real life fact astounded four teen year old made really start wondering skill learning dream transalting real skill waking life decided investigate realized lot skill learned throughout ocurring dream legitimately transferred real life like said able shoot real gun accurately dream reflection first person shooter game also lot dream stealth mechanic dishonered game series well hand hand combat sequence never really tried able walk almost making sound regardless shoe ground well efficiently scale side building parkour fashion exact way learned via dream hand hand combat aspect went local martial art gym couple sparring session friend mma style training year discovered legitimately blew mind could effectively read stance see move coming act accordingly even though never sort real training well fact never real fight ultimately begs question plagued mind possible even possible exceptionally talented person think thing coming naturally well fact skill specifically learn lucid dream come naturally anyone much researched topic could please shed light would help ease mind lot mentioned intro lot aspect different form lucid dream taken throughout year felt like good place start

Had this dream about quitting a Broadway show after 
being assigned the main character(I have never acted in my life but have a school presentation coming up) and then getting on a black bullet train that used coal. I found it was going the wrong way but when I got off, down the stairs to the station there was my dads neighbourhood.

87,Intense romantic dream about my crush at university,Dreams,"I (26F) had a dream last night about my crush from university. I haven't spoken to him in 7 years.

Basically, I had bad social anxiety in uni, he was my flatmate. I was never very successful with guys, either friendship or romantic wise, and he showed me attention and was friendly for the 3 months I knew him, which for me felt wonderful. Due to my anxiety and mental health issues I moved out of the flat early, and we never really hung out again. He was very outgoing and friendly with the rest of our flatmates, and I felt very out of place and lonely. I struggled to fit in with them, and in all honesty, part of the reason I left the flat was my anxiety made me feel I was about to have a breakdown so I left for my mental health. 

The last few weeks I lived with him, we didn't hang out so much, and I think he became aware of how isolated I was becoming from himself and others. I think he didn't know how to communicate with me any more because the initial confident shell I had put on at the beginning had crumbled and I began to stay in my room a lot and isolated myself from others. But looking back, I definitely had a crush on him and was sad we drifted apart. 

Anyway, he got a girlfriend after I left and 7 yrs on, they're married with a baby on the way (the joys of Facebook lol). The funny thing is, I don't generally think about him or that situation that much in daily life, and the experience has drifted in my memory over time. Though admittedly, if I'm having  the odd tough day of anxiety, I have a tendency to go back to memories like that and feel sadness and shame. 

Yet last night, I had a really intense dream about him, which surprised me as I hadn't thought about him for absolutely ages. It felt like it popped out of nowhere. I dreamt I had lost my virginity to him at uni, and he told me it was the best experience of his life. Later in the dream, we met up in our late 20s and he was divorced, no kids. He told me he was sorry for the anxiety I felt and that he loved me. I know, as I'm typing this I keep thinking 'jesus, this dream sounds like the lovelorn ramblings of a 13 year old Girl' 😂

I don't know where the dream came from, because as I say, I rarely think of him nowadays, especially as it's been so long since we last spoke. And I definitely wasn't thinking about him before I went to bed. The dream was so intense I've been thinking about it all day, but to be honest it's not made me feel very good. I suddenly felt the intensity of my crush on him all over again and how special he had made me feel (even though I'm pretty certain he wasn't romantically interested in me in real life), but waking up just made me feel lonely and self-loathing.",0,intense romantic dream crush university f dream last night crush university spoken year basically bad social anxiety uni flatmate never successful guy either friendship romantic wise showed attention friendly month knew felt wonderful due anxiety mental health issue moved flat early never really hung outgoing friendly rest flatmate felt place lonely struggled fit honesty part reason left flat anxiety made feel breakdown left mental health last week lived hang much think became aware isolated becoming others think know communicate initial confident shell put beginning crumbled began stay room lot isolated others looking back definitely crush sad drifted apart anyway got girlfriend left yr married baby way joy facebook lol funny thing generally think situation much daily life experience drifted memory time though admittedly odd tough day anxiety tendency go back memory like feel sadness shame yet last night really intense dream surprised thought absolutely age felt like popped nowhere dreamt lost virginity uni told best experience life later dream met late divorced kid told sorry anxiety felt loved know typing keep thinking jesus dream sound like lovelorn ramblings year old girl know dream came say rarely think nowadays especially long since last spoke definitely thinking went bed dream intense thinking day honest made feel good suddenly felt intensity crush special made feel even though pretty certain romantically interested real life waking made feel lonely self loathing

89,"Brittney Spear,W.E.E., and Terrorism in reality TV",Dreams,"      last night I, as usual, had a ludicrous dream with a wide spectrum of pop culture references, colorful backdrops, and undertones of anxious fear. It started simple enough, with lights dashing across a gymnasium floor and WWE superstars tumbling about on the hard wood. Fan, presumably, were sitting in droves along the bleachers watching grown shirtless hulks fling each other underneath the raised basket ball hoops. It was weird, but not unusual until the spotlights shone on Brittney Spears. Fans cheered loudly as the lights gazed apon her and her fat sister, the bigger Brittney. The bigger Brittney threatened Spears to a wrestling match, but she couldn't because she was starving her boyfriend in the higher bleachers so he didn't accumulate fat. The light shone on him now and He stood uncomfortably like a skinny, fedora clad, weaboo. And that he was, armed with black hair and porcelain skin. At this point reality collapses. 
     With a movement of the camera they were in a 'Malibu sunset' mansion and actively recording a reality TV show when symbolism spoke. Her boyfriend, still unnamed, says he tripped before. And without reason I was shown his experience. 
      Colors began to breakdown like a malfunctioning TV before I was shown a cartoon, in looney tunes fashion, of Mount Rushmore contouring into images of angry cartoon eagles smoking cigars, when finally they took the final form of Osama Bin Laden and other Unnamed terrorist. And with that the horror show was over.

90,Violet Quartz,Dreams,"Hi,

I dreamed my ex-boyfriend proposed to me with a gold ring that had a large, spherical, clearish whiteish quartz ball on top.  He put it on my finger and when  I looked at the ball it had really beautiful violet hues in it and had a light coming from within.  I told him in the dream that I wanted to switch out the band for my grandmother’s gold ring band, so I could always have her with me.  I showed him her band and it was beveled with pearls. In the dream, I felt very excited and relieved about the engagement, but also worried that the quartz stone would chip over time. Thoughts? PS in real life the band doesn’t exist and I don’t wear jewelry or think about jewelry ever.  Re. context for my ex, we broke up two weeks ago. He’s wonderful and I haven’t had a connection like that before (nor has he, or so he says) but he has stuff he needs to work through and I don’t want to be his therapist.

And I put my arm around her all jokingly but flirty

And she smiles so I get an okay

93,Dead Grandfather in a dream with details I couldn't remember.,Dreams,"So last night I had a weird dream. The earliest part of that dream was me looking at a large bookshelf and I could have sworn that I was reading a book, and I could have sworn I had never actually read that book. The text was so foreign to me. Then I was getting dressed up for a party at my grandma's house and I walked in to the living room where my grandfather, who died three years ago, was laying down on his sofa. I was confused because I knew in the dream that he was dead and I asked how he was there. It was kinda like he answered but I can't remember what he said but I remember the voice being exactly like his. I then apologized to him for saying some rude stuff before he passed and told him I loved him to which he still didn't actually say anything but he smiled at me and it felt like responded. Then it sort of cut to me doing my makeup and some random stuff which probably means absolutely nothing. 
I'm still weirded out, I haven't thought about him for a while and to be honest with you I had already forgotten some details about him but they still were there in my dream. His voice was also something I didn't remember. It probably doesn't mean anything but it's so weird how my dream had things in it that I couldn't remember.

96,Had the most vivid dream of my night last night.,Dreams,"I was at some kind of show, I don’t really remember who with as I was sitting by myself. I was up at the highest possible seats sitting alone. My dad was there too but he wasn’t sitting with me. He was down quite a ways from where I was.

The elevation in this venue was crazy. I was sitting in the uppermost part of the stadium and it basically went above where the ceiling was. I couldn’t even see the stage (or whatever other people were looking at) which was why I didn’t know what was going on. It was also very steep, I felt like I was looking straight down the edge of steep cliff.

Eventually this little boy comes up and sits next me. He’s about 9 years old I would say and annoying as could be. He won’t stop screaming and he’s just punching me in the head. I tell him to stop a bunch and he starts climbing all over me. I am getting really mad at this point and I hate this kid. He had a really annoying face too, and he won’t shut his mouth. 

Anyways, his mom comes up and she tells him to stop it because it’s intermission of the show and they are going to eat. So I’m still sitting in the same spot and that’s all I remember for a while. 
 
Next thing I do know is that eventually the annoying little kid is back. And this time he’s straight to climbing all over me. I am getting super fed up with him and i yell down for somebody to get my dad. He comes over into view below me and I tell him that the kid is back. He yells to me that he‘ll take care of it. 

The kid doesn’t stop though. He’s on my shoulders pulling my hair and yelling at me. At this point another man has walked up into the section that the annoying kid and I are in. He is telling me to come down from there and he will help me deal with the kid. I’ve been dealing with him for more than enough time so I agree.

As I’m descending from the very steep steps towards the bottom of the section the kid becomes increasingly annoying. He’s on my back smacking me in the face now. I’m to my limit now and I throw him from my shoulders. I was only a couple rows from the bottom of the section and I throw him so hard he goes sailing over the railing.

I watch him fall what seems like hundreds of feet until he lands on his back on the floor somehow right in front of his mom. She starts screaming like crazy and I’m freaking out. The guy who had come up to my section to help tells me he is gonna start reading me my rights because he knows I’m getting arrested. At this point I’m scrambling but I need to get away.

I’m now making my way through the main part of the stands and nobody seems to know what I did. However as I’m trying to bet out I hear over the loudspeaker that my name is being exclaimed and I am being called a murderer. There are now a bunch of screams. I don’t think people know who I am but this is now chaos. 

As I finally find the exit somehow Donald Trump is right next to me and he is telling security guards to get me. I punch him in the face a few times (I guess because I’m already going to be arrested) and then sprint out the exit. I’m just running down a busy street now and I don’t see anyone or anything I know. Eventually though I see a police car come flying towards me. I feel a sinking feeling coming through me and the car stops right in front of me. Inside is Brie Larson wearing a black wig and she tells me to get in.

Now this is the last thing I remember for a while but it makes sense because I think I’m supposed to have blacked out in the dream. Next thing I know I’m inside some kind of lab with Brie Larson. I’m not exactly sure what is going on but I have a small tube attached to my body somewhere below my waist. It’s running up my right side and it attaches again to my chest somewhere. I have no idea what it’s purpose is, or why it’s there. I also notice that my hair is gone. 

Brie Larson comes into the room and she tells me that she is here to protect me. She’s part of some organization that is in charge of keeping me safe. She says the tube is to keep track of my vitals because after I passed out I was apparently not doing well. She cut off my hair so I wouldn’t be recognized. She tells me that we have to go do something now, and we go get in the cop car. She also gives me this old orange cardigan to wear as a disguise. 

We are flying down the street and Brie is telling me all about how the little kid was part of a rival group somehow and he was actually trying to kill me. None of this really makes sense to me but I’m just happy to be safe. Brie pulls into a parking lot and tells me to get out of the car. I ask her it it’s smart to be in public and she tells me we are going to “hide in public” because they will will find us if we are in hiding. I’m not sure who “they” are but I’m happy to obey Brie as she is keeping me safe.

So we walk inside and it turns out we are at a movie theatre. Brie buys two tickets to a movie and we go through security (there is very strict security here for some reason.) One of the things that happens here apparently is that they measure your labs before and after you watch the movie to make sure nothing is suspicious. Sounds a little weird to me but I guess that’s just what they do. After they take a blood sample from me I head towards the entrance to the theatre where Brie is waiting for me. She points out that my tube has come undone and that it will throw off my lab results after the movie so I should have it reattached by the theatre security staff. 

So I’m now having them reattach the tube and I’m looking through a glass window and on the other side of it I see Rashida Jones looking at me. Apparently she must know who I am because she’s looking at me in disbelief. She takes out her phone and starts to make a call. I’m not sure if she’s with me or against me but I don’t like the looks of this. The security staff has just finished up reconnecting my tube and I walk over to the glass. I can see now that Rashida Jones is on the phone and I’m holding my finger up to my mouth in a shushing motion. 

I then say “Ann Perkins” to her through the glass in the tone of Chris Traeger. (I was watching Parks and Rec as I fell asleep last night.) She seems alarmed by this and kinda runs away from the glass while still on the phone. I’m not sure what this means but I know the best bet for me is to find my way back to Brie Larson. I make my way back to the theatre and as I’m going in I can tell that there is a panic in the lobby back behind me; they must have found out who I was. 

I walk into the theatre and it’s absolutely huge. I’m looking for Brie now but the movie had started so I can only see the faces in the audience when the screen is lit up. I am looking around for what feels like forever and eventually I just go up by the screen and look back towards the audience. After a while I see someone waving at me in the back, it’s Brie! I make my way to her and sit down next to her.

101,Can someone help me figure out what my dream means?,Dreams,"Ok, so I've had a lot of weird dreams before but I can't decipher this one. I started as a young girl (Probably five or so) looking for her dad. I was in a really old antique looking house, and all the lights were turned off.  I was hiding from a very tall figure that had no face. When I got caught by them. I switched to supposedly the girl's dad. I was in the same house doing the same thing as the girl, but every time I hid somewhere the figure found me. They told me that I needed to go somewhere else and leave. I felt like they were trying to hide me from another thing chasing me.  After a few tries hiding, I finally left. I was on a brick street and the only source of light was the street lanterns. I was walking through the street and found a fenced off ravine, and I fell (Falling is a reoccurring theme in my dreams). I fell into what appeared to be a warehouse, and a wedding of some sort was going on. In one of the corners was the figure that was just kind of chilling.

102,The Little Brother Who Never Was,Dreams,"Have you ever had a dream, or a series of dreams, where you had a sibling or an additional sibling? I have, and thinking back on them, they're quite bizarre in retrospect.

A post over in r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix reminded me of a particular handful of dreams I had when I was a kid. Around the age of six or seven I started having dreams about having a little brother. Mind you, this was several decades ago now (giving away my age here), but this really started to bother my child mind at the time over the course of what seems to have been a couple weeks.

One particular dream I still remember quite well centered on me having a little brother who was a couple years younger than me, his name was Mikey, but the strange part about it was he lived on the other side of the bathroom mirror. My parents, in the dream, kept his existence on the other side of the mirror a secret and would not talk about it or would deny it outright. In the dream, Mikey would talk to me from the other side of the mirror, and play with me, but he would never come over to my side other than occasionally reaching across. His bedroom was supposed to be hidden on the other side of the mirror, in the dream. In other dreams of having a secret sibling, it was always a little brother named Mikey.

At one point, it had bothered my child self so much I actually asked my mom, ""Do I have a little brother? If I did, would you tell me the truth?"" Imagine your six or seven year old asking you that out of nowhere and already prepared and expecting to be lied to. ""Of course I would tell you the truth! Why would you think I wouldn't?""

In retrospect, the whole series of dreams were so bizarre, and the idea of your parents being able to hide a younger sibling from you in the same house for four or five years is just absurd, but there you have it, from the mind of my child self.

Anyone else have any similar dreams?",0,little brother never ever dream series dream sibling additional sibling thinking back quite bizarre retrospect post r glitch matrix reminded particular handful dream kid around age six seven started dream little brother mind several decade ago giving away age really started bother child mind time course seems couple week one particular dream still remember quite well centered little brother couple year younger name mikey strange part lived side bathroom mirror parent dream kept existence side mirror secret would talk would deny outright dream mikey would talk side mirror play would never come side occasionally reaching across bedroom supposed hidden side mirror dream dream secret sibling always little brother named mikey one point bothered child self much actually asked mom little brother would tell truth imagine six seven year old asking nowhere already prepared expecting lied course would tell truth would think retrospect whole series dream bizarre idea parent able hide younger sibling house four five year absurd mind child self anyone else similar dream

105,My weird dream ( Apologies for bad descriptive),Dreams,"So basically, in the beginning me and all my friends are on the porch this weird, wooden restaurant.  The restaurant was nearby a small, pretty sleep slope that entered the ocean.  It was drizzling quite for a long time, and the sea level was rising, and me and my friends all watched this professional/ hacker fish.  So then this guy manages to catch small fish, then bigger fish, then bigger, etc.  Until this guy manages to catch a freaking I swear 13 meter long salmon.  Pulling it back to shore, it’s head rips off.  Suddenly the rain is getting stronger.  It doesn’t seem much, and I expect it to stop. BUT IT DOESN’T.  Apparently I’m adopted in this story, and my foster mom screams to run.  I start looking around for some sort of transportation area,  but all of them are full.  but then I see a train pulling up in the background.  The rain is reaching my ankles, and I bolt the heck out of there.  I couldn’t say bye to my foster mom in the dream, nor the youngest one she adopted.  I looked back, and saw his blond hair, blue terrified eyes, and tears pouring his face.  Imaging Kevin McCallister in home alone crying, ( about 3”).  I keep running, and somehow end up in a fair??  I keep running, and there are these weird ass clowns just roaming on the streets, looking at my direction.  There’s no other way, since the path is too narrow, and I have to face all of these middle aged dudes in clown suits.  I pushed a clown and somehow karate kicked 360’d in midair or something and all of them went down like dominos.  I keep running, and find the stations I was previously at.  I suddenly fall down on my knees, and my pants get wet.  For some reason I can’t get up.. and I stay there.  Until something flings me up in the air like I was a doll or something.  I then run towards the station, up the stairs, but then I dive in the train car, but then the train door closes too soon, and I am sliced in half.  Then I wake up.

106,Most recent dream (happened less than 30 minutes ago).,Dreams,"In the most recent dream I had, I was going to go off somewhere and I was gone for a couple years or so (obviously when I was dreaming it, it didn't feel long at all) then when I got back everyone moved on, as in they grew up and they continued their life. (Naturally). However, after I returned, My dream me felt like I learned a lot from the journey I went on.
My dream me was sad when she returned and saw how everyone seemed unaffected by her leaving, but she also felt that she learned a lot when she was away. (Even though her 2 years was more like a couple minutes). My boyfriend, who I'm dating now, was also in my dream and he was older and had a wife and a child and he seemed very happy. In my dream, I tried to gather everyone who was in there around so I could all tell them what I learned and to thank them for letting me go on this journey, but they all disappeared before I could finish. I also thanked my boyfriend. Another weird thing is I woke up right as the dream finished. I didn't wake up in the middle of it or anything. I woke up very confused and trying to put together what just went on. I woke up a little after midnight and told Alex, my boyfriend and he looked concerned and sad.

107,Do dreams really have meaning?,Dreams,"TL;DR: multiple personalities in different dreams, trying to find out what it means.

I dream, as many of you, every night; and I remember some of those dreams, at least once a month. I am not interested in lucid dreaming, or remembering more dreams, it never entered my mind, which is the reason why this is my first post in this subreddit. But I really want to know what dreams mean, and what do they tell us about ourselves and our lives. I don't think dreams are random neuronal firing, I believe there has to be something deeper to it, and I want to know what it is. Because as many of you, every night; but there has been happening a peculiar pattern in my lastest dreams I don't know what it is about. I find myself having a different personality in my dreams.

For example, my last dream was a nightmare, so to speak. There were these men (20-30 year-olds) and they came to my house with knives and they broke in. I don't remember how many they were but they were a lot. And my mother and my grandma were in the house. Some of these men stole our car and the others just started to occupy the house, looking for something, behaving very violent against my mother and my grandma. And I fought back. I stood our ground and stuff, physically and logically, and I convinced them that it was in the benefit of everyone to go though this situation as peacefully as possible. I would have never had the courage to do that in real life. In other dreams, I am not only courageous, but confident, and capable, and strong-charactered; without knowing it is a dream, but behaving like that with the internal idea that I have always been like that. 

And in other dreams I have the same attributes, with the plus of doing things I WOULD NEVER DREAM OF. I mean, acquiring dark, machiavellic and cruel personality, doing things in dreams that frighten me, and getting away with it, and waking up not knowing why I did that in that dream, if it was so real. You know, when I do this things in my dreams, I don't recognise them as dreams. They are real while they last, it is not like I am dreaming and I think ""well this is a fantasy, let's pretend"". When I am dreaming, and I do this noble and monstrous things, it is like real life. So I don't know why I behave like that. And I am really curious to find out what it is all about.

110,This one almost scared the life outta me,Dreams,"Basically, me and my friend were walking down a path in this forest and we both came across this house. (it looked like her's) what I noticed was that all the lights were off and for some reason she decides to go inside.

I'm a bit freaked out cause the sky is already darkening, so I go in with her, and it's dark inside as well. not too dark. I also notice an axe sticking out of the floor (like someone slammed it into there since the floor was wooden) 

and as soon as I look up I see something that really creeped me out which was this huge looking bear silhouette that raced/dashed across  with these fast but semi-loud footsteps. me and my friend both go back outside and I see the exact same thing. it also looked like that it was armed/holding something sharp. and for some reason she goes back inside the house while I follow her. and we both see the exact same thing again.

So what she does is, she takes the axe out of the ground and slowly moves over to where the silhouette had last dashed over to, while I slowly crept behind with her... then after a few seconds of silence, this insanely large bear with the loudest roar I have ever heard comes out and catches me off guard badly, it was amazing I hadn't gotten a heart attack.

That's all I remember sadly. I think there was a part where I kept telling her to run instead but she kept trying/attempting to attack?",0,one almost scared life outta basically friend walking path forest came across house looked like noticed light reason decides go inside bit freaked cause sky already darkening go dark inside well dark also notice axe sticking floor like someone slammed since floor wooden soon look see something really creeped huge looking bear silhouette raced dashed across fast semi loud footstep friend go back outside see exact thing also looked like armed holding something sharp reason go back inside house follow see exact thing take axe ground slowly move silhouette last dashed slowly crept behind second silence insanely large bear loudest roar ever heard come catch guard badly amazing gotten heart attack remember sadly think part kept telling run instead kept trying attempting attack
111,I just had the weirdest dream and I feel pathetic af lmao,Dreams,"I just had the weirdest dream/day dream (I can't tell which at this point) and I don't know what to think of it. I was on the bus to school. I was with some people I knew from some of my classes (most of these people don't use the bus to school, but this didn't raise any red flags for me). Then I we got to a stop somewhere away from school (didn't even get there which again didn't raise any red flags). Then I was just walking (I think to school), and then I felt someone rest their head on my shoulder as we were walking. The person who is resting their head on my shoulder is the girl I like. And she is also holding my hand (I think). The weird thing is that if this was real life, I would be blushing like a moron, but I had no emotional reaction to this except maybe a slightly relaxing/comforting feeling. Also, she doesn't sound like my crush but I know its her because I recognize her hair, though I never see her face. She sounds way more high pitched than she does in real life, but this doesn't raise any red flags. Then we have a normalish conversation. She says ""Hi"" and I say the same thing back. Then she starts talking about something swimsuits. This is weird since I don't know anything about swimsuits but oh well. So she starts talking about swimsuits and I try to respond as best I can (I don't know anything about swimsuits, so I just try to ask questions and listen). Then I try to change the subject to a competition we had yesterday. (We had a competition and we won when we shouldn't have at all). The problem is that at this point, she says to me, ""Why are you changing the conversation? Why can't you just listen to me?. (Or something along those lines). Basically she was asking why I couldn't just contribute to her conversation and why don't I just listen to her and keep the conversation going. I feel really embarrassed at this point. Also, forgot to mention this, but she is still resting her head on my shoulder and I on hers. And at some point, (I can't remember which), we are in a car driving on the road. I feel like I am in the driver seat, but I don't think I am driving. Sometimes I say ""Whoah"" because we just ran straight through a red light or we nearly missed a car. So after I feel embarrassed, I apologize and try to tell her that I didn't know anything about swimsuits and that I'm really sorry. Then she is like ""ok. I understand. It's ok"". Then she holds my hand (I don't know if this true or not) and then I hold hers back. Kind of like interlocking hands if that makes sense. Then she kisses me on the cheek really lightly. Now this right here is one of the reasons I am even posting it. This right here felt so real physically. I've had realistic dreams, but never from a physical standpoint (at least any I can remember). And then I kinda blush and then I do the same. I kiss her on the cheek (and it felt real af) and then I wake up and look at the empty space to my right. I then try to go on my phone and see if I got any texts and try to do something, but then all I can think about is this. And I just feel pathetic. For some context about this girl, I thought she really liked me because we messed around this one day and I kept making her laugh and I felt great. Then I kind of dropped off a little and I don't why. Then she asked me for something while I was talking to other people. Then I text her about this thing and she texts me back. Then we kind of flirt (I've never flirt before so I don't know) and then we start texting back and forth more. I make some jokes and I think she is laughing (though it is texts Idk). Then I get more personal with her and I ask her a question (not about if she likes me in that way) and then it kind of ends there. Then the next day (which is yesterday rn), I feel super awkward and I feel like all the actions I did and she did that we found funny, were just annoying to her. I felt like I couldn't approach her and I just felt down that day. Then I text her a meme about the comp (basically saying how we shouldn't have won it). She leaves me on read. I go to sleep because I am so tired and then I have this dream. I feel like this whole dream is about my crush and I feel pathetic. I don't think she likes me anymore in the way I once though she might have, I think I am just like an aquantence at this point, and I feel like I am overanalyzing everything rn even though I told myself not to. I just feel lost and pathetic and I can't do anything except post about this weird ass dream that is making me feel this way. Btw, I also feel pathetic because instead of talking about this to someone I trust, I post this on reddit which is sad to me imo. Anyone have any thoughts about this? I don't know what to think or do about this dream and all I can think about right now is this dream, how I felt physical touch in the dream and I felt like my head moved, and about this girl I like and how she doesn't like me (which has happened twice before, so that doesn't really do much for confidence when it has gone on a roller coaster 3+ times).",0,weirdest dream feel pathetic af lmao weirdest dream day dream tell point know think bus school people knew class people use bus school raise red flag got stop somewhere away school even get raise red flag walking think school felt someone rest head shoulder walking person resting head shoulder girl like also holding hand think weird thing real life would blushing like moron emotional reaction except maybe slightly relaxing comforting feeling also sound like crush know recognize hair though never see face sound way high pitched real life raise red flag normalish conversation say hi say thing back start talking something swimsuit weird since know anything swimsuit oh well start talking swimsuit try respond best know anything swimsuit try ask question listen try change subject competition yesterday competition problem point say changing conversation listen something along line basically asking contribute conversation listen keep conversation going feel really embarrassed point also forgot mention still resting head shoulder point remember car driving road feel like driver seat think driving sometimes say whoah ran straight red light nearly missed car feel embarrassed apologize try tell know anything swimsuit really sorry like ok understand ok hold hand know true hold back kind like interlocking hand make sense kiss cheek really lightly right one reason even posting right felt real physically realistic dream never physical standpoint least remember kinda blush kiss cheek felt real af wake look empty space right try go phone see got text try something think feel pathetic context girl thought really liked messed around one day kept making laugh felt great kind dropped little asked something talking people text thing text back kind flirt never flirt know start texting back forth make joke think laughing though text idk get personal ask question like way kind end next day yesterday rn feel super awkward feel like action found funny annoying felt like approach felt day text meme comp basically saying leaf read go sleep tired dream feel like whole dream crush feel pathetic think like anymore way though might think like aquantence point feel like overanalyzing everything rn even though told feel lost pathetic anything except post weird as dream making feel way btw also feel pathetic instead talking someone trust post reddit sad imo anyone thought know think dream think right dream felt physical touch dream felt like head moved girl like like happened twice really much confidence gone roller coaster time
112,What is the weirdest dream you've ever had?,Dreams,"I was just mulling over one of the scariest and also weirdest dreams I ever had. I was a young teenager and I had a sister the same age as me. We shared a bunk bed. I was lying down on my bed, the bottom bunk, and I must have fallen asleep because that only explains what happened next. It was all dark in our room but the door slowly creaked open and a black figure I automatically assumed was my sister went across the room to the bunk bed ladder and I heard the creak of it as weight was distributed on it but I didn't hear the normal groaning of the mattress when she would lie down. I dreamed I was groggy so my eyes were halfway open (and there is even a pic of me sleeping with my eyes halfway open so this is also how I sleep apparently which is weird) and I remember saying ""Hi"" drowsily and then this voice replied ""hi"". I wasn't really with it but yeah. I'll explain shortly. So I asked my sister a favor (can't remember what it was) and the voice was exasperated and goes ""finneeee"" and I said ""you're the best sister ever"" followed with ""good night"" and suddenly the voice really caught my attention because I realized it sounded robotic as it went ""goODniGht"" super fast like it was trying to hurry up. Immediately my sister and my three brothers burst through my bedroom door because they had been messing around in the hallway outside. I sat up in my bed and felt sick to my stomach, pulled my sister inside my room and basically told her that something had been in her bed, talking to me as if it was her, but it wasn't. That's how vivid the dream was- I was fully convinced it had actually happened. I remember being so terrified to turn the lights out later that night and I talked to her about what happened for two hours. I didn't consider I had probably had a nightmare until years later. I'm really into skinwalker lore and I know one of their ""quirks"" is that they mimic voices of people you know and love to trick you. Obviously this wasn't a skinwalker but when I read about this stuff years later it definitely fit with what happened to me. I think what scares me the most is how every detail in my dream of my room was exactly the same. Usually when I dream something things are slightly distorted but this was not the case.

114,Is this a form of sleep paralysis where you can't open your eyes???,Dreams,"So for the past few months or so, I sometimes will get those weird dreams where I'm being cuddled/snuggled up by someone/something in my sleep?
I can't see shit because through the whole time, my eyes are closed, but I feel very sensitive (I will literally get flashes of images of what's going on... like limbs touching for example). Not only that but the dream (?) itself always guesses correctly in what position I'm at the exact moment.

It really bothers me because happened twice in a one night not long ago (last Tuesday).

What's even more bothering is that I don't even mind it at all because when it happens, I'm waaay too comfortable and relaxed to even bring myself to be bothered/scared/care about it... But I'm still confused by this.

I opened my eyes to a room, it had beige walls, the door was white with butterflies of pink and blue were painted on. I remember every detail but to save some time I'll just gloss over it. I went to the dresser and opened the drawer, I was shocked at the cold handle. It felt as if it was real and right in my hand. Inside the drawer was 6-9 dresses perfectly folded in place. The dresses on the left were silk well the dresses on the right were cotton or some fabric similar to cotton. I closed to drawer and went to what I think was a hope chest at the end of the bed. The wood also felt real and vivid. Inside was 2 silk dresses one pink and one purple I think, it was dark. There was a jar of dead moths and butterflies, a locket and some candles. Once I closed the chest I heard 3 aggressive knocks and I woke up in a panic before immediately writing down this dream. It's by far one of my most interesting dreams.

I’ve been single my whole life, never even had a kissed. I’m a good looking guy, and have had many dates but haven’t had the feeling of really truly liking any of them. 

2 days ago, I was facing some problems in school and was pretty distraught. This girl A was really nice and she helped me out. I always thought of her as nice but not physically attractive. But she really made an impact on me that day.

Yesterday, I attended a school event and saw another girl B. I had never previously considered girl B attractive but wow after just talking to her I found myself being attracted to her. I was just waiting, looking for her the entire event. Felt really nice to feel that way about someone again.

Last night, I had a dream that I was in bed with girl B and when I started kissing her she suddenly became girl A. It was so vivid and I could feel the kiss. I continued to kiss her neck, body and she was so into it. Suddenly, she cummed so much but it was this brownish fluid that reminded me of diarrhea. I literally puked a little in the dream and was fighting for every excuse to wake up.

     Whenever she saw us walking, she’d take him from me. And well, he’d go with it and leave me just like that. It was embarrassing. The fact that it happened every so often was no help either. Whenever she was around there was no point in walking with him. He just left me right there for her. What bothered me even more was how I was a second option for him to walk with whenever she wasn’t there. He claims he never had a crush on her but just thought she was cute.
     Funny because he claimed freshman year to have feelings for me. Yet he dipped on me so many times for a girl he called cute. That’s where i get annoyed. Sophomore year she’d stare at me. A lot. I don’t know why. When I told my boyfriend about it, he came right to her defense. This isn’t the first time he’s defended a girl who’d stare at me too much or turn fake on me. He did that to me for his x crush(F16).
     Now this year, Junior year, he has the same science class as her. He didn’t tell me. See she went to be fake and not even notice him in the class until the second week going, “is (won’t say names for privacy) in this class?”. He ignored her. I don’t know why but it kind of relieves me cause that means she knows she’ll be embarrassed and ignored not to take him from me anymore. 
      I also have ap English with this girl. What I’ve noticed a lot about her being in my class is how she’s trying to take MY GUY FRIEND FROM ME TOO. How much she goes for guys attentions. Bending over and everything. Who does that? I told him about it and how it seems like she seeks guys attention and HE DEFENDS HER. AGAIN. 
      Now for the dream. It started off sweet. It was me cuddling my boyfriend having random conversations about anything. Then the next day, we went to school. I’m walking with him at first. The school looks different but that’s not the point. That pumpkin comes in and stole him from me. This time he puts his arm around her. I slap him and ask him why he would do that. Then he defends himself on some “I wouldn’t leave you for a ginger cow”. Well you just did. Then he’s all following me to class trying to apologize. I just want an interpretation of the dream. Does it mean that, this is to come? I hope not.

121,Jumble sales.,Dreams,"First a jumble sale was being organised, one that they apparently have regularly.  It was so early in the morning that it was still almost dark.  One of the sellers told me that they pay £5000 for a table, for which they get back a £400 cash float in change so they have change to give their customers.  IIRC she told me that she thought £5000 for a table was too steep as she often doesn't break even.

Then I was a seller at a jumble sale, laying my unwanted items (mainly CDs, DVDs and towels, I think) on a table to sell.  But then more sellers came and many of us were expected to share one table, so I had to cram all my stuff together in a small space.  I realised that one of the old towels I was trying to sell had a dirty mark on it from where my dog had wiped her nose on it and I was worried that it might put buyers off.  But one of the other sellers said they thought it was worth more than I was charging.  I think I was planning to charge £4 for it but the other seller said it was worth around £11.  

One of the other sellers started crying.  He told me that his girlfriend Shereen (a family friend of mine IRL) had been swimming somewhere dangerous and had been swept away and drowned.  I remember thinking that she'd always been reckless and it was just a matter of time before something like this happened.

Then I was a mother with kids, planning to move to a home nearer my kids' school.

122,Plane Crash,Dreams,I rarely have nightmares anymore but two nights ago I dreamt I was in public and I noticed an airplane flying awfully low. It then took a nosedive and hit a building.

123,A Tale of Two Good Friends,Dreams,"This might be unusual since this dream needs some context for it to be understood, as it actually is a continuation of an event that happened just 2 hours before I slept and had this dream. So here goes.

Just yesterday I went to a club with a group of people I met at a birthday party. Among them were two girls, let‘s call them Jeanette and Therese. Both are really close friends and have been so for years, but their personalities are nothing but totally different. Jeanette is very carefree, loud, somewhat childish and really likes hanging around people, whereas Therese is calm, soft-spoken, obviously the more grownup of the two and only hangs around the 2 or 3 select people. 
Not 15 minutes when we were dancing in the club, Jeanette had already been dancing and making out with a random guy (who wasn‘t from out group) and a few minutes after this she told Therese that she would be going to this guy’s place and she unilaterally canceled all plans that they‘d made for the next day. Feeling sorry for Therese, I actually walked her back home and tried my best to comfort her as best I could, as she was totally pissed off by Jeanette‘s attitude towards her best friend.
Fast forward to my dream, it began as Jeanette was just about to go out when our group decided to go outside and go to the two busses which was apparently waiting for us. Surprise surprise, Jeanette and the guy were in the other bus as Therese, who was sitting just beside me, constantly complained about Jeanette. 
From our bus, we could see that the other bus has a much more... shall we say, 'promiscuous' atmosphere than the bus I was in, which didn‘t help since Therese was already visibly furious. But I still kept on comforting her as best as I could and it seemed to have helped her somewhat.
We finally arrived to our destination; a much bigger, much fancier club than we went to. We went in soon after and we were greeted by the sound of ""I can‘t feel my face"" by The Weeknd, sung by... me, apparently. What happened was that The Weeknd gave me a microphone and asked me to sing with him. I gave it a go and it went surprisingly well. Everyone‘s happy, including Therese, who was still beside me as I finished singing. At this point, Jeanette was nowhere to be found and we decided to walk back home.
The sun was rising as we arrived to Therese‘s place, which apparently was next to my apartment (irl it was actually on the other side of the city). We said our goodbyes and she went inside. I crossed a bridge that led to my apartment. I saw the sunrise as I was crossing the bridge when I immediately woke up.
I don‘t know what happened to either Therese or Jeanette as we didn‘t exchange contacts, but I just hope that both of them have now reconciled from this particular problem.

One thing that I noticed is how very vivid this dream was. I‘m trained in lucid dreaming and this was the one time since a long time ago that I couldn‘t notice that I was actually in a dream. I was quite freaked out when I woke up.",0,tale two good friend might unusual since dream need context understood actually continuation event happened hour slept dream go yesterday went club group people met birthday party among two girl let call jeanette therese really close friend year personality nothing totally different jeanette carefree loud somewhat childish really like hanging around people whereas therese calm soft spoken obviously grownup two hang around select people minute dancing club jeanette already dancing making random guy group minute told therese would going guy place unilaterally canceled plan made next day feeling sorry therese actually walked back home tried best comfort best could totally pissed jeanette attitude towards best friend fast forward dream began jeanette go group decided go outside go two bus apparently waiting u surprise surprise jeanette guy bus therese sitting beside constantly complained jeanette bus could see bus much shall say promiscuous atmosphere bus help since therese already visibly furious still kept comforting best could seemed helped somewhat finally arrived destination much bigger much fancier club went went soon greeted sound feel face weeknd sung apparently happened weeknd gave microphone asked sing gave go went surprisingly well everyone happy including therese still beside finished singing point jeanette nowhere found decided walk back home sun rising arrived therese place apparently next apartment irl actually side city said goodbye went inside crossed bridge led apartment saw sunrise crossing bridge immediately woke know happened either therese jeanette exchange contact hope reconciled particular problem one thing noticed vivid dream trained lucid dreaming one time since long time ago notice actually dream quite freaked woke
124,Vivid dreams,Dreams,"My dreams aren’t crazy- nothing un-realistic. Sometimes oddly simple,  but so vivid that I think about them constantly (not actually constantly but whenever my mind wanders) while awake. I can remember my dream from 3-5 nights ago just as if it happened 20 minutes ago. And then they stack upon each other, so I have a weeks worth of dreams floating in my head at a time. And I can recall them for much longer than that- just curious if anyone else does this or is something going on in my head? Not that I think anything is mentally wrong with me just strange. 
I did have a reoccurring dream as a child for awhile that I still remember (30 now) and I can remember singular dreams very vividly from as much as about 8 years ago.

125,So far I’ve never heard another ’teeth’ dream like the ones I have and idk what it means,Dreams,So we’ve all heard about ‘teeth’ dreams. In most circumstances you hear that people have dreams of their teeth straight up falling out or crumbling to dust or even shrinking but I haven’t really heard any like mine. Usually I’m talking to someone I know and that’s close to me and as I am conversing I start pulling my teeth out of my mouth bit by bit one by one. I’ve had another dream where I went so far as to cut back my gums and pull out my jawbone. Lastly the only other teeth dream I’ve had is one where in I ate my own teeth. Chewed pieces of them like candy and ate them. I’m not sure what these mean? If you have any input I’d be glad to hear it. :D,0,far never heard another teeth dream like one idk mean heard teeth dream circumstance hear people dream teeth straight falling crumbling dust even shrinking really heard like mine usually talking someone know close conversing start pulling teeth mouth bit bit one one another dream went far cut back gum pull jawbone lastly teeth dream one ate teeth chewed piece like candy ate sure mean input glad hear
126,Ninja turtles are the only ones that remember me,Dreams,"This is hella embarrassing, but like, I need answers.

I've had about 3-4 dreams of the Ninja turtles in the last 5 years. In each one they have saved and protected me, and they're the only ones that have appeared in my dreams more than once and who have remembered me and remembered being in my dreams.

I've always loved the turtles, ever since I first watched the 90's cartoon as a kid. And I've been watching the cartoons and movies ever since, even going as far as buying the OG comics.

I've felt a huge familial connection with them in those dreams, and when they do appear in my dreams, it's always to save me, and then my dream feels warm and comforting, as apposed to my usual nightmares. I often look forward to when I have another dream with them in it. They usually greet me like, ""Hey Betta! Having a bad dream again huh?""

Even the first time they appeared in my dreams, they acted like I literally summoned them out of their dimension. They introduced themselves and asked me what was going on, and who I was and where they were. It was bizarre.

But the last dream I had with them, was really sad for me, I was so happy to see them cus I've been having a hard time and I really just wanted that comforting feeling to wake up to. I said hi to them and asked how they've been, and they seemed confused, they asked me who I was, and I was really distraught.

They had forgotten me. When I woke up I legitimately felt like I wanted to cry. It's so dumb because they're not real and it's stupid to feel so connected to fictional characters, but it was like a safe space to me.

I can't bring myself to look at anything ninja turtle related anymore, it makes me sad. And I worry that if I have another dream with them in it, that it'll just hurt because what if they don't remember me again?

So, my question is, what the heck is up with that? Why am I so attached to them, why were they the only ones to remember me and remember being in my dreams, and why did they forget me?",0,ninja turtle one remember hella embarrassing like need answer dream ninja turtle last year one saved protected one appeared dream remembered remembered dream always loved turtle ever since first watched cartoon kid watching cartoon movie ever since even going far buying og comic felt huge familial connection dream appear dream always save dream feel warm comforting apposed usual nightmare often look forward another dream usually greet like hey betta bad dream huh even first time appeared dream acted like literally summoned dimension introduced asked going bizarre last dream really sad happy see cu hard time really wanted comforting feeling wake said hi asked seemed confused asked really distraught forgotten woke legitimately felt like wanted cry dumb real stupid feel connected fictional character like safe space bring look anything ninja turtle related anymore make sad worry another dream hurt remember question heck attached one remember remember dream forget

I grabbed him, trying to get my phone back. After that, he pulls a knife on me and tries to slash open my arm.

129,Do dreams correlate to real life?,Dreams,"So I was drunk last night (unfortunately I don't remember dreams all that much for whatever reason but I vividly remember my drunk ones). I fell asleep and woke up in the same room scrolling on my phone through reddit (morning ritual). I look over and theres a girl in the room sitting there. She looks at me and after a bit comes closer, throws my phone to the side and starts making out with me. I was grabbing this chick by her ass and I felt like I could feel everything like real life. We heard a noise and she said she needed to leave (at which point I could see some light shining through the windows, my light was on in the room so maybe that's why?). She leaves, I sit there and then quickly wake up to it being 6am. Anybody know what this means?

131,First dream in a long time,Dreams,"I usually don’t dream so this one was quite surprising.

There was a hurricane in my city (we never get hurricanes) and I started driving off with my brother and dad, no matter which way we went we could never lose it. Eventually our car broke down in a plaza and the hurricane took us alive.

I wake up and I find nothing but collapsed buildings and rubble, my whole body was covered in bruises, but somehow I had survived. I decided to walk around for a bit, judging by the heavy fog and the peacefulness of the dawn sky, I decided it was okay. 

For some reason I decided to start looking for food and money, so I started climbing in vents?? I couldn’t control what was happening anyway, it felt like a video player was being presented in front of my mind. While trying to stay positive and ignoring the animatronic heads here and there, I managed to find $5 in a pouch, as well as a can of beans. I decided to look for my brother and dad, still inside the rumble of collapsed buildings what used to be a plaza. After a whole day of crawling I found nobody, as assumed that neither survived the hurricane. I sleep in the rumble for the night hungry, thirsty and tired, using the pouch of money as a pillow.

I wake up the next day (still in my dream) and find the plaza to be back to normal, and there were... people? I looked at myself, still with bruises, except I wasn’t hungry nor thirsty, I couldn’t feel anything. Anyway, I decided to get up and walk around, I was sleeping on the side of a fancy restaurant.

132,Home invasion dream,Dreams,"I was running through a ghetto neighborhood that I lived in for some reason. 

All of a sudden, some dudes dog was sprinting towards me and then stopped at the last second when the owner said stop... it was clearly very well trained. The owner laughed about it almost attacking me. Then, he just walked with me towards my home and we talked.

There was some small talk. Again, we were in the ghetto and I remember some graffiti being all over the walls in the neighborhood.  I told him nice to meet you and take it easy, then headed in. As I walked through the unlocked front door, I looked behind me and saw him a couple feet away still. He was in the process of reaching behind him and pulling out a gun. 


I yelled “we’re getting robbed by gun point” to my dad and brother, who were both inside at the dinner table. I quickly shut and locked the door... waiting next to it for the inevitable. My family questioned me in a panic. “are you serious?” as they made a ruckus to hide/find a weapon. The man shot the lock, and made his way in. I tried to surprise him as he stepped in and grab the gun, but he just aimed it at center mass instantly and shot me really fast one time. 

I fell to the floor. He kept making his way through the home. Somehow, I pushed through the shock/pain of getting shot, got up, and grabbed the gun from him. I went to shoot, it didn’t work. I cocked it, pulled the trigger, and then it let off a powerful bang. I cocked and shot him like 4 times after that. A couple in the back, and one to his head, killing him. 

My family was proud of me.... and all I could think about was my injury, telling them “I’m dead still. I’m a goner.”

Then I woke up.

137,Does my dream symbolize anything? (told in a story format) *no real names used*,Dreams,"I was walking down a path in a gloomy forest heading towards a school Halloween party. I was walking with my friend, Kay. While we were approaching the party (we could see it from where we were walking), a small group of people emerge from the shadows. They were aged between 15-50. A guy in the front, whose hair was brown and had lots of volume, says to me and my friend, ""Where do you think you're going? Think you can go see your friends without paying us something?"" I look over at Kay, a confused look plastered across my face. The man laughs. ""What? Don't tell me you didn't know there was a cost?"" He says. He looks over at the rest of his group members, each of them nodding back. They start throwing rocks at Kay and me, painting bruises and cuts all over the two of us. I grit my teeth and pick up one of the rocks that fell to the ground after hitting me, aiming it for one of the older men. It hits his head, and he falls to the ground dead. While the rest of the group stands there in shock staring at the man, Kay and I take the opportunity to rush to the party. The other people at the party had been watching. A girl in my class (whom I quite despise) approaches me. Her name is Lynn. ""Wow. Killing a man in cold bold? That's pretty cruel, Laura,"" she hisses. I jump at her, hitting her and pulling her hair. I'm on her in such a way it looks like a backwards piggy-back ride. I'm crying and screaming hysterically. ""You don't get it! You don't understand! It's not fair! He was trying to kill me!"" I keep screaming and crying until someone pulls me off. The other people there take my side, to my delight (and surprise). Saying it was okay because Kay and I would have died had I not done something. It was self-defense. At least I thought. It was becoming hazy by now. Then my face went cold. The man I killed had twin sons. They were my friends, too. How would I explain that to them? I look over and see Andy (one of his sons) entering the party. He notices me and smiles. He walks over to me joyfully. The look on his face is describable. He was so happy. The look still haunts me. The pure happiness I was about to shatter. ""Have you seen my dad? I'm supposed to check in with him to let him know I'm here,"" he says happily. A tear falls down my face. ""He's dead,"" I respond, my voice cracking. His smile shatters to a million pieces. ""He's what?"" He asks, looking at me in the eyes. ""He's dead,"" I repeat flatly. I could almost hear his heart breaking. I break eye contact, seeing his twin, Sam, approaching us. ""Hey, Andy-man! You seen dad anywhere? He ain't picking up his phone!"" Sam laughs. Andy looks down, a tear falling from his eye. ""Dad's dead,"" Andy's voice breaks. Andy starts to cry and I bring him into a hug. Sam's face had turned to stone, his happy look fading.

138,What is that strange shadow looming over me?,Dreams,"So this did not occur to me while I was asleep but rather when I was waking up.I was waking up from a nightmare and then i saw the figure of a black cat jump over my head or rather something dark.
This was not a dream or hallucination I felt the sensation and heard the sound.
I woke up and checked my room and there was nothing and there was no way my cat could have entered since my room was locked. I always feel some sort of sensation like something is there along with me.
And at night I would hear things dropping on the floor like a soft thud or hear my chair creak as if someone is getting up or sitting on it and no I checked and there was no way it would creak by itself.
When I wake up my lights would be closed or open depending on how I left it the previous night I think that could be me but I'm not sure( I don't remember waking up to change it)
I constantly get nightmares and I feel something looming over me until I saw the dark figure jump over my head

What could this be or am I just thinking too much into this?
I don't think this could be a sleep disorder.
What should I do?

139,Dreaming of the same place that I've never been to or seen when I'm awake,Dreams,"So I've noticed that there are at least three different locations that I feel like I've been in before but I've never seen them before in real life when I dream. One area is out in a prairie in a small neighborhood. The house that I always end up in when I'm in the area feels like it's owned by an old grandma though I've never seen her and there's a large rodeo arena. 

The second area is another is like a historic down town area. Small shops, old welkept houses, and kinda packed in together. I can't really describe that one much because it's very blurry and I only remember it well just after I wake up 

Third one is a forest with a semi large house, a pretty river, and many cottages. Normally in this dream, I'm connected with the animals. When I first had this dream, i was running away from something with my grandma (we even ended up crashing her van that we were suddenly in). Bow whenever I'm back in that forest, it's peaceful and has a slight glow in it.

Looking back though, the start of all the familiar dream worlds starts with me running away from something. In the first one,  I was running away from a man with another female that I don't know. I was able to confront him and scared him off once we reached the rodeo grounds. The second one I was running away from a dark mass and then one moment it just didn't show up anymore. And the third one, my grandma and I was running away from the large house. That stopped once we reached the river and one of the small cottages that we fixed up. Now my grandma doesn't show up much often in that dream. It's normally me and the animals (no my grandma isn't dead either).

140,I’m either being haunted by succubes or my subconscious is a bully,Dreams,"So, I’m posting this cause this things have been happening very often and it has bothered me a lot. I’m diagnosed with dysthymia and one of the main symptoms I have is hypersomnia.
Hypersomnia episodes affect all aspects of the life of a dysthimic/depressed person, often times I would find myself not having the energy to even open my eyes and sit in bed, and during crises of depression it would make me feel even worse as I would lose half the day in bed.

A couples of months ago I was just chilling watching youtube and I came across a vídeo talking about incubus and succubes, which are basically vampiristic creatures that suck your life and energy through sexual dreams. The way I related to that was by the way I felt after hypersomnia attacks, completely out of energy, lifeless and feeling no reason to go on about my day; I’ve also felt like I was literally physically fighting to wake up, as I would struggle to even open my eyes and sometimes I would get to sit in bed just to feel like I was being pushed down again and then instantly fall asleep dreaming that I was getting ready, or showering.

I’ve always been very skeptical towards everything but I can’t deny that there are things out there we can’t understand. Anyways, the “supernatural” part comes now I guess.

I’ve often dreamed about flirting, finding a date or being around people that I’ve been in love with in the past. I’m not much of a H word person, mainly because of depression and stuff, but some of these dreams tend to come up a lot of times also. The thing that stands out for me though is that i’ve been actually able to hear sentences and bits of conversations in my dreams, not related to them, and that didn’t leak from something that was going on in the room (you know?! like when you dream about the tv audio or something like that). Once while I was trying to move my fingers and lift my arm during a hipersomnia crises I’ve actually been able to hear a commotion and someone saying “Don’t let her go!” in my head, but I WASN’T DREAMING ANYMORE I was just in the state of paralysis!!

So, do you think my brain is playing tricks on me or do you believe there are actually supernatural beings out there that feed on us?

In my dream, I was at a friend's house. (He and I were friends all through school, from third grade until graduation. We did once go on a ""date"" but decided it would be better to stay friends. We have completely lost touch since graduation. I am a 28 year old woman that is petrified of heights, and have been married almost a decade, just for some quick background.) After what seemed like a fun night of hanging out and listening to music, I started to feel very uncomfortable and wanted to leave. The front door was locked, and I didn't want to upset my friend by letting him know that I was ready to go, as he had already made up the guest room for me. I went to the room and locked the door behind me. I could hear him coming up the stairs, and felt so frightened that I opened the closet to hide. When I opened the closet, I saw that there was a ledge looking over darkness. I could hear him trying to open the door to the guest room, so I jumped into the abyss. I was tumbling/rolling head over heels on what looked like a net or web. There was nothing for me to grab onto to catch myself, so I just kept going. I was feeling very dizzy. 

And that's when I woke up!

I slow motion dodged around it and managed to get back inside and close the door.  I heard the lion tearing into the kids and the guy.  I turned around again and the store was completely empty.

147,Is this a stage of sleep?,Dreams,"Hi guys, really not sure what the best place to write this in but I think this is ok for this sub, sorry if not. 
Basically when I go to sleep at night, before I even begin to drift off I have this very strange 'vision' thing. It's only happened twice, the first one happened when I was listening to the podcast I listen to every night, it was like what i assume an acid trip is like, I was actually in the main guy of the podcasts mind, it was very real and scary I was quiet uncomfortable so I kinda shook myself out of it. 
The second one was last night, I was in my vision and it was like I entered a different world and it was so strange but I understood it, it was like I was in a different world, both times I was pretty awake so I don't think it was a dream, both times were quiet scary and it's never happened before, the only thing I can think of is when I've just woken up from sleep or dozing off I can make up quiet a few veres of songs really quickly, which is odd as I am not musical and i struggle to make a poem rhyme!
I'm not thinking this is anything supernatural I'm just asking for peoples opinions, and maybe it's worth mentioning that I go to therapy 3 times a week so I do feel alot (maybe that adds?) And I  on meds but have been for 4 years and there's never been any side effects. 
Oh and i spoke to a women I know who said that's (that time before you sleep or just wake up) is the freest place in a human but she's all I to witches and stuff so don't really accept her opinions on everything...
Would love to hear your thoughts.

148,My brain taught me how to wake up after a painful dream where I died.,Dreams,"So this started with a dream I had back in 2012 during my high school years. I still remember it clearly since it was the only dream that gave me pain when I woke up.

So the dream scenario started with a takeover invasion of earth by machine aliens, and with them succeeding. I was looking for a job at that time, and was desperate so I applied at the internal security department of the alien force. I was accepted and designated as a conspirator. As years passed, I was promoted to the head of internal security. However, a fierce revolution erupted shortly after, with people all over the world overpowering the invaders. The office compound was soon overran by the rebels. I fought hard but was soon captured and brought outside, surrounded by them. I was then executed by a pistol to my forehead. The end of my dream.

Upon waking up, I had difficulty moving accompained with twitching pain at the back of my head. This went on for less than a minute. 

I think this happened because my brain didn't know the feeling of death/gunshot to the head. That's why I twitched maybe? I had a couple of dreams where I drowned to death before that one, but I think it wasn't that straightforward compared to this one.

Soon after this dream I learned to wake up at command when I'm in dire situations. It had something to do with talking musical notes teaching me this emergency move lol, my brain don't want that pain no more.",0,brain taught wake painful dream died started dream back high school year still remember clearly since dream gave pain woke dream scenario started takeover invasion earth machine alien succeeding looking job time desperate applied internal security department alien force accepted designated conspirator year passed promoted head internal security however fierce revolution erupted shortly people world overpowering invader office compound soon overran rebel fought hard soon captured brought outside surrounded executed pistol forehead end dream upon waking difficulty moving accompained twitching pain back head went le minute think happened brain know feeling death gunshot head twitched maybe couple dream drowned death one think straightforward compared one soon dream learned wake command dire situation something talking musical note teaching emergency move lol brain want pain

150,a hurtful dream,Dreams,"I had a dream that we were laying and snuggling in a sunkissed wheat field.. You looked into my eyes but your mind was somewhere else. You said, ‘I should leave, I’m going to be late for my wedding’. I looked at you with hurt in my eyes but knowing in my soul. ‘you have a wife.’ You respond ‘yes, I do.’ You left. I was angry and sad, though I knew this already, you’d ripped my heart open in confirming my suspicions. It felt like my world had fell apart...  there were tears streaming down my face. I flew away from you, an angel using the sky as a canvas for my tears. I sprayed red spaint into the sky so you could see me, to show you I’m hurt and to remind you I still exist before you were gone out of sight after discarding me, but the lines kept fading and no matter how dramatic they were, you didnt notice me. In the distance I saw someone painting yellow lines into the sky. My heart came alive with pure rage combined with comfort and grief. I thought it was you and I went to check even though my gut said it wasn’t. My gut was right. It was some random people having fun with paint.

I had nowhere to go so I went back to school. I was still crying and I knew how ridiculous I looked, but I went 'fuck it'. Fuck it not because I don't care, fuck it because nobody else does. People hide this kind of raw emotion in vain. Besides nobody could ever understand the pain I was in if I explained it, and predictably none of them cared anyway. As always even when I'm not bawling my eyes out in front of them, it felt like there is this wall between me and them. A wall of shame. I half expected someone to come and comfort me being the idealist I am, but instead people made fun of me. Some did worse, they tried to 'fix' me. Ingenuous pieces of shit. So I was just alone crying in the corner having my very own pity party.

Dreams like these make me wish I’d never gotten involved with boys at all, let alone you.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I'm only 15 and I've already been betrayed so many times in love, it's dampened my spirit.

I have a lot of dreams like this and they haunt me.

 I don't believe it when people say things... anything. I feel like people are always lying to me. I hate it and I'm mad, boiling with hatred really, that so many have taken advantage of me. I'm a really sensitive empathetic and kind person and I know that and so did they. The first one took advantage of my body and naive wonder, another created a fairytale land for us to share and had me completely in love with him, but then left with the coldest most hurtful, rude energy and no real explanation. The next guy promised to help me through the pain and be my lover and my best friend simultaneously, but he left me for work. Really, he had someone else all along and was cheating with me. Then there was this guy... I guess he did nothing wrong, it just wasn't meant to be and he was afraid because I was more experienced than him. I'm still on good terms with him and that makes my heart warm, he rides his bike around after school and says hi to me. Although, he did also make promises and present sentiments and tales of 'forever'. I'll let him off the hook though just because hes a cute lil munchkin. Next guy, well we didnt date but he was a fuckboy. Now now, usually I have a very great fuckboy radar and I could tell this guy was like that so it's on me, but there was something about him that was very creative and etherical and innovative. Otherworldly. He was different to all of the douchebags he associated himself with and I don't know if he knew that. I found him so mesmerizing. He was such a gentleman to me and treated me like a lady. He sent me red hearts and we exchanged sweet kisses, but I was soon to face the reality of his fear of commitment. I told him I liked him and he said he liked me as a friend. I was all 'what the fuck, man?' and that's how it ends.

This has become a rhyme because I don't wanna waste your time, with a boring little whine. I think all of these hurts were lessons from our lovely universe. To trust my gut and not submit to thirst. To not be seduced by those who are aloof. To recognize the liar before the serotonin levels shot any higher.

Trust your gut people.

There was a huge fireball that hit some power lines and everything went dark, so my mom and I left the car, but my dad was nowhere to be seen.

We went inside a building where I killed them all to protect my mom, and their mob boss or whoever congratulated me, invited us into her house, and offered us relaxation. There was a small pond and I sat by it in a wicker chair of sorts, bending water for fun. I tried doing more advanced stuff, but it wasn’t working out for me. Moved on to doing that airball seat trick that Aang did at times. We were on a balcony overlooking a large mountain, so I called over this mob boss’s kids and told them to watch me. I gestured for the mountain to rise, but nothing happened, and the kids started getting bored. But once I got it, it was amazing. That mountain probably gave Everest a run for its money.

I don’t really remember too many of the details, but i clearly remember being at a relatives house and then going in their back yard. Two black cats with a third eye both came up to me and grew very fond of me and i grew fond of them. They were both normal cats, the only difference was that they both had a third eye on their forehead. They began following me around and i grew very attached to the both of them. Later on in the dream, I came across a completely black goat that could speak. It was very friendly and i didn’t really think much of it when i was dreaming, but now that i am awake i can’t really stop thinking about it. Kinda reminds me of the black goat from the movie “the witch”. That is all i really remember from the dream. Am I worried for no reason about this dream?

167,The Face Stealer,Dreams,"Oct 12 2019

I'm in a middle school. But I was confused because I'm not a middle schooler. The announcement said 3rd period is starting and all the kids are rushing. But I saw something standing in the middle of the hallway. 

It looks like a tall person. Wearing a black outfit. A long trench coat, boots, a hat. The only thing missing is a head. The hat is just floating in mid air.

A kid bumped into this tall headless person. It grabbed the kid by the face, lifted him up in the air and the dropped him. The kid got up. But he doesn't have a face anymore. 

All the kids screamed and started running to their classes. The headless monster saw me just standing a couple feet away so it tried to grab me. But a witch outfit appeared onto my body and a wand in my hand. I blasted its hand away. I then ran into a gym and closed the door. 

Once I entered the gym my witch outfit disappeared and back to normal clothes. The gym was having a talent competition. 2 handsome brothers got up on stage. They look like grown adults. One of them is holding a guitar. They said they wrote a song to their friend. They told a story about meeting a beautiful girl. They both fell in love with her. She doesn't want the 2 brothers to fight each other for her so she decided to hang out with her separately. But one day she can no longer hang out with them because she's going home. They were in a forest at night and she took her clothes off. 

Underneath showed glowing clothes, looks like it dates back to ancient Egypt. She told them she's actually a goddess. Her spaceship arrives, inside was a modern looking bar with a motorcycle next to it. She hopped on and the spaceship closes its doors and flew away. 

The brothers said that was in the 1970s. I was confused even more. How old are you two and why are you in a school talent show? The next is a boy with his pants drooping. He started dancing but then grabbed a girl and said would you go to the dance with me. And everyone cheered. 

I got bored and opened the door and I saw the headless monster going down this hallway. I was about to close the door but the monster pushed through. Everyone started running away. My witch outfit appeared again. I ran into a storage room. Inside is another girl. She have brown skin and hair, also wearing emo clothing. She shushed me, because I ran in with too much noise.

It's a very crammed storage room. I had to move very slowly because I might bump into something and it's going to be very loud. There's a hole at the bottom of the wall. I crouched down and took a peek. It's another room, I think the bathroom. Other kids are hiding in there.

We heard movements. A very heavy and slow walking sound near the door. I pulled out my wand and whispered to the girl, I'm going to put a invisible mask on us so it won't take our faces. She nodded. I waved my wand in a small circle and started forming a mask. I told her to close her eyes. I closed mine too. 

The door opened. A slow thumping noise approaches. There was a tapping noise on the girl's head. I took a peek, it's the monster. The girl's eyes twitched, looks like she wanted to open her eyes. But I grabbed her head and put it on my chest so the monster won't get her face. 

The monster grabbed my face, but then a loud noise came from the bathroom. The monster lets go of my face and walked over to the wall. I looked over and it punched a hole in the way. There's a lot of frightened looking kids in the bathroom. 

My plan was to trick the monster for taking our faces and then leave. But now more kids are in danger. I pointed my wand at the monster and started blasting spells. But the spells bounced right off. It turned around and grabbed me by the neck. And pinned me to the wall. 

I looked at it and saw a face. It looks like a young man's face. I aimed my wand at the face and blasted magic. The monster screamed and lets me go. I yelled out nine circles of hell and powerful flames burst out of my wand into the monster's face. I yelled at the kids saying everyone get the fuck out of here. I then started the seven heavens and the monster was blinded. 

Even though its blinded, monster was fast and blocked the door. I yelled out belphagor's sloth at the monster. The monster fell to the floor and started moving really slow. I grabbed the monster not letting it go and yelled at the kids to run. They all started running around the door. Only the monster and I are in the room. 

My dreams ends there. I'm not religious at all, I just like reading mythology and legends so maybe that's why the spells are called devils and heaven.",0,face stealer oct middle school confused middle schooler announcement said rd period starting kid rushing saw something standing middle hallway look like tall person wearing black outfit long trench coat boot hat thing missing head hat floating mid air kid bumped tall headless person grabbed kid face lifted air dropped kid got face anymore kid screamed started running class headless monster saw standing couple foot away tried grab witch outfit appeared onto body wand hand blasted hand away ran gym closed door entered gym witch outfit disappeared back normal clothes gym talent competition handsome brother got stage look like grown adult one holding guitar said wrote song friend told story meeting beautiful girl fell love want brother fight decided hang separately one day longer hang going home forest night took clothes underneath showed glowing clothes look like date back ancient egypt told actually goddess spaceship arrives inside modern looking bar motorcycle next hopped spaceship close door flew away brother said confused even old two school talent show next boy pant drooping started dancing grabbed girl said would go dance everyone cheered got bored opened door saw headless monster going hallway close door monster pushed everyone started running away witch outfit appeared ran storage room inside another girl brown skin hair also wearing emo clothing shushed ran much noise crammed storage room move slowly might bump something going loud hole bottom wall crouched took peek another room think bathroom kid hiding heard movement heavy slow walking sound near door pulled wand whispered girl going put invisible mask u take face nodded waved wand small circle started forming mask told close eye closed mine door opened slow thumping noise approach tapping noise girl head took peek monster girl eye twitched look like wanted open eye grabbed head put chest monster get face monster grabbed face loud noise came bathroom monster let go face walked wall looked punched hole way lot frightened looking kid bathroom plan trick monster taking face leave kid danger pointed wand monster started blasting spell spell bounced right turned around grabbed neck pinned wall looked saw face look like young man face aimed wand face blasted magic monster screamed let go yelled nine circle hell powerful flame burst wand monster face yelled kid saying everyone get fuck started seven heaven monster blinded even though blinded monster fast blocked door yelled belphagor sloth monster monster fell floor started moving really slow grabbed monster letting go yelled kid run started running around door monster room dream end religious like reading mythology legend maybe spell called devil heaven

170,"multiple dream ive had that i still remember vividly (names have been changed, but are ppl ik irl)",Dreams,"(srry its so long)
i just copied and pasted from my notes

key: 

rayburn- high school

names- ppl ik irl


-  so this one was back in rayburn. a kid was the principal n he ran the place. he kept everyone in line by having 2 velociraptors in a cage by his desk in his office n threatened to release them into the school if anyone broke any rules. so needless to say everyone was perfect students from fear of being eaten by raptors. hed reenforce this every morning by letting the kids hear the raptors screech into the microphone during announcements.

- so this gamer guy had the bright idea of putting his microwave nxt to his pc so he didnt have to get up while playing overwatch, he turns the microwave on to make some food n then all hell breaks loose, the microwave caused the pc to malfunction and all his game characters in all his games became real and they all lived in the house with him, i remember tracer from overwatch very clearly running around the house all fast cleanin n cookin n i knocked on the front door n doomfist fuckin answers the door n CARRIES me with one hand (i was sitting in his hand like a tiny chihuahua) to the couch to hang with 'the fam' lol tracer wanted to have a dance party so we all partied with her then i woke up.....wtf even is my brain.....

- ok so this one was a long one. i was at a house with ray n some guy who looked familiar but idk who tf he was. the front door opened up to the living room where ray was layin on the couch on his phone then you'd go through a door that turned into like a walk-in hallway closet situation then through that to another door on the end that went into a bedroom where the guy was hangin out. it started like i was in the bedroom with the guy hangin n smokin n i heard someone start to bang on the door. when i open the door 3 zombies try to push their way inside n im tiny n weak but still trying my damndest not to get bit. im wrestling with these zombies while the weird dude just smokes on the bed like nuthing is going on n im screamin for him to help but its like he dsnt hear me. after like 30 mins of fighting a losing battle the zombies start to laugh n ray comes through the door laughin too. it was a fuckin prank to fuck with me n im pissed. when i cool down i go throigh the hallway closet thing into the living room where i cnt believe whos hanging out on the couch. a bunch of celebrities and jason are sitting there waiting to surprise me (adam sandler, jack black, evan peters, beyonce, rihanna, that main beardy white guy from stranger things n some i dnt remember their names but i know their faces). im like omfg what are u guys doing here (i guess im friends with all the celebrities). i hug them all n ask hows it going n ray is nowhere to be seen. im like 'rays gotta see this or he'll never believe me' so i run out front to find him. hes gone. neighbor says she saw him drive away, she dsnt know where he went or if hes comin back for me so im like well fuck. i go back inside n hang with my celeb friends n wait for ray to come back. then i woke up. idk wtf is wrong with my brain but it felt so real i woke up like OoO bc i pretty much had to force myself to wake up. lol

- ok so this time i dreamed i met the rock (Dwayne Johnson) and he was super cool n then zombie happened everywhere n he was my bodyguard n he got bit n i had to shoot him in the face before he turned bc id have no chance against a zombie with his build lol then my alarm went off right when my gun shot him in the face

- ok this time it was just weird af. i was at some kind of awards show i was sittin in the audience with all these celebrities n they were all gettin awards. im not a celebrity so i didnt get anything. when the awards were over n everyone was leaving 2 awards got forgotten abt on stage so i ran up n grabbed em when noone was looking bc i wanted awards too lol then i had to pee really bad so i ran into the bathroom only to find out it was the mens bathroom so i ran back out n into the girls bathroom where the 2 girls that forgot their awards saw me holding them n thought i was delivering them so i played along n gave them to their owners then as i was leaving the bathroom i saw an etched glass mortar n pestle sitting by the door as decoration so i swiped that instead lol then i left with the mortar n pestle n then i woke up

- ok, so this one was strange. i was like at a market of kiosks under like this big dock at an ocean n jayson bautista was there with Brittney Walta and some big scary rough lookin guy was trying to get me (idk why i think he wanted to kill me) and i was running and i didnt know abt J and B being there so im just runnin from this guy and i look behind me to see if hes still chasing me and i run right into J and B and their like omg dude what r u doin here and im like omg im so happy to see you guys theres this guy chasing me and then i hear GOT YOU YA LITTLE BITCH! behind me and its the guy! n J n B r like get behind us were gonna fuck this guy up and then i woke up

- ok....omfg....i literally jumped up terrified out of this dream n looked around my room to see if it was still there...im still scared af i feel like its watching me....i was with ray n 2 other ppl who i cnt remember bc i was so focused on the thing. we were sittin in the woods (campin i guess) n we kept hearing rustling sounds just beyond the trees. we turn a flashlight towards it n see this....thing...(tryin not to tear up just thinkin abt it) it was darting back n forth trying to avoid the light then it just stopped i guess it realized the light wasnt hurting it so then it RAN DIRECTLY AT ME n we all just froze n when it got to my face it stopped n its eyes like glazexx over with like a 2nd eyelid or someshit like it was pretending to be a statue or something n it stayed real still n everyone stared at it in horror thwn it opened its eyes n threw up thia black shit on the floor n GRABBED ME BY THE FUCKING THROAT NOONE HELPED ME THEY ALL JUST SAT THERE IN SHOCK AS THIS THING CHOKED ME  it had the calmest face as it it squeezed hardwr n harder on my throat it just stared n squoze....idfk dude......noone helped it was like it had this spell over everyone or they were just frozen in terror idfk.....im still scared....still feel like its watching me....cnt help it im crying a little im legit scared it felt so real im still not sure if it was just a dream or not....i dnt wanna go back to sleep i CANT go back to sleep......im still shaking (trembling?) ikfk dude.....fuck.....my heart wont slow down......i wamna get up but i dnt wanna leave rays side (sleeoing peacefully nxt to me) bc im legit terrified this thing is real n still watching me n knowing rays nxt to me makes me feel like ill be ok it looked like this....egyptian cat monster thing....like the egyptian cat god thing on DBZ but smaller like it culd sit in ur lap like the size of a small child im still crying god fucking shit its eyes blinked sideways like a fucking bird

- ok this one was crazy af. ray got kidnapped by some like terrorists or something and i went into this ship filled with them determined to get him back. i find this gun at the entrance thats in 3 parts so i click them all together real quick and go in. idk how this gun works but it has 2 handles with a trigger on each one. i try the first trigger n it shoots bullets in this one bad guys face. the nxt bad guy gets a face full of acid. (weird ik) so i kill like 10 guys n im almost there n my gun runs out of ammo so i grab 2 big  spikey looking machete things to duel wield i found on the ground n continue. then just as i get to the end n can see ray tied up with some other ppl this mat gets thrown down in front of me from around the corner and explodes like napalm or something. i catch fire. then i wake up. i feel bad for not being able to save him.

- this time I dreamed me n ray were at the zoo looking at the tigers (one white one orange) and i reached through the bars to pet one bc it was rubbing up on the bars n purring real loud and the tiger yanks me through the bars n everyone starts freaking out n i think im abt to die then they start purring again and rubbing all over me (their super strong so i feel smooshed af) n then they lay down on both sides of me n put their heads in my lap so i pet them n talk sweet to them like ""sweet little babies awwww u just want lovins dont u) n the zookeepers r like stay calm well get u out n rays so scared for me but when they come through the secret door for feedings the tigers wont let them take me n attack them so they retreat n im like mmmhhhmmmm thats what i thought im the queen of the tigers hahahha then they give me a zookeeper job bc the tigers love me so much n their so happy to see me when i come through with their food (2 big buckets of steaks) they even wait patiently as a set the buckets down for them n i say their names as i feed them (like when ur dogs r taking turns being fed so u say thier names so they know when its their turn) n we all lived happily ever after lol then i woke up

- ok so last night i dreamed i was at my moms house with Andrew Nieto, Jimmy Nieto, Shane, Marcus Gonzales, and Raymundo Borrego and this guy was hunting me (idk who, i never saw his face). Shane, jesse n jimmy were keeping watch outside the back door, marcus was watching the front door, and ray was with me hold up in my old room. the guy snuck up behind shane n stabbed him in the back right through his heart, jimmy got his throat slit, and jesse was stabbed multiple times in the front torso. the guy then hooked up a water hose to his exhaust and stuck it up under the front door were marcus was posted, but he saw n tied it in a knot to stop it. then ray woke me up.

- omfg guys this ones a doozy bc i had 2 crazy dreams.
1. i got really drunk the other night and i dreamed abt me runnin around drinkin water constantly n then passing out. my friends covered me in temporary tats so when i woke up i had 2 full tribal sleeves, a dragon on my  chest, and a single nipple that was perfectly dipped in bright blue glitter i dnt fuckin know wtf either guys lol

2. i dreamed i was hanging out with all my old friends like Nate NM, Eric Sitton, jeremy mata, and Austin Harris n they said they'd buy me makeup (idk y bc i dnt even wear makeup). we go to the store and were arguing over wether i shuld get the concealer thats darker or the one thats lighter then my skin tone, dnt buy anything, then walk out of the store. as were leaving (abt to walk around the corner) we see a guy standing between 2 cars at a red light ( one behind the other). the front car is a little too far in the box n decides to back up. the guy dsnt move as the car starts to move, the car behind it dsnt move either. the guy feels the front car finally as he begins to get crushed n bends over n grabs his socks (like when we got paddled in elementary). the car keeps going backwards until the 2 car's bumpers r touching n guy's spine is totally smooshed n his arms n legs r just hanging there. everybodys freaking out n im standing there laughing yelling OMG THAT WAS AWESOME!! over n over. then i woke up.

- me, ray, jimmy, jesse, shane, jeremy, n marcus were all in a super creepy house where we were gonna make a horror movie. there was a man with a chainsaw (like texas chainsaw) killing all of us one by one. first jeremy got chopped in half (head to toe), then shane go beheaded, then ray got dismembered, next jimmy got sliced through the abdomen, next jesse was impaled by the chainsaw. in the end, me n marcus were running through a field with the killer (me behind marcus bc he runs faster) closing in fast. marcus then reaches back n i grab his hand, he throws me in front of him right before the chainsaw gets shoved through his back n out his front. i woke up yelling ""MARCUS!!!"". he saved me......

- ok this one was weird, sad, then weird again. i was in my old room at moms but the bed was in a different place n i was playon games on my phone when i look over n therea a guy looking into my window from the back yard so I jump up n tell mom who comes with me n the guy is gone so we go into the backyard n nuthing then ray comes to pick me up n we go driving down the highway n as were driving there are big holes in the highway he keeps having to swerve to avoid (we can see the cars passing under us) then ray dsnt miss one n we hit it n go falling then i wake up n rays gone im

173,I think I died last night,Dreams,"Last night, or rather a few hours ago, I had quite an unusual dream. It was like no other dream I've ever had and I'm reluctant to even call it a dream.

I was laying in my bed with the lights off. I close my eyes and try to drift off. As I dance between consciousness I hear faint whispers around my room, they get closer, whispering into my ear but I can't understand them. I do not feel scared. Everything goes black but I'm not asleep. In the dark a circle of spectacular light forms. As it expands, it covers the the entirety of my vision. Rolling and flashing like a storm at sea,getting brighter and more fascinating. I ask myself ""what is this?"" still I am not scared. The light fills my eyes and everything is silent and white.

Suddenly I wake up. I stare at the ceiling above me. I soon realize this is not my bedroom ceiling but nor is it an unfamiliar one. It's the ceiling of my family home. I'm not sure how I know this, I just know. ""Why am I here?"" 
I try to move but something about my body is different. I feel weak and light. Frustrated, I begin to panic. Then I hear my mother's voice. I call out to her. ""Mum!"" I try to say but the only sound that  comes from my mouth are the cries of an infant. My mother walks over to me and cradles me. I try to tell her ""Mum it's me! I can't talk. Why am I here, mum?"" but again, I can only communicate by the wails of a baby. I'm desperately trying to let her know but she can't understand me. She continues to rock me in her arms and sing to me. 

I live out my entire childhood again but by now I have forgotten that I used to be an adult. That I had awoken one day as a child crying for my mother. I feel as if I've been living my life for years but I'd soon awaken to find it's just a dream. I go through my life experiencing the same events that have happened before, though, they feel brand new. I get older, watch my brother marry. See my grandparents die again. My mother and father grow old and frail. 

One night I lay in my bed, close my eyes and start to drift off. 
I feel that same panic. The same panic I felt waking as a baby in a cot. Helpless and weak. I cry out for my mother but this time I don't hear her voice. A feeling of dread washes over me and I sense something is wrong. I no longer feel my mother's presence. Or the presence of anything for that matter. Fear sets in and once again everything goes black. I'm surrounded by nothingness. Trapped in an endless darkness with nothing but my own panic. It's torturous and cold. It's so cold and I am alone. 

I scream. Now I'm awake. In my bed, at my current age. I'm crying and I feel the overwhelming urge to call my mother. I check to see I haven't been unconcious for decades but had only been sleeping for around 45 minutes. 

Now, I dream quite vividly and often. I have experienced MANY types of dreams, nightmares, sleep paralysis, hypnagogic hallucinations, you name it. Even as a child I would apparently have premonitions. I am also quite an experienced lucid dreamer and have been doing it for many many years. I can usually wake from a dream and feel certain of my self exactly what kind of dream it was and can shake any feelings of discomfort fairly easily. 

This dream felt unreal. Like it wasn't a dream. I actually feel as if I was in there for my entire life. I am genuinely shook up by this ""dream"". I tried to speak to my dad about it when I woke up and the best way I can describe it to him is that I felt as if my life had literally flashed before my eyes. I feel like I experienced some kind of death or rebirth.

175,Dream about my friend who died,Dreams,"This is my first post to this subreddit. Three weeks ago one of my good friends passed away from suicide and I dreamt of him three nights ago.

In the dream I was standing in line at the foyer of my old high school's auditorium waiting for my little brother's school orchestra concert to begin.

All of the people in line were wearing generally dark clothing with colors such as black, navy, dark grey, and tan to name a few. I glanced off to the side of the room and there I see my departed friend standing against the wall in a bright shirt that I can't rember whether it was tie-dye or a solid orange color.

Naturally I walk up to him and ask what he's doing here and that you're supposed to be dead. He doesn't see me. So, I wave my hand in front of his face and ask why he isn't speaking. No response. It was like I was the ghost not him. 

I start crying and walk back to my place in line. Looking back over he's still there, just standing, looking around, but still can't see me. 

I don't remember anything else after that. It was a strange dream and I've never had a dream that I remember experiencing sadness so, even stranger.",0,dream friend died first post subreddit three week ago one good friend passed away suicide dreamt three night ago dream standing line foyer old high school auditorium waiting little brother school orchestra concert begin people line wearing generally dark clothing color black navy dark grey tan name glanced side room see departed friend standing wall bright shirt rember whether tie dye solid orange color naturally walk ask supposed dead see wave hand front face ask speaking response like ghost start cry walk back place line looking back still standing looking around still see remember anything else strange dream never dream remember experiencing sadness even stranger

177,I spend half of my life in a world I can never share with anyone.,Dreams,"This is my first post. My dreams have started to have an effect of me long after I wake up that is becoming impossible to ignore, and I'm hoping someone here may've some advice or experiences to share. 

For as long as I can remember, all of my dreams have taken place in one extremely vast, vivid dreamscape. The dreams themselves don't repeat (although there are some common themes, usually involving some unknown person or group trying to kill me) but the locations where they take place are always the same. My dream world includes multiple cities, a huge theme park, an airport, shopping malls, a museum, stores, restaurants, beaches, highways, forests, neighborhoods full of houses and apartment buildings. I know them all as well as I know myself. I can tell you how to find any store in the mall. I notice when a ride at the theme park is remodeled. I know which roads to take to get where I'm going and what I'll pass along the way. Not ""know"" because they're places I invented in my brain. Know because I've been there, every night. 

I can't quite describe the longing I feel to see some kind of proof of this place. It's like the most intense nostalgia without even a photograph to look at. Even in my dreams I'll say ""look! it's the dream place I'm always trying to describe! I should take a picture of it so I can show everyone in the morning!"" I've tried dream journaling, and drawing, but it isn't giving me what I need. I've been through so much in this world. I've laughed there, cried there, experienced my wildest fantasies and most intense fears. I've spent half of my life in this place. In many ways it is like my true home. 

I don't necessarily know what kind of advice I'm hoping to get. It would be great to hear from anyone who dreams in a similar way, especially if you've also had problems removing yourself from your dream world during waking life and have found something that helps you.

179,I dreamt I was a calf,Dreams,"Last night, I dreamt I was a calf. I was at a place that looked like my school, but it had been modified for cows to be raised there. My classmate— who I shall call Bree— was there and was talking to the man who was taking care of us. She told him to protect me, and then suggested that he “branded the child.” So, he took me outside to be branded, but there were people outside. (They didn’t know it was me btw) On one side, a group of people were drawing graffiti on the wall, and the other side the people were just standing there. I was afraid of these people, and they rushed forward to attack me, but the man protected me and pushed them back— mind you there are probably 20 people there at least.  Then I woke up.
Anyone have any idea what this means?

180,Just had the weirdest half-lucid dream,Dreams,"Okay, so I say half-lucid because in the dream I knew I was dreaming, but I was still in the dream mind-state of just going with the flow of whatever happens. In this dream, I met someone else who was dreaming. They were trying to control the universe but were failing miserably, and so I was egging them about how good I was at lucid dreaming, creating lightning bolts and summoning aliens. I was being a real dick about it for some reason. If that person is real, and they're reading this, just know I'm sorry and I wouldn't act like that in real life. I know they're probably just a figment of my subconscious, but I've never had a dream like this before. I soon lost my lucidity, and it turned into a strange nightmare.

For some context, I have an eating disorder, and in this nightmare I was lost in a stairwell. I kept weighing myself over and over again, and the scale kept saying I was 10 pounds heavier than I am in real life. It was freaking me out, and soon I left the stairwell and came into an indoor pool area. There was someone else there with me, but I don't know who, it might've been the same person as earlier but I'm not sure. I wanted to go swimming, and I was even wearing underwear underneath my clothes that was passable as a bikini. The other person kept telling me not to swim, though, and it was kind of pissing me off. Right after this conversation, my boyfriend entered the pool area. He was looking around, and I could tell he was looking for me. Now we're at his house, and he tells me he had just been hanging out with my ex-boyfriend and his friend. Now, in real life, this group of people is kind of dumb and untrustworthy, so I can't see him going out of his way to chill with them. Although, in the dream, he said to me something like, ""those people are actually pretty cool, I'm glad I got to know them"" or whatever. Even in the dream I was shocked, but I didn't say anything rude about it. Eventually we try to watch the new El Camino movie that came out, but I asked him if we could watch it at my place instead. He agreed and I woke up.

The second paragraph here is just a log for me more than anything, but that first paragraph about me being somewhat lucid I really wanted to share here. That's never happened to me before, where I know I'm dreaming but I'm still in the dream consciousness. I hope that happens again.",0,weirdest half lucid dream okay say half lucid dream knew dreaming still dream mind state going flow whatever happens dream met someone else dreaming trying control universe failing miserably egging good lucid dreaming creating lightning bolt summoning alien real dick reason person real reading know sorry act like real life know probably figment subconscious never dream like soon lost lucidity turned strange nightmare context eating disorder nightmare lost stairwell kept weighing scale kept saying pound heavier real life freaking soon left stairwell came indoor pool area someone else know might person earlier sure wanted go swimming even wearing underwear underneath clothes passable bikini person kept telling swim though kind pissing right conversation boyfriend entered pool area looking around could tell looking house tell hanging ex boyfriend friend real life group people kind dumb untrustworthy see going way chill although dream said something like people actually pretty cool glad got know whatever even dream shocked say anything rude eventually try watch new el camino movie came asked could watch place instead agreed woke second paragraph log anything first paragraph somewhat lucid really wanted share never happened know dreaming still dream consciousness hope happens

184,Got to play an AFI song with Bill Nye,Dreams,"I managed to get 14ish hours of sleep yesterday (which never happens! I'm chronically exhausted...), and I feel that may have contributed to this awesomeness. 

Apparently I won some kind of contest in which I could perform a rock song with Bill Nye. I was so starstruck (I'm a science teacher myself who grew up watching the show) I couldn't decide what song to play so I just randomly started singing ""Silver and Cold"" by AFI. I don't even know all the lyrics and the vocals are a bit out of my range, but I performed perfectly in this dream. Bill just picked up on guitar along with my singing and gave a stellar performance. Oh man.

185,"The most surreal, scary, and most interesting dream I've had in a while.",Dreams,"The dream started with 7 year old me and 4 other friends at a fancy event, possibly a theater. We left the party and walked to a street that felt incredibly familiar and nostalgic, despite me never having been there in real life. it must have been winter in the dream because there was a huge mound of snow. I said something to make my friends laugh and climbed up the mound of snow. It was really powdery and I laughed as I tumbled down. Then we crossed the street and entered a hospital with seven floors, each one themed around one of the seven deadly sins. For some reason the hospital was built so half the floors were underground. Each floor had a gas in the air that was colored based on the floor's sin. The nurses all wore attire corresponding to the sin of the floor they were on. On the main floor the nurses dressed normally. One of the main hall nurses politely greeted us and walked us down further into the hospital. She had a very strange, overly formal demeanor and I was creeped out by her. I saw a fat nurse wheeling a corpse to the morgue on the gluttony floor. I think the last floor we got to was envy before that part of the dream abruptly ended. The next part of the dream took place in an old and mildly dillapitated farmhouse. I was older now, maybe 12 or 13. I was upstairs playing with a VR headset. However, instead of being virtual reality, it was augmented reality and it put enemies in the real world. I played H3VR and spent a lot of time customizing my 3 weapons of choice, a machine gun, a shotgun, and an SMG. There was someone sitting next to me and he handed me a red grip to put on the shotgun. I couldn't tell where the grip was supposed to go on the gun. He told me it was a ""pistol grip"" and that I was supposed to put it on the side of the stock, like a bandolier but instead of holding shotgun shells or bullets, it holds an entire pistol instead. He called me a dumbass for not knowing this. I was finally ready to play. I did a front flip out the window and held my machine gun in one hand and my SMG in the other. I walked down a steep hill, with two taller hills beside it. I sprayed down any enemies that spawned on the two hills. Then, a ton of enemies rose from the ground, presumably they were camouflaged. They were arranged in a checker formation. A timer appeared, and I had to shoot 30 of them before time ran out and they would be able to shoot me back. I succeeded, and the rest that didn't die exploded. I continued on down the road and came across a tunnel leading into a laboratory. Before I could walk through the corridor, a massive slime beast emerged. Terrified, I tried to fire a few shots into it with my shotgun to no avail. The beast overpowered me and tried to eat me. I was so scared I took off the VR headset and took a break. When I came back to the tunnel, I somehow got past the beast. I don't remember how I was able to. Next, I entered a room to the right. It was another hospital, although it was more like an infirmary. Instead of being filled with humans, however, it was filled with cats. Cute, small, humanoid cats. I sat in the waiting room and observed a nurse cat injecting a bedridden kitten with a syringe filled with a glowing orange liquid. The kitten started convulsing. Suddenly, an orange, thing-like mass emerged from the kitten. It grew rapidly and the nurse screamed. There was a door behind the mass and I ran up to the receptionist's desk and jumped off of it, flipping over the orange mass. I ran through the door and slammed it shut. A single cat was inside the room with me. The room looked like it was still under construction. I could hear screaming and banging coming from the waiting room. I sat cowering in the corner, hoping the thing doesn't get in. After a few seconds, the door burst open and the thing rushed in. It grabbed me and I spent the last part of my dream staring at the thing towering over me. Just before it lunged at me, the dream ended.",0,surreal scary interesting dream dream started year old friend fancy event possibly theater left party walked street felt incredibly familiar nostalgic despite never real life must winter dream huge mound snow said something make friend laugh climbed mound snow really powdery laughed tumbled crossed street entered hospital seven floor one themed around one seven deadly sin reason hospital built half floor underground floor gas air colored based floor sin nurse wore attire corresponding sin floor main floor nurse dressed normally one main hall nurse politely greeted u walked u hospital strange overly formal demeanor creeped saw fat nurse wheeling corpse morgue gluttony floor think last floor got envy part dream abruptly ended next part dream took place old mildly dillapitated farmhouse older maybe upstairs playing vr headset however instead virtual reality augmented reality put enemy real world played h vr spent lot time customizing weapon choice machine gun shotgun smg someone sitting next handed red grip put shotgun tell grip supposed go gun told pistol grip supposed put side stock like bandolier instead holding shotgun shell bullet hold entire pistol instead called dumbass knowing finally ready play front flip window held machine gun one hand smg walked steep hill two taller hill beside sprayed enemy spawned two hill ton enemy rose ground presumably camouflaged arranged checker formation timer appeared shoot time ran would able shoot back succeeded rest die exploded continued road came across tunnel leading laboratory could walk corridor massive slime beast emerged terrified tried fire shot shotgun avail beast overpowered tried eat scared took vr headset took break came back tunnel somehow got past beast remember able next entered room right another hospital although like infirmary instead filled human however filled cat cute small humanoid cat sat waiting room observed nurse cat injecting bedridden kitten syringe filled glowing orange liquid kitten started convulsing suddenly orange thing like mass emerged kitten grew rapidly nurse screamed door behind mass ran receptionist desk jumped flipping orange mass ran door slammed shut single cat inside room room looked like still construction could hear screaming banging coming waiting room sat cowering corner hoping thing get second door burst open thing rushed grabbed spent last part dream staring thing towering lunged dream ended
186,The most intense dream I ever had,Dreams,"LONG POST PROBABLY:

This is a dream I had several times over the course of two years while in uni, about 5 years ago. I only ever had this dream when it came to the exam season and the stress levels were higher. I was often getting up at 7am and studying straight through till 11pm or later. I also had pretty broken sleep too so I wasn't in a great way during this time. Happily, since graduating I've not had this dream at all. This is by far the most intense and vivid dream I've ever had.

&#x200B;

**The Dream:**

I'm running down an alleyway in the dark. It's pitch black, but I can make out a light at the end of the alley. It's raining - hard. I can feel the weight of the water pulling my clothes down. My shirt is sticking to my chest making it hard to breathe and my lungs are already on fire as I try to keep running. My trousers are burning and pulling on the hairs of my legs as they are weighed down by the rain, but I keep going.

&#x200B;

I can feel that there is something behind me, something bad, that I have to get away from. I feel like it's hunting me, so the urge to keep running despite the pain keeps me going. As I get nearer to the light, I can feel the hairs on my arms standing on end, catching the wind. It starts to sting now with every rain drop that hits my bare skin. I catch a glimpse of what's at the end of the alley, it's a road. I can see the rain and winder are heavier and stronger than there are where I am now, but I have to reach it. It's now that I can hear the thing that's chasing me, it's wolves. I hear the snarling and snapping of jaws grow louder as they get closer to me. I'm too scared to look back in case I fall, but I can almost feel them biting the heels of my shoes.

&#x200B;

I reach the end of the alley and fall onto the road, the rain is even heavier and I'm getting more and more drenched. I fall and feel the asphalt scrape my hands. I turn around thinking I'll see the wolves lunge for me. But they're gone, the alley and buildings are gone. It's just me, the rain, and the road.

&#x200B;

I see lights in the distance, coming towards me. As they get closer I can make out what they are - six lanes each full with big rigs driving full tilt towards me. They're staggered, so I try to dodge them as they drive past me. But the gust of wind as they pass, and the vacuum left behind when they're past pushes and pulls me around, making it harder and harder to move. I feel sluggish, like my legs are too tired from running, but I tell myself if I can reach the edge of the road I'll be OK. So I dodge and run as fast as I can to reach the edge of the outside lane, the trucks getting closer and closer together with each step I take.

&#x200B;

Just as I take the last step to get off the road, the last truck passes by and the wind it drags with it pushes me off the road, but the truck didn't hit me. I can't see where I'm falling, but I eventually land on my back on soaking, muddy ground. When my senses come to, I try to move, but my body is stuck. I can move my head but my body refuses my commands. The road and the trucks are gone, it's now almost completely dark. Just some low ambient light illuminating my body and the puddles in the mud around me.

&#x200B;

It gets quiet, the wind and rain have stopped. And I hear footsteps. I turn my head as far as I can to see who it is. There's a hooded figure walking towards me. They're barefoot, but it still looks like their feet aren't even getting wet, like their steps are gliding over the mud rather than going through it. The person stops about two feet from me, looking down on me. I can't see their face, but I can make out glowing perfect blue eyes, staring right into mine. I get scared.

&#x200B;

As soon as the thought of me being scared enters my mind, the person throws off their cloak and I see them, topless, and barefoot, wearing only a pair of trousers now. But it's me - a different version of me. Taller, stronger, fitter, better looking, and I can tell somehow - smarter. This alternate me is looking down at me and they're not angry, they just looks sad. His eyes are still glowing, but dimmer now. And I see a single tear fall from his eye, it lands a few inches from my fingers. I try to reach up to him, but I still can't move.

&#x200B;

He turns to leave and I try to call out, but my voice won't work. They walk away and leave me, disappearing into the pitch black. I lie there for a few more moments and then I wake up.

**End of Dream.**

&#x200B;

I've spoken to a few people about this dream, trying to figure out if it means anything in particular or if it was just a manifestation of stress. If you'd care to, I'd like to hear your thoughts.

187,I keep having this dream in which I die and am sucked out of my body,Dreams,"Up until yesterday, it always starts the same. I’m laying in bed when my body begins to tingle all over. I’m struggling to move, to escape this tingling feeling, but soon it overtakes me in the midst of my struggle, and it’s almost as if I’m sucked out of my body, and then I wake up in my real me, with it feeling as though my “soul” got transported from that dream me to the current me. I’ve had it several times, but usually not very often, however as of today I’ve had this dream two days in a row, but this time I was in my car when the tingling feeling of death came and I accepted it as opposed to struggling. The oddest part about this is I always go to the bathroom after waking up, so I go and look in the mirror, see my eyes incredibly red, look away and then look back and my eyes are perfectly clear. I don’t understand what’s happening or what this means or why I’m seemingly hallucinating my eyes being red.

191,Dreaming about being poisoned meaning?,Dreams,"There were a few people, I dont know who they were, I only knew my dad. (in the dream I knew the other people too, a bit)

There was a guy who put poison in a wine bottle. I thought it was just water in it, so I grabbed it and wanted to drink from it a bit.

and then suddenly, the guy who put poison in it yelled: ""It is poisoned!"" (he felt kinda guilty and looked upset)

then before I could drink any of it (but it was already in my mouth) I spit/spat it out immediately.

Then my dad came with me to the kitchen/dining room to quickly drink water.

I dont know where we was tho, but it was a big house for sure.

Tbh the whole bottle was posion, there was no water, nor wine in it.

I didnt die, in the end.",0,dreaming poisoned meaning people dont know knew dad dream knew people bit guy put poison wine bottle thought water grabbed wanted drink bit suddenly guy put poison yelled poisoned felt kinda guilty looked upset could drink already mouth spit spat immediately dad came kitchen dining room quickly drink water dont know tho big house sure tbh whole bottle posion water wine didnt die end

193,Why do I have these terrible dreams/nightmares?,Dreams,"I get really bad nightmares or dreams every night. It's always violent and crazy and scary. Sometimes it's my mom or boyfriend trying to murder me, sometimes it's violent dreams where I'm haunted by ghosts or being chased by them, sometimes it's just weird dreams that are scary. Most of them don't make sense when I wake up but they're very very horrible. Once I got a dream about Sharon Tate and she was violated and murdered and I saw her mangled corpse in my dream. That's by far the worst one ever.

I could feel the feeling in my dream and it felt a little too real. Then mostly I get a dream that my mom, my brother, my boyfriend and some random people are chasing me to murder me and I'm hurt and trying to get away but they're like RIGHT behind me. They never catch me but they're always on my tail. There's a lot of variations to the last dream but the basic premise is to kill me.

197,Dreaming of two strange Moons.,Dreams,"This dream happened quite some time ago but it's really stuck with me ever since. I'm new to Reddit & when I realized there was this sub I decided to give it a shot. I tried researching the meanings but I really couldn't find anything. 

The dream was relatively short & simple. It was night time, & I was standing outside with someone. The person prompted me to look up at the sky. There were two moons, almost eclipsing each other. In my dream, having two moons wasn't an oddity. It was normal. But the way they looked wasn't normal. 

The moon in the front (closer to earth) was completely black. Not a new moon - you could still see all of it. It was just black in colour. I knew in my dream that this wasn't normal & I started to feel dread. Like the moon was sick. 

The second moon, the one further from Earth, looked normal. Except that it was crumbling. Part of it was already missing & more of it was breaking off. It wasn't hitting the earth, so we were technically safe, but it was still horrifying & I knew it meant something bad. And then the dream was over. 

--- TL;DR: There were two moons in my dream about to eclipse eachother. One was completely black (not a new moon) & the other was beginning to crumble apart.

Does anyone have a clue what this might mean?

199,Devil wanted to eat me. Not teen Tumblr stuff.,Dreams,"So the story starts 6 years ago in my moms apartment. As a kid growing up i was made to believe that god exists even tho deep inside me i always knew god doesnt exist. My father was a terrible person and my mom always feared i'm going to become like him. My mother on the other hand was religious christian orthodox. As a kid i was a nice kid as i remember but inside me there was this evilness that i could always feel. I liked bad stuff, For example when i was 5 i decided that when i'll grow up i'm going to smoke because smoking seemed really cool to me. When i turned 14 i started smoking. So definitely bad genes and also i had no father around. My mom when through a lot and also had to go through shit like me. Theres no denying i'm a bad person but most likely i believe that the bad in me goes out because no one really understands me not even me. I said all that to justify the thing im going to say now. So because my mom brainwashed me into believing stuff that dont exist like horoscopes and religion it had unlocked in me the capability to be delirious and it being considered ok. I started to test if god exists by reading the bible of Satan and the bible of god. When i read those 2 funny books i still had some believe in me that it might be true, even tho my logic was against that idea. I came across the idea that i can provoke god into punishing me, I thought if he exists he will punish me. sound delirious enough? good read more. so i started to paint the symbol of the goat in schools with graphity paint and all around the neighborhood like the Antichrist because i'm fucking autistic. I also told my friends about Satan the fallen angel and his story..ye. So anyway i saw an add that said this: SATAN CHOOSES YOU! SELL YOUR SOUL NOW FOR A GREAT PRICE ;) L.. Which surprised me enough to click on it. Because not only the add knew that i was drawing those things and was interested in Satan. I thought wow that's Google's cookies right there best of their Kind. It wasn't because i saw the 'L' next to the title. My name starts with L. Theactualking is my username on Reddit because my name is Leon as A Lion. I thought ok...this is interesting. So i press it and it redirects me into a site where you can make an actual contract selling your soul. Get Whatever you wish for an internity in hell. That was the first line of the contract. I though that doesn't sound like something Satan would say lol who would actually sign it if it was real. so i do the contract hoping something will happen like Satan appearing in front of me or something. I sign the contract and press submit and the screen shows CONGRATULATIONS! You are now Doomed forever! I felt nothing just a bit of fear that it might be true but at the same time the reality was that someone made this site out of mere troll so me getting scared is exactly what the person wants to accomplish. So anyway it convinced me that god doesn't exist. I though well if Satan doesn't exist then god does neither. So i went on my day like nothing happened. When i went to sleep i saw really strange dream that i question to this day. So i start being a noble knight on a horse speeding through woods to get to a combat area. As i 
 was riding through the woods i saw beside me an enemy knight. So i though i'll fight him now beat him and proceed the way to the battle. So i get off my horse the enemy knight does aswell, and we start to fight. I don't remember the fight but then there is a flash back that i'm laying on the ground the enemy knight is standing above me and slices through a sword into my chest. There was a flash of light and then a tunnel that got me into a place. The place reminded me of  Minecraft nether (for some mysterious reason) So i'm in this cubic place of red rock and i'm standing on a platform that stops and has and edge with most likely a straight down cliff in front of me. but the platform blocks the view of what there might be down of the cliff and i don't seem really interested in seeing what it is i just am confused of where i am. No fear no feelings or panic just a bit confused. So then as i'm looking i see skulls in the corners of the wall behind me. So i assume i'm probably in hell. There you see a Person appears. Like a Granny she has hippie clothes on. You know the ones that are oversized for you hangs on your body and the material is really thin. She has many necklaces like felt ball ones on her wrist as well. The granny was Really tall like 2,5  meters or 8,2 feet (i googled that) gray dead hear so long it reached and was dragged on the floor. The Granny was so skinny you could see her skin hanging and you could see the structure of the skull just by looking at her and her eyes so round and appearing. She Looked at me and asked do you know where you are? I didn't say anything. She said do you want to know? I said nothing. Do you want to know what's down that edge over there? I looked and i just got a bit curious, and she immediately said come ill show you. I saw black type strange liquid and red dots all over appearing and disappearing. I thought 'whats that strange thing' She answered look closely and see. And i look closely i zoom in with my eyes and get stunned.. she says The red dots is magma and the blackness you saw before? That were dozens of burned down souls so many they cover the whole area and the light barely presses through. Do you want to hear them. I didn't but now i was really curious. The granny grabbed me by the shoulder and snapped her fingers. Suddenly i hear such screams so loud so painful that it was like they were screaming right to my ear so i panic and jump back to the wall and beg for it to stop. The Granny snapped her fingers grabbed by the hand picked me up and put her hand on my shoulder and waved with the other hand creating a see through cloud. She said the person who killed you afterwards fell down a waterfall. She said that as showing me it on the cloud. He is over there now. She points at the cliff, there was a mistake done you shouldn't be here so don't worry. So i ask her what am i going to do then. She says you see that elevator over there? and she points at a circular thing punched into a wall. She says from there the holy coin with the holy blood of Christ will fall soon. It is your key out of here. Soon it will fall. It does and she picks it up and gives me it. I look at it there was this in wards circular line with symbols on the lines and on the side there was the holy blood. The coins material was stone and it was a laptop wide and half of a basket balls thick. She then takes the coin and tosses it from the cliff. I have no reaction thinking this is part of procedure probably. From there a light appears like an alien spaceship and drags upwards the knight who killed me. So then it hit me that i got fraud. I looked at the Granny quickly thinking oh my god she's...she's and as im looking at her she was already smiling and as shes smiling shes becoming she turns slowly into a beast the place starts to have an earthquake hellquake. I start to run as fast as i can and i hear behind me. BOOM....BOOM....BOOM..BOOM...BOOM..BOOM.. BOOM. BOOM. BOOMBOOMBOOMBOOM. Heavy footsteps first walking then running. as i'm running in the hellquake i start hearing the people in the magma again screaming GOD IS MAD GOD IS MAD GOD IS MAD. Then i hear a light and i feel it as well it was god appearing. I hear the scream of the sinful again they are screaming HELP ME HELP ME. and as i'm running and i feel Satan is so close to me to grab me a crack open on the wall and i see grass through it and jump through the small crack and i become a snake. i crawl up to an apple tree and i wake up.

My legs were stuck to the ground. I made it up somehow, she walked us to a church nearby, we went inside and it was way too bright, all the lights were on and it made outside look even darker.

But I'm just gonna text about one.
I didn't know if this should be in which subreddit I should have posted this but here we go.

I was in some hospital walking through the floors/halls? Of the hospital and decided to go to the third stage. It seemed like a little flat so I thought that this is my flat now.
My cousin came over right after and it was dark outside , so we decided to go sleep.
But before that I told him that , if you go to sleep and float out of your body , then you can fly around everywhere!
So we talked a bit more and then we go to sleep.
I tried to go out of my body but it didn't worked. I was kinda a little out of my body , but because the Rest of my ""ghost body"" still touched my sleeping body so I couldn't escape.
I walked up in the dream and asked my cousin if he could get it right but he didn't answered. Seemed completely normal to me.
And then another dream came.

What does this mean? 
What would have maybe happened if I actually escaped my sleeping dream body?
I would be very thankful if you answer that!

* Driving around my hometown of Ipswich with 2 friends in a gadget-filled red Ferrari.

205,Semi lucid dream?,Dreams,"I've never been a dreamer. My dreams are often short or are immediately forgotten. But i've always wanted to lucid dream. Last night when I was incredibly tired and likely to fall asleep in seconds, I kept repeating in my head: ""Everything I am about to experience is going to be a dream."" I don't know how but suddenly found myself in my math classroom, I was having a bad time solving problems when all of the sudden I realized: ""Hey wait a second- It's the weekend why am I in math class?"" So I did some lucid dream checkups, I checked the clock and yep, it was spazzing out, I drew a symbol on my hand and it stayed there, I realized I was in a dream and did some stuff out of my free will, like... grabbing a machete and... hacking everyone in the room...? Don't get me wrong, looking back on it I'm really surprised. I thought I had free will and made some decisions myself, but also... not? When I woke up the first weird thing I realized was that I had no sensation in the dream, I had no sense of touch, I could see, but not hear touch smell or taste. I am really confused...

Was this a dream about lucid dreaming where I happened to realize I was in a dream, or was that part of the dream? This is some inception shit i'm really confused...

Can anyone explain this to me? Is this some sort of first step to lucid dreaming or something?

206,A Nightmare(?) I Had,Dreams,"This dream really caught me off guard. I haven’t had an elaborate dream that I woke up from in half a year so I was freaked out by this long dream and the side-effects (at the end)

(Warning: Incredibly long. TL;DR below)

The dream abruptly starts with me in school (my dreams never have any build-up to the plot, I’m just abruptly thrown into it. Is that normal?), although it’s not like any classroom from my school, because the ground was temporarily made from red carpet at the beginning, but it actually switched back to the hard ground mid-dream and dream me didn’t notice. I’m actually on Fall Break right now so the fact I got a school related dream on my first day off is weird imo.

(Spin Section)
The class is taking some kind of test and in the middle of it my body starts getting sudden urges to start wiggling. Like I genuinely couldn’t sit still, I got really bad, embarrassing urges to move my body, so I started un-controllably wiggling my butt in my seat. My other classmates notice and comment on it, probably didn’t say anything too important. This makes me notice that my classmates aren’t from the same class, they’re a combination of all my classmates I had from Kindergarten to present day (all the ones I remember from Elementary all looked older to match the age group of the classroom). There either wasn’t a teacher in the classroom, or the teacher didn’t give two s***’s about what was happening.

So eventually, my wiggling urge gets so out of hand that I just straight get up out of my seat and start spinning in place (classmates make derogatory comments on this as well), much like a dance move. I was spinning for a long time at a time too, maybe roughly 11 rotations in one spin. I always fell down after every spin (of course it was around this time that the ground reverted to the hard ground). Sometimes while spinning I get so much speed that I would lift off of the ground like a helicopter and spin in mid-air, hover for a good moment, and then kind of launch myself against a wall. Sometimes I launch into a classmate’s desk and it got really embarrassing. This would basically repeat itself for quite some time. I start spinning to relieve myself of my weird, unbeatable urge to spin, I helicopter myself into the air, and I either fall onto the ground or launch into a wall. 

(Dog Section)
Now the dream kind of **[abruptly throws me into]** another plot point. I leave school and am being driven home by my Grandma for some reason. By the way, I didn’t have any recollection of actually leaving the school and getting into my Grandma’s car. One moment I was spinning in school and the next I kind of pull a King Crimson and am suddenly being driven home by my Grandma. 

While near my house, I’m panicking because of what happened at school, and I try telling my Grandma I have something important to tell her. While she is confused at my rambling, we crash into another car, but the crash suspiciously resembles a car crash I had in her car previously this year (no injuries at all, Grandma’s car just looked weird for the rest of the year). While we get out of the car to inspect the damage, I notice I had a fairly large bite mark and what looked to be a claw mark on the top of my right leg, probably from a small dog or some other creature, definitely not an insect (this is important later). I hypothesized for the time being that the bite infected me with a disease that made me obsessed with moving/spinning. Then it starts raining. It was a clear sky with barely any clouds, but it was raining. Hard. So me and my ‘ma just completely abandon the car and try to get home, which was really close. 

We try to take a shortcut through this area had never seen before. It was a couple of black abandoned houses just together in rows. They almost looked copy-pasted. The grass looked pretty enough. It looked creepy but not a comical “this place is definitely evil” creepy. Oh yeah, the woman we crashed into and this other guy who I *think* ran out of gas for his car joined us. 

Everyone else is farther ahead than I am (this is also important later), and suddenly this Weiner dog starts mean-mugging me and aggressively pulls on my pants. Suddenly, a s*** ton of Weiner dogs and Pomeranians specifically that were apparently working together just start surrounding everyone and growling. There must have been at least 50 of them total. Every time someone moves, the dogs surround that one person. They’re fast as hell, so trying to simply outrun them wasn’t an option. There was so many I accidentally stepped on some trying to re-adjust my position, but they didn’t seem too angry about that. My body started vibrating intensely, but that was probably more from outright fear more than the disease, although I wouldn’t be surprised if the disease played a part in it.

I didn’t see, but I assume what happened is that one of the randoms cracked under pressure and made a run for it, because all of the dogs started chasing after a specific target. Because I was so far behind and the dogs went in front of me, I escaped through the opposite direction (entrance) of the pathway and ran home as fast as I could... Is what I attempted. I made it home but I didn’t run the full way, my dream made another jump-cut and suddenly I was in my room at my house.

Once in my room I was relieved I made it out alive. The spins came back, but I was alone in my own house and fairly used to the spins by this point, so it wasn’t as anxiety-inducing, but I started getting drastically more dizzy from them than before. Once I finally got over my spinning urge for the time being, I remembered that my Grandma was still at the shortcut with the dogs, so I texted 911 (yes, texted. Idk either). After I contacted them they said they were on the way. By this point I was way too dizzy to even try to leave the house and go back for Grandma. At the end of my dream I hear a distant yet close, loud yet quiet, rumbling. I assumed that I was too late, and that rumbling was the sound of the army of dogs finishing off the rest of the people at the shortcut, including my Grandma. And then the dream ends and I wake up.

**(TL;DR)**
I am affected with a disease that gives me an uncontrollable urge to move and spin my body around at school while I was taking a test. I’m driven home by my Grandma and we crash, so we take a shortcut to the house with two other people. A bunch of Weiner dogs and Pomeranians jump us. I was the only one to escape. I start spinning again at my house, but now I start getting actually dizzy from it, unlike before. I contact 911 so they can rescue the rest of the people at the shortcut. Shortly after, I hear a loud rumbling, which is implied to be the dogs killing off everyone else at the shortcut, then I wake up.

One other creepy thing about this dream was that I genuinely felt dizzy like in my dream after waking up, as if I had actually been spinning. I could barely walk straight after getting up. I recovered fairly quickly though. That really freaked me out at the time. I never had my physical style kind of transfer from my dream into real life. Also I’m not sure if it was the dogs who gave me the disease or not. I’m kind of 50/50 about it. I doubt my dream would have that much foreshadowing, but it’s possible.


I remember hearing that all dreams have some hidden meaning relating to your life. I have no idea what this dream is trying to say. What, “You’re a coward who will abandon a family member and leave them to be killed”? Was that the message? Honestly, I wanted to share probably one of the most elaborate dreams I’ve ever had (me dreaming is incredibly rare in itself) and give this subreddit my story.

209,A dream I had last night,Dreams,"Dream from October 10th 2019. This is my most recent dream but I can't say it was from October 10th, it was the last dream I had leading to me waking up at 6:15 am. The dream was mainly about how I was in my house watching tv on a dark night. I hear a knock at my door and I answered it. The person standing there looked like a type of person who has ""magic"" powers, like a fairy but the same size as me, one you would see in the movies. He looked like a normal guy but he told me he could take me to a specific time in the past for as long as I want. The details get blurry after this but I found out I had been taken to October of 2003. Why 2003? I don't know. But as I walked out the door of my old house, I found out that all my personal posessions were still on me. I was in the year 2003 with a phone made in 2017, an id from 2016, etc. I got super excited and I saw people walking by, every single one of them had much older technology and outfits. One was using a flip phone that had many buttons, I walked up to a person and showed him my touchscreen phone, which would not be released to the public for another 4 years. The person looked completely stunned, he was questioning how did this exist, how much I paid for this, where he can get one, and just expressed obvious disbelief. After that, I realized the potential of being the only person who knew exactly what was going to happen for the next 16 years leading up to 2019, I told groups of people that a touchscreen phone would be released in June 2007 and it would completely revolutionize the phone industry. Meanwhile, I was thinking of ways to take adavntage of my knowledge of what was going to happen in the future but my mind was struggling to come up with things, either things I had recalled in my dream or I had forgotten after I woke up. Either way it was the strangest experience and probably one of the best dreams I've had recently. Eventually my phone died about 16 hours later and I could not charge it because the cord for the touchscreen phone I was using was not mass produced in factories yet. I explored for another 8 hours around the much older hometown and every car I saw was made no later than 2003. I could not find the 2 year old version of me because my 18 year old self had taken his place. Strange. Eventually the same man I had met at the beginning of the dream returned and said ""time's up"" and teleported me back to 2019, exactly where I was standing in the doorway looking out and the man was no longer there and then I woke up.

214,Dreamt about my deceased Mother,Dreams,"For context, my mom died when I was 14 due to alcoholism, I am 19 now. I also never dream about her.

Last night I had one of those dreams that is so intense it wakes you up. I don’t recall all the details but I will piece together the parts I do remember.

There was me, my older brother and my mother living in the house I grew up in. I catch my mom up on big things in my life (graduating, my job, etc).

At one point, I introduce my ex-boyfriend to her but not as my ex just as my boyfriend (For context; My Ex and I have been on-and-off since 2017 and I went through being cheated on and lots of abuse, not too long ago I blocked him on absolutely everything and told myself I am never going back). After introducing  them my mother pulls me aside and warns me he is no good for me.

From this point on I don’t remember as much, but it was kind of like the movie groundhog day where in my dream i kept reliving the same exact day. No matter what i did, my mother would end up dying somehow. then i would wake up and try to save her and she would die a different way. and then a different way. 

Until I woke up at 3am trying to make sense of all this.

I never remember my dreams and if I do my dreams are typically just silly or random, but this one hit me.

Before the movie started, there was a King of the Hill related ad, specifically for a movie titled ""King of the Hill: The Movie: To Hill and Back"". While I don't remember much about the trailer, its ending made quite the impression on me, as it had Hank and Bobby in a ROCKETSHIP and Hank said ""Where we're going, we won't need propane"" before goong hyperspeed.

216,What could this possibly mean...,Dreams,"I had the longest and most vivid I’ve ever experienced. 
I’m currently residing in an African country for my studies (reality) and found out I was pregnant. Because abortion is illegal I had no choice here so I ended up telling my family and they were oddly VERY supportive and offered to take care of my child whilst I continue my studies however the reality set in and I was 100% confident about wanting an abortion. 

I go back home to England and meet my best friend let’s call her T (I’m 3 months pregnant by this time). She works in a shelter for pregnant women (this is just in the dream irl she’s a student like me) and she doesn’t offer me any sort of help or support which is very unlike her. I even beg and plead w her even says if she finds an abortion clinic she would prioritise “Kristina” who is another patient in the shelter to get an abortion before me and she’s yet to find it so she cannot help me.
The last part of my dream I just accepted this and felt alone and decided that I would get a hanger or kill myself to rid myself of this baby and woke up.
I still feel the hopelessness and desperation from the dream and had to google abortion laws in different countries just in case this ever came true to set my mind at ease😂
Another note is that I’m a virgin and still a virgin in this dream! As a fact I’m baffled as to how I even became pregnant in the first place.

I don't remember how the dream started but I was in my room and I was kinda rescuing colourful slugs, like 5-6 maybe, they were in my room and I was trying to put them in their natural habitat ( There's a lot of wild vegetation behind my room, I live in A hostel room in my college). 

And as I was doing that I saw a baby snake about 14-15 inches long under my table, I looked at it and it seemed really fascinating to me, it looked very different from other snakes ( I find all snakes fascinating but this one was very different) after like a minute of inspection I went back to the slugs. After I was done with the slugs I went back to the snake and I got bit worried as to how it got there and how am I going to send it back to his home/habitat whatever and then again I started inspecting the little detail on it's body and like really looking at it in confusion and awe.

That's all I remember.

Creepy.

There are 3 things about this dream:

1. I randomly wake up sometimes
2. The topic of the dream/ the People that show up in it are completly random
3. I always wake up to go to the bathroom and get a glass of water


The dream starts off in complete darkness, im on a spaceship, stage or anywhere really, then it cuts to Black again, shows something aproaching, and then shows me, motionless, on the floor.

I then start to hear yelling, screaming, and see text saying weird shit like ""YOU KNOW THAT THATS NOT THE WAY TO DIE"", I then wake up, screaming, crying, my heart is pumping like i've ran 2000 miles and made it alive, but somehow...
Somehow, im still in the dream.
Somehow, i still hear the screaming.

I plop back to bed, it starts all over.

I eventually wake up and go get a glass of water, without the screaming ofc.

I then plop myself back to bed and NEVER HAVE THAT DREAM EVER AGAIN FOR THE REST OF THE NIGHT.

225,I can see things that I’ve never thought before which are most likely real,Dreams,"This happens rarely and it’s such a strange thing. It’s difficult to explain but, in my dreams I can hear or see things about people that I’m not  even close with, and when I think about the stuff I see or hear, there’s a huge chance that they are actually true. 

For example:
I know a person whose name is X but I’m not that close with them. I also know Y and Z who are close to X. I hear a conversation between Y and Z. They are talking about X and saying things that (when I think about them) have a huge possibility of being true in real life. Btw they are not talking about X’s personality and stuff. They are talking about something X had done which I haven’t heard or thought about it in real life
but after waking up thinking about it, sounds so
possible that that thing happened.

Another example:
I see a person A in my dream doing something and it’s such a thing that I’m so sure they did that thing and it actually happened in real life because it’s such a thing person A would do.

Today when I woke up, I said omg I have a fucking power.

226,"I had two bodies, one of them was myself and one was a cat. The narrative kept switching between them.",Dreams,"Okay, so the narration was focused on a random cat with sunglasses on her head, sitting on a pile of Steven Universe's shirts, and other cats nearby. This cat (AKA me) was thinking about how tired she was of trying and failing to organize the group. Not that she couldn't control them, but that she herself couldn't get anything done, thus failing the rest of the team. She decided to surrender her leadership to another cat, before entering a building to cool off.

When she walked past myself and Dad, the narrative switched to me. I was thinking and talking to him about that same issue. Then I said that for all my life, I'd been leader of these cats. But now everything was changing... He said something, and I started thinking about my existence as a cat. (This is when the narrative revealed that me and the cat were the same person.) Being a cat just felt... Right.

When I looked at my cat body, who now had solid brown fur, a brown gem on her chest and a brown gem on her underbelly, the POV of the story flipped to the cat. I decided to do at least something good for the autumnal season, so I started looking for snacks. Also, did I mention that the building I was in looked like a grocery store? So, my human body disappeared into an aisle while my cat body walked around. There was an aisle apparently dedicated to chocolate syrup, and I wasn't satisfied with that because cats can't eat chocolate.

When I left the aisle to walk to the next one, I was startled by the sight of glowing eyes at the back door, before realizing it was a cat. Then I was startled by two more. I somehow opened the door to let the three cats (two of which were my actual cats) in.

Then I woke up.

227,Dreamt about a friend who took his life. Seemed very real and has messed with me all day. Thoughts?,Dreams,"I had a friend who I grew up with since early elementary school.

It’s been close to a year and half since this happened and I had the strangest dream last night and it felt so real. It started out downtown in my home town. I was hanging out with my friend and another good friend from our elementary days. Everyone seems to know he passed, but are strangely okay with the fact that he is back. 

We all are catching up and we end up back at my friends house and we are reliving a sleep over we had in 3rd grade. This part felt so real. It was me, my friend who passed, and our other friend. Everything was going fine and we were asking questions about the incident. I then decided to ask what the other side was like. The moment I finished the question my friend who is no longer with us rolled over and attacked me. He was like a demon. He bit into my arm like a zombie. Blood went everywhere and I woke up.

232,Vivid murder dream,Dreams,"I often have very vivid dreams- many of which I can still remember parts of even 20 years later. So having these types of dreams which seem startlingly real aren’t new for me. But last night I in my dream, I had a first- I had choked someone to death, and then threw their body out of a sort of ferry into the water. But the ferry was only like a 30 meter ride connecting my hotel to another place. So the body was obviously going to be found soon. 
In the dream I had apparently been very drunk when I did this- but I felt immediately that everything in my life as I knew it had changed. I had killed someone. And I was going to go to prison for the rest of my life. 
But somehow they never figure out it was me... But I’m stuck in a cycle of still being in this hotel where it happened, like limbo. 
In my dream I was so devastated- it was like I had actually killed someone and the self hate and the fear of getting caught were so real. One of the worst and most terrifying dreams I’ve ever had.

233,I had the same dream,Dreams,"When I was 12 my mom’s then-boyfriend reluctantly told us a horrible nightmare he had a few weeks before. I thought it was disturbing but I wasn’t overly frightened. That night I went to bed and had the EXACT SAME dream. I’ll do my best to explain it...

My mother and I are inside a chain linked fence with a playground outside of a one room school house you’d see an abandoned mining town. Children are playing on the playground, running around quite happily. Outside of the fence is golden grassland as far as the eye can see with a cloudless blue sky. Suddenly, the sky goes red and the teacher of said schoolhouse starts screaming for everyone to “get inside! Get inside now!” And we run inside and bolt and barricade the wooden double-doors. My mom and I look out the window to the right of the doors overlooking the yard and chain link fence. Outside the fence we see a boy and a girl with matted, short black hair. They were pale as paper with overly large eyes that were just sockets, wearing all black torn clothing. Their walking was not right. They took slow, jerky steps toward the fence and speaking in lifeless voices that reverberated throughout the schoolhouse all around us saying, “Miss Krystin. Miss Krystin.” (My mother’s name) They just kept repeating that as they climbed the fence like a couple of spiders. My mom was pacing back and forth covering her ears crying, “I don’t know you, I don’t know you”.. When they make it over the fence they stop and stare. Everything goes quiet and they say in unison, “We know you.” And I wake up with my heart pounding, breathing hard and shaking. It was the first time since I was 6 that I got up to sleep in my mom’s bed. It was horrifying. I have no idea what it might’ve meant.

238,I dreamt everyone died to a song I had never heard,Dreams,"I used to have lots of nightmares as a kid. Standard stuff like monsters and darkness. It began to slow down as I reached middle school and then happened once in a blue moon throughout high school. I can’t remember the last nightmare I had, but this, this was horrifying.

The dream starts with my immediate family (mom, dad, younger brother) visiting a cabin with a family I did not recognize. They didn’t have any children but it was a married couple who seemed to be the same age as my parents, so late forties early fifties. I’ll call them Jane and Robert for clarity sake. The cabin was implied to be theirs based on their familiarity with it in the dream, but I did recognize the cabin when I woke up as my friend’s cabin, a place I had visited every summer for the past few years. Anyway, back to the events.

Though I had never had a dream like this prior, my brother and I both knew to watch for “the man outside.” Our rooms had two large windows and we spent a good part of the beginning of the dream looking outside, fearful he may be out there and wanting to see him before he saw us. We were called downstairs soon after where things started to act up.

The Cabin next door to us had one of those huge windows that takes up the entire wall and let’s you see everything outside. Not sure what the neighbor had been doing, but I recall Jane yelling about how Robert hadn’t come home and it was probably the neighbor’s fault. It gets a bit fuzzy here but Jane calls the neighbor, who I can clearly see from his large window, and watch him pick up his phone and talk to Jane. Things then go dark.

It suddenly flashes to night time. My brother and I are eagerly awaiting for Stranger Things Season 4 to drop and we have the tv all set up. Just as soon as we hit play, things act up in the house, immediately distracting us from the first episode. We notice shadows running by our window, and we know it’s the man outside. We rush downstairs to tell our parents who seem to be already aware. Robert hadn’t come home, and now we knew why. Delicately hung against the screen door was his body, the back of his head blow out behind him. Jane pulls out her phone again and says Robert’s name, only for her own brains to suddenly spew out behind her, as it some invisible force had yanked them out. My brother and I scream and run to a corner room, while our parents panic in the kitchen.

Even though it had only happened once, I realized the pattern was if you say the name of the person who just died, then you would be next, like a domino effect. Before I could tell my parents this, I heard my Dad call 911 and tell them “Jane’s head blew out.” I immediately ran to grab my brother when I heard my mom scream. Instead of having blown our brains, my dad’s head seemed to have purple veins spreading over it. He angrily grabbed my mom, throwing her against the wall. 

We ran back to the corner room and locked the door, crying and shaking. Even though it had only felt like a few moments, the first episode of Stranger Things was over. That’s when I heard the song. I remember the rhythm and tone, but that’s hard to convey. The lyrics are a blur, but I do remember one lyric: “Your heart is magic.” The voice was a male’s, relatively deep, and somber. The lyric repeated in a slow and soft rhythm as my brother and I cried in the darkness, only lit up my the tv. 

Then I woke up. I wasn’t shaking, crying, or gasping. It was a very calm awakening. And yet I felt very tense, and I couldn’t get the lyrics out of my head. I didn’t know that song, at least I was certain I had never heard it. Googling the lyrics led to nothing, making me think I had misheard. How could such a distinct rhythm, voice, and lyric come together and stay crystal clear. It’s been an hour now since I woke up and I keep thinking about the song more than any other horrific thing that happened in that dream.",0,dreamt everyone died song never heard used lot nightmare kid standard stuff like monster darkness began slow reached middle school happened blue moon throughout high school remember last nightmare horrifying dream start immediate family mom dad younger brother visiting cabin family recognize child married couple seemed age parent late forty early fifty call jane robert clarity sake cabin implied based familiarity dream recognize cabin woke friend cabin place visited every summer past year anyway back event though never dream like prior brother knew watch man outside room two large window spent good part beginning dream looking outside fearful may wanting see saw u called downstairs soon thing started act cabin next door u one huge window take entire wall let see everything outside sure neighbor recall jane yelling robert come home probably neighbor fault get bit fuzzy jane call neighbor clearly see large window watch pick phone talk jane thing go dark suddenly flash night time brother eagerly awaiting stranger thing season drop tv set soon hit play thing act house immediately distracting u first episode notice shadow running window know man outside rush downstairs tell parent seem already aware robert come home knew delicately hung screen door body back head blow behind jane pull phone say robert name brain suddenly spew behind invisible force yanked brother scream run corner room parent panic kitchen even though happened realized pattern say name person died would next like domino effect could tell parent heard dad call tell jane head blew immediately ran grab brother heard mom scream instead blown brain dad head seemed purple vein spreading angrily grabbed mom throwing wall ran back corner room locked door cry shaking even though felt like moment first episode stranger thing heard song remember rhythm tone hard convey lyric blur remember one lyric heart magic voice male relatively deep somber lyric repeated slow soft rhythm brother cried darkness lit tv woke shaking cry gasping calm awakening yet felt tense get lyric head know song least certain never heard googling lyric led nothing making think misheard could distinct rhythm voice lyric come together stay crystal clear hour since woke keep thinking song horrific thing happened dream
239,Dream from when I was a little toddler,Dreams,"Hey guys this occurred for a few years, I remember from around the age of 2-3 til around 5 I constantly had a recurring dream of being chased by skeletons. It honestly happened so commonly probably once every two weeks or so. I could fully see the skeletons coming for me but no matter how hard I tried to escape I couldn't move, I was frozen and they'd grab me and pull me away. I have been researching types of dreams and their meaning and apparently chasing skeleton dreams mean that there was a dark past or haunting events that happened in ur life which u tried to suppress, but are now impacting you. How can a 2 or 3 year old have had a haunted or dark past? Is it possible this dream is related to a past life?",0,dream little toddler hey guy occurred year remember around age til around constantly recurring dream chased skeleton honestly happened commonly probably every two week could fully see skeleton coming matter hard tried escape move frozen grab pull away researching type dream meaning apparently chasing skeleton dream mean dark past haunting event happened ur life u tried suppress impacting year old haunted dark past possible dream related past life
240,Dream of a malfuntioning heart,Dreams,"A few days ago I had a dream that I was killed with some type of horn stabbing into my heart. I remember feeling the pain of it very vividly and I remember thinking ""this is what it feels like to die?"" I was somewhat okay with dying but I tried screaming out to my family who were a bit further out to warn them just in case there was a chance I could *not* die but no sound came out of my mouth, then I woke up. 

Last night, I dreamt about having a hernia in my heart? I didn't know what a hernia was before looking it up this morning, so it doesn't make sense but anyway as a result of this hernia I had a giant accordion tube coming out of my chest (connected to my heart). It needed to be changed all the time and it had to be quick because I would stop breathing and my heart stopped beating. (I always link death with the feeling of suffocating or drowning idk why) the first few times some fictional person I trusted took care of it but later every time it needed to be changed there were tons of people around but no one would want to help even if they saw that I was dying. I didn't know how but people would just say I had to learn to do it myself and others didn't want to get involved so they looked away. 

In these dreams it's always the same pain. For the last three weeks though I've been having panick attacks that include the same sort of pain. Sharp heart cramps and a heavy weight and tightness in my chest with difficulty breathing. Are my dreams just me having a panick attacks/heart cramps in real life and my brain is just supplying images? Or is there something my subconscious is trying to tell me by physically hurting me and giving me these dreams? I just want to know what these mean.",0,dream malfuntioning heart day ago dream killed type horn stabbing heart remember feeling pain vividly remember thinking feel like die somewhat okay dying tried screaming family bit warn case chance could die sound came mouth woke last night dreamt hernia heart know hernia looking morning make sense anyway result hernia giant accordion tube coming chest connected heart needed changed time quick would stop breathing heart stopped beating always link death feeling suffocating drowning idk first time fictional person trusted took care later every time needed changed ton people around one would want help even saw dying know people would say learn others want get involved looked away dream always pain last three week though panick attack include sort pain sharp heart cramp heavy weight tightness chest difficulty breathing dream panick attack heart cramp real life brain supplying image something subconscious trying tell physically hurting giving dream want know mean
241,Disturbing dream about the castle siege,Dreams,"Well, i was dreaming about being a general, besieging a medieval castle. Normally i would defeat defenders on the walls and then head for the inner keep to fight royal guard. But this time i bypassed fighting on the walls and streets and went straight for the throne room. I ran into the king there. He was armed and ready for the fight. We were fighting violently for a while. I was very tired so I needed to end this fight quickly. Eventually i took a swing into the gap under his helmet i took his life.  

When people outside learned that king fell, enemy knights gave up the castle and swore truce. They knew they were overpowered. And even if they would able to defend, death of the king meant internal problems of power transition. So they gave up.  

I went on a stroll down the street, but people of the city were very hostile, two of them tried to kill me. A blacksmith attacked me with hot metal bar that he was forging, but i dodged and called the guards. I went to the Main Gate. The bridge of this gate was ruined (blown up?), therefore gate itself was useless. So they used it for dumping the corpses into the huge crater outside the gate.

Now, spiritual part starts. I was presented with what appeared to be stripped naked, body of the king, with no blood, just pale, dead body. Somehow I knew, it was his spirit or something. I needed to kill it as well to be fully done with my victory. Then i needed to dump the spirit of the gate, first binding it some kind of other body. So i reached for his chest i i started touching it hard, i was touching this dead body, for the pleasure of realizing that he finally, really is dead. Grabbing his dead, pale chest like that was a final spit in his face, cuz he was dead, he could not react. I took my knife and stabbed the stomach. Blood and guts spilled over his belly. I went with the blade higher, to the chest and i ripped it open. I heard some loud screaming in the nearby room. Never mind. Blood was everywhere, on his pale, gray skin. Then i took the knife, and went back to the lower body, cutting all the way to the level of the hips. I thought about cutting open his scrotum and penis, just to castrate the corpse, but i was like, whatever. Then i dumped his spirit, which immediately entered some very, very small body, then slipped outside from the gate to the crater.  

I entered nearby room where the screaming was coming from. The dungeon. My exorcist advisor, whose name i cannot recall, was busy sealing some spirits in the prison. When I woke up, I remembered his name, even wanted to use it in my book because it had a very gentle ring to it. But I forgot. Me killing king's spirit was also his instruction. I met a young girl there. She was a bit sad, but her eyes were fixed on one point, like as she was in some kind of trans of something. She said:

*- Hello my new king.*

*- Hello* \- i answered *- i heard screaming here. Was it you?*

*- Yes. I gave birth to a sad baby. But i already killed it and dumped down the gate. And now, I can be REAL MAID!*

Being shocked that this kid just killed it's own baby, I wanted to do something about it but soon realized that my exorcist probably ordered her to do this, so king's dead spirit can enter baby's body and be gone. He probably filled her with a little story so she won’t be too traumatized. So i kept silent, even tho the thing she did was awful. After this we went on a walk around the dungeon, seeing spirits and demons of various forms. One was like a cloud of grayish rectangles, swarming in the cage, the other one was anthropomorphic, at least 5 meters tall. The exorcist was sealing them in the dungeon, but a lot of little ones were floating around, and I had a power to shove them into the cages. My young companion said she doesn't like it.

*- My master, the exorcist is evil, he is doing evil deeds.*

She was actually using his first name, and it sounded disturbing in her mouth.

*- Calm down young one - I was comforting her - exorcist has very important job here. We need to be safe from these demons.*

The atmosphere was very dense and scary. There was this unsettling sense of danger and unrest. A lot of spirits screaming in the cages. On the way back I caught one small demon, which looked like a little gray jelly, and shoved it into the cage. Maybe it was really my power, or it was the presence of the exorcist.

*- My master* \- said the girl *- i see now, this work here is very important for our safety, this is exactly why you shouldn't trust the exorcist!*

The last thing i remember, is getting dizzy, feeling dark and evil presence, and the view of girl screaming:

Last night I drempt that I was working in a super market (literally never worked in one before) and I was stocking a shelf late at night when this girl I stopped talking to like 6 months ago irl came up abd started hitting on me. She wanted to make love but I remember saying ""I cant just leave I need this job"" (again literally never worked in a grocery store before). So she decided to make love in one of the aisles. She grabbed a beer bottle off a shelf and told me to balance it between us while we do it. For whatever reason there was a guy in the aisle so we had to wait for him to leave.

244,Lights in the sky,Dreams,"I just woke up from the worst dream. In the dream I was standing in the driveway with my friend and sister. I saw this star in the sky and it was moving quite fast, so I told my friend to check it out and we were just staring at it in astonishment. Then, there were these big colourful lights shooting across the sky and that’s when I knew things were bad. I went inside the garage and there my grandma was, praying. I had went in to pray too and I was crying, praying for my family and for God to have mercy on all of us. I went back out, the lights were still in the sky and suddenly me and a few friends, along with my sister, were in my garage and they said this has been happening for the past week. 

I went inside and my dad and I were going somewhere, he was on the computer and saying we were gonna go get more food and stuff for the plane. I had the feeling we were moving out. I grabbed my bag and I went to my room, packed things that are close to me and I went upstairs, then I woke up. 

This is the second dream I’ve had about the sky and the world going into panic, but this time, we were going to die.

My first dream like this was a few weeks ago. I was in my grandma’s room on the bed with my friend and we were looking out the window, blinds down but the things were slanted so we could see out.

247,My dream world is more real than reality,Dreams,"I've been able to lucid dream since I was a little kid. I also have exceptionally ""long"" dreams, and dreams within dreams. My dream world is so consistent and real that I'm starting to wonder if it's actually a parallel universe.

My dreams usually last for several days or a week in ""dream time"", but I've had ones that lasted for what seemed like months. In my dreams, I remember everything that happened in previous dreams - every bad experience, every good experience. I have a whole different set of memories.

My dream world consists of many countries and cities and they're always the same, same layouts and everything. I dream in the same place until I travel within a dream (for example, if I travel to Japan in a dream, I will be in Japan for all the following dreams until I travel again).

It's scary how consistent the dream worlds are. It's scary how consistent my memories are, too. If something horrible happens to me in a dream, I'll be suffering from the trauma of it for the next year or two of dreaming. It shapes who I am in the dream world.

Another interesting thing is that I have franchises and brands in my dreams that don't exist in real life, but are constantly updated in my dreams. For example, there's a movie series in my dreams called ""ripping through the shadows"" and it's on its fifth installment. Whenever a new installment comes out (usually once every 6 months) I'll go see it in theatres.

I literally feel like my dreams are more real than the reality I'm in. The only thing that reminds me that they're just dreams is that in unable to hurt myself - and I really try. I'm suicidal in real life, so I'm suicidal in dreams too. I often try to hurt myself but it doesn't work. The other people in my dreams can be hurt/killed, but I can't.

I can give more details if you want.

250,Recurring dream that I never understood.,Dreams,"I'm not sure if this is correct place to post it but here it goes.

When I was a kid about the age 6 till roughly about 13 I use to have the same dream. Whenever I had it the dream would repeat  every night for roughly a week.

In the dream there was a river bank with a steep drop and on the top of the bank a couple would always be standing looking down at a young boy playing near the water. Near the edge of the water a young boy was always playing trying to catch small fish with his hands, and after a few minutes he would stop and stand up. Shortly after the heads of people would start floating down the river and the couple and the boy would just stare at them as they floated with the current.

As the dream would repeat I would watch the events unfold and I was always one of the 3, but I could never react or control the person only watch thru their eyes.

Since the dream never deviated from it's set events I stopped been scared and would always try so hard to move (specially when I was the boy near the river), but it never changed I could only watch.",0,recurring dream never understood sure correct place post go kid age till roughly use dream whenever dream would repeat every night roughly week dream river bank steep drop top bank couple would always standing looking young boy playing near water near edge water young boy always playing trying catch small fish hand minute would stop stand shortly head people would start floating river couple boy would stare floated current dream would repeat would watch event unfold always one could never react control person watch thru eye since dream never deviated set event stopped scared would always try hard move specially boy near river never changed could watch

254,Weird Dream I had,Dreams,I had a dream last night where a car pulled up in front of my house. I watched as a drunk shirtless man stumbled towards the door and started violently kicking and banging at it. I opened it and the man just smiled and stumbled backwards towards his car quickly. I then noticed a rustling in the mailbox and looking inside revealed a British bulldog (which for some reason I identified as a beagle). I have two cats and live with my parents so my dad was absolutely opposed to the idea of having a dog. Without taking the dog out of the mailbox I checked outside again and noticed something on the ground. It seemed to be a ripped piece of cardboard with the words “He’s scared to poop” scribbled in the front.  Upon picking it up I realized that it was actually some sort of portfolio with a detailed description of the shirtless man’s life I don’t remember any of the details but I do know that it was filled with handwritten text from top to bottom for about 4 pages.,0,weird dream dream last night car pulled front house watched drunk shirtless man stumbled towards door started violently kicking banging opened man smiled stumbled backwards towards car quickly noticed rustling mailbox looking inside revealed british bulldog reason identified beagle two cat live parent dad absolutely opposed idea dog without taking dog mailbox checked outside noticed something ground seemed ripped piece cardboard word scared poop scribbled front upon picking realized actually sort portfolio detailed description shirtless man life remember detail know filled handwritten text top bottom page

256,Two recent dreams that are focused on angry ocean/flooding,Dreams,"I’m sitting down on a bench waiting to get called into court for some minor traffic issue when I realize the dude next to me is Robert Sapolsky, a neuroendocrinologist who has published a lot of great work and teaches at Stanford. He’s a really funny professor and I was watching a lecture of his on YouTube last night. In the dream, we talk a bit and I ask him if he’ll be teaching any classes in the future, but he says he’s too old. Disappointment. 

Then, one of my current teachers comes up and asks to talk with me in private. I’m nervous, because why in private? When we’re alone, she starts to cry and says that she’s worried she’s messing up the class curriculum and that the first exam was a mess. A bunch of students and I felt the exam was not accurate IRL, so I felt relieved that maybe she’d grade leniently. 

When I sit back down, I realize that I was supposed to go into the courtroom and sit down hours ago, and I’ve missed my court date. 

I leave with my parents and we teleport to a farm. This is where things get weird. The farm is on the beach, on the sand far from the water. To get down to the farm/beach, you have to walk down these stairs because it’s like a big wooden platform away from the water, like the way ocean front homes are designed. When looking at the farm, I admire the cute cows and the ocean. Then suddenly, while fully registering the image in front of me, I see massive waves throwing the cows everywhere. It’s like a tsunami, and the cows are crying. There’s also a horse getting swallowed and thrown around by the waves. The farmers are trying to save them but they’re also getting thrown around. (I read an article IRL about a man who was electrocuted while trying to save his horse during a flood). I panic because i want to help but don’t know how. The suffering makes me feel so much dread. Then, a massive wave launches two of the cows up on the wooden platform I’m standing on, and I go over to them. One of them immediately shits, and I feel so sad because that could mean he’s dead. But then he coughs, and water comes out. I go up to them and pet them, and they are so happy. LMFAO they are happy like my dogs, and I just stay with them because I’m amazed they’re alive. 

In a dream I had a few days ago, angry ocean was also involved. My boyfriend and I were trying to evacuate from some disaster when the road in front of us was covered in water. Even though it looked relatively shallow, I said no. He drove through anyway, and we got trapped. Massive tsunami waves start coming down on us and at some point I’m out of the car, getting launched up in the air from the waves. When I look down, I feel the terror of knowing that when I land, I will break my leg on something underneath the water and drown, then die. But when I land, I’m somehow fine, though struggling to stay afloat and breathe.

And then suddenly, the waves calm down, and I shove him out of the driver’s seat. I back out (and actually check my mirrors, which I feel like I never would do or remember doing in a dream?) and drive home. When I get home, I drive my car up the stairs (wtf?) and park it on my top floor in my house. I feel a sense of safety and relief.

257,Reoccuring Nightmare (please help find explanation),Dreams,"This is one of the few reoccurring nightmares that my friend has been having for the past week or so. We hope someone here could help us find answers.

She starts in a car, with her sister driving both of them to the sister's boyfriend's house. They arrive at a really tall building, about fourteen stories. This is realistic to the actual building she has visited.

She gets out of the car, and the sister says she got a parking ticket. When walking to the front doors of the building, she notices a girl hanging herself from the second-floor balcony. (In the latest dream, the girl was hanging from the first floor.)

She then looks up and sees a man jump off the edge of the building, and land dead in the parking lot. (In the latest dream, the man lands on top of the sister's car, also dead.)

When inside, the front desk lady and a male detective inform her that the girl had killed herself because she was raped. There was no explanation given for the man.

The front desk woman and detective man tell her that she is responsible for the people dying. Not as if she committed the crime, along the lines of ""this is all your fault."" Then she wakes up.

259,I dreamt of my dead body.,Dreams,"Last night I dreamt I was in a boat, my family was split  into two other boats so I wasn’t alone or anything. It was like the ocean ran thru the woods where my family lived growing up, the trees surrounding us were extremely tall, I can’t really explain it well but it was like the water was in a T shaped path, I was on one path facing the path in front of me where my parents boat was, and the path in the middle had my sisters boat. I’m terrified of the ocean and lakes, I would never jump in the water in reality, but I did in my dream, I felt nothing being in the water, the waves were wild but it didn’t move anything, from the outside the waves looked like they were raging but in the water if I hadn’t swam to the side of my sisters boat I would’ve stayed completely still. I don’t know what possessed me to go into the water but going up to my sisters boat there was a flipped over red shaft, and a body with its head facing down. I wasn’t scared, I just grabbed it’s wrist and pulled it away from the side of the boat, it looked like it was being pulled underneath. I’m not quite sure how I flipped it over, but when I moved the wet hair out of the way, I saw myself. I was dead. I don’t know what happened after that, I just remember waking up. 

I’ve been struggling with depression and recently my family has become aware. Could this be because of that? I don’t know how to interpret this, I don’t know what it means.

265,I had a dream I can't forget.,Dreams,"It's not recurring, it just plays in my mind start to finish a lot, especially the ending.

It's basically 35 years in Victorian London, birth to death.

I was born a boy into a noble family of buisnessmen I'm pretty sure. I can see it all in my mind, but I can't explain it very well. I'm an only child, as far as I know.

At age about 10, I pick up a love for poetry and literature, not counting and buisness. My family are furious when they find out and burn or sell all of my novels and non-buisness related books.

At 15, I pick up that love again, except this time I hide it better. At 16, I fall in love with a gardener of the household. We ran away into the city in the early dusk of winter, the day after I turned 17.

I become a poet, he is still a gardener, but part-time in a different and smaller household.

Poetry doesn't sustain me enough, so I begin working as a train conductor when I'm about 25 under an alias. You know, checking tickets, screaming 'all aboard' when the train is about to leave, etc. In my free time I still write poetry and short stories inspired by the never sleeping Victorian city. I married a girl who moved from the countryside that raised to be a housewife. Had a few kids, but there was never anything romantic. I lied about longer work nights and going to an inn to drink, when in reality, I fucked the gardener, talked about life, etc. Anything a gay couple would do in 18th century London. Just like Oscar Wilde.

10 years go by, still madly in love with the gardener. But someone (probably my wife) ratted on us that I'm a runaway noble and that I practice homosexual acts with a common servant.

I was executed by hanging the next week after refusing treatment for being gay and not wanting to return to my parents, as well as collapsing their entire buisness because they had no other heirs and my father grew too ill to manage it. And because he trusted no-one, it imploded.

I'm a bi guy leaning toward men, so thats where the gay comes from.

267,Reoccurring place...,Dreams,"Goodmorning, let me lead with the ""I'm on mobile"" spiel. 

Now, for a little backstory, I served in the military for several years and married military so I moved away from my tiny hometown of 800 people and haven't been back except for the occasional visit. 

I regularly have this dream... or rather it's a different dream everytime but I always end up at the same place. I don't really recognize it as being somewhere in the real world but dream me recognizes it as the way into my hometown. It's a bridge with pine trees on a steep bank on one side and a body of water on the other. The bridge is always out with big signs warning that the bridge is under construction. 

I am never with the same people when we approach the bridge and sometimes I'm alone. I have been in every vehicle you can imagine when I approach the bridge. Sometimes I try to maneuver the bridge (go around, get up my speed and try to jump the gap, climb down and try to climb up the other side, etc.). Sometimes I just turn around and try to find another way into town. I never get into town before I wake up. 

I have never had reoccurring dreams before and I just wondered if it means anything.

268,Constant Dream Flashbacks?,Dreams,"This has been a constant for me for years now. I have very vivid and sometimes lucid dreams on a nightly basis. I forget them quite often but there will be some I will remember for a day or so and then forget about. Some I have remembered for years.

Throughout my day though, if my brain is idle and I’m not thinking of anything in particular I will get snapshots of dreams. Some years old, ones I hadn’t thought of for literally years. I can recall moments from, if I had to guess, on a good day, maybe 50-70 different dreams. But regularly, probably 15-20.

I used to have a job where I did something very monotonous for hours, and they would all pop into my head, one after another for as long as I was working. And it would just be a flash. A color scheme of a room accompanied by a feeling. Or an entire sequence of a story. Memories of physical touch. All of these flashbacks are very vivid for me, even if I can’t recall the exact scene in the dream. As I’m writing this I just had 4 pop into my head. 

I’m wondering if anyone else experiences something similar? I’ve explained it to my sister, who also dreams like me, and she seems to get it but I don’t think it happens to her as much or as constantly as me.

271,The World Spider (Series) (Night 2),Dreams,"**This is the second in the series of dreams.**I have returned to stand before the spider, but this time all is not as silent as before. It is cold, dark, but not quite quiet and not quite lonely. I look around me and I am flanked on all sides by men and women bearing tattoos of the spider. Tattoos imprinted on their foreheads seem to move, bowing before the spider itself. The people are doing as the spider wills, but not, seemingly, from its direct command.  


But while the tattoos of the spider bow before it, the Children of Man bow before me. I see through their eyes, a completed vision giving me a third-person sight of my own naked body. A massive tattoo of the spider covers my entire back. Two of the tattoos legs reach out to my limbs. Two legs per arm, two legs per leg. The tips of the legs end on opposite sides of my limbs, a spider leg ending on the front and another on the back of my shoulders, the same for my hips. Chains connect to the ends of the spider's legs, spiraling down my arms and legs to end at a shackle tattooed around my wrists and ankles  


.It is then that the spider speaks to me and a compulsion wracks my body. I fall to my knees and bow my head before the entity before me as it speaks in a voice steeped in power. The ancientness of the spider echoes in my mind with the voice that I can not hear, erasing the doubt of its power as it washes over me. Like a good servant, I bathe in the power of its voice and heed its every word. Doting diligently on them with every bit of my attention.  


The spider gives no commands, no cryptic verses, no demand to be worshipped. Rather… it tells me a story. It tells me a story of an empty void with only it to occupy the endless nothingness. It tells me of how it saw the potential for many things to exist, and in the infinite eons between then and not long ago, it spun a web. A web that spans the universe... Neigh… a web that MAKES the universe. The twinkling morning dew hanging from the delicate yet infinitely grand strands of silk made the galaxies, and all that exists in between made the worlds and stars that occupy our universe.  


I see in that moment that the web spun by this spider is something grander than I could ever imagine. The very cosmos… I weep. Not in pity for the spider being trapped. But out of woe that anybody would want to trap something so beautiful. But then I see it. As the Children of Man bow to me, and I bow to the spider, a chain is completed. No names exist on the chainlinks and again the spider has will over its own silk. The Earth itself shakes, the abdomen shuttering causing landslides as the web snaps. Out of the Earth shoots the leg, seemingly moving slowly due to its size, but moving faster than any human could hope too even with the assistance of technology.  


I stare in awe, the Children of Man around me exclaiming as one of the legs is freed. As it happens I feel a strange sensation pass over me, a chill up my spine, the feeling of waves hitting my skin. I see in the eyes of the Children of Man that my tattoos are moving with the spider. The abdomen tattoo is raised from my back and one of the chains on my right arm is broken. Now a very real chain is linked to my arm and hanging to the ground. I barely noticed that it transitions smoothly from metal to tattoo as it meets my skin, I am too absorbed in the voice of the spider congratulating me for my hard work.  


As it says this I hear my voice leaving my mouth, repeating the same to the Children of Man. I feel stronger, and in that strength, I sense the gift of the spider offering me whatever I wish so long as I continue my “hard work”. Before I can really take this in… I see it… Specifically, I see her. An elderly woman sitting upon the leg of the spider, rocking back and forth on its leg and knitting something I can’t quite see. But as my vision clears it becomes obvious what it is she is knitting. It’s the link of a chain, made from the silk of the grand spider before me.  


I take in her form. But unlike the spider, I feel greatly disconnected from her. The elderly lady is spiderlike as well, with eight unfeeling eyes staring out at me from under a shawl.

273,Random Events Leasing Up To A Zombie Apocalypse,Dreams,"It was early evening hours. This man was in an old antique diner having a meal. He was close friends with the owner, so had a special seat right by the bar. 
After finishing up his meal, he realized the diner was surprisingly empty. 3 tall men in suits walk in. Bald head, stocky, at least 6 ft 2 each. 
They walk up to the man, kindly but firmly, shake his hand. The man said ... I'm not looking for trouble, I'm just going to see myself out now... The man exits the diner through the back door

As the man walks to his car, he looks up to the sky, only to see a small 2 passenger plane on fire, crashing down to earth! It crashed in the middle of a 4 lane road, relatively close to where he parked his car. As he goes to his car to get out of there he realizes he should try to help. He decides to do his best and help people involved in the crash. As he approaches the airplane, he realizes there's probably gasoline in the plane, and plane is on fire! He does a full 180 and sprints away. The plane blows up as he's sprinting for safety. 

After the plane blows up, he goes back and tries to help people who were in the cars when the airplane dropped. But those cars are now catching on fire too. The man decided it is best to wait a little bit and move his car away, to a safer distance. As chaos begins to unravel, he sees people on fire, running towards other people and attacking them. He’s watching the carnage unfold from a safe distance. He sees people who aren't on fire, full on Olympic sprinting, chasing other people and tackling them, and attacking them. BITING THEM  🧟‍♂️ Quickly he makes the connection and realizes this is a Zombie Apocalypse. 

He puts his car in reverse, drives through the diner, drives through the back Door, smashes the wall, to avoid the accident, and does a great freaking left turn drift on to the highway. There's a massive cliff just after the last traffic light. He realizes that now there are zombies everywhere. He calls his wife, telling her they're going up north to the wives mothers house, to fill up gas and stock up on groceries before the news spread! He passes the cliff on the highway, and his on his way to get his wife!

I gently put it down on the table and it breaks. Hands to my mouth I gasp and look from the mug to my friend. Her expression one of shock and betrayal.     


The situation was a little funny actually and I chuckled. She narrows her eyes at me as I hold back the laughter. Hands still to my mouth, I try to say ""I'm so sorry.""     


You know how when you know you shouldn't laugh at something and trying to hold it in only makes it funnier? I cracked and laughed so hard I actually woke myself up still laughing.

278,Crazy ride of twists and turns,Dreams,"Going to post this here before I forget everything. 

Luke (Gilmore Girls) is my mom's boyfriend. He got injured, and is housebound for the day but set to go back to his regular schedule the next day. It's his birthday coming up that weekend, and some people from Stars Hollow are gathered together planning a party and are wondering how to get everything set up without him noticing. I mention something about my mom keeping him busy. 

We are now at my grandparent's old house, introducing Luke to my mom's side of the family. Something I say or do causes me and my mom to fight, so I lock myself in the bathroom. I then start pleasuring myself (???) first just manually but then also with the handle of a hairbrush that I can only insert in about a centimeter before I hit some kind of ""wall"" preventing me to put it any further. 

My mom then comes back screaming at me, saying she knows what I'm doing. I freak out and get everything straightened out, and when I get out, she says something about how I've been doing inappropriate things to a toddler. There's a psychologist in the kitchen who has diagnosed me with some sort of ""lesbian love disorder"" (those aren't the exact words there are a couple psychology words in between lesbian and love that I can't remember), but the gist of the disorder is that I, as a lesbian (actually bi, but didn't correct) who hasn't ever been in a romantic relationship, nor hasn't had any loving moments with anyone else recently, thought it was appropriate to project those feelings onto a little girl, because if I did certain things to her, then she would love me back.

Then it turned into a discussion onto why it was ok (to the psychologist) for a 15yo boy to have sexual relations with someone with a large age difference (think like 10 years here), but it wasn't ok for girls. Don't ask for any arguments for or against, I can't remember any. 

The next few moments are viewed like CCTV footage. A group of me and 5 or 6 people and myself are gathered in the kitchen. We step outside for a moment, and when we come back in, an extra person is with us. He's dressed in an all-tan umpire uniform. He even carried a wooden baseball bat.

I don't know how, but it took me a moment to realize he was there. I was totally calm when I pointed him out (I'm creeped out by him now, he looked totally creepy), but then I ended up asking him if I could choose who to kill. He nodded, and I pointed to all but myself and two people. How did he kill them, you may ask? With a baseball bat. And somehow I managed to touch the baseball bat, which would make me suspect to investigation. 

I then run off with the 2 other survivors where we sit in a field just outside the city.

283,Terrifying False Awakening Loop,Dreams,"I just woke up from another loop of terrifying false awakenings. I went down for a nap, and was out for just over an hour, but the dream felt like hours upon hours.

In it, I'd gone down for this same nap, aware that my fiance finishes at 9pm but will be visiting his parents before coming home (all true). The first time I 'woke up', I was feeling really groggy and spacy, and I didn't really know what I was doing but I was tearing up paper next to the bed. Then I woke up again. I could hear people in the house but felt too groggy to do anything. I was fighting my body, but it didn't want to move. I had a blindfold on (in real life I'd gone to sleep with a sleep mask) and I fought my arms to peel it off, and I could see the room with the torn paper from before but no voices from people in the house. That tipped me off that I was having false awakenings.

So from then on, I was aware that I was having these dreams full of dread, and knew I just had to wait for my partner to get home. So I still have awakenings, but I remember that the past ones have happened and they feel relevant to the current situation. When he is home (like when we sleep at night), I know I can start screaming in terror at this point and eventually it'll come out of my actual body and he'll actually wake me up. In the dreams, it's like I try to scream but nothing comes out, so I try and try again, until it's loud enough to""break through the dream"".

I tried screaming, in case I'd slept until my partner got home, but my voice was so hoarse. Then I woke up again. Still filled with dread. I tried to wander through the house, and I kept pulling at the thing on my eyes. I could see, but I knew what I was seeing wasn't real. Occassionally when I could pull the thing off my eyes, I could see our real house, and that's when I tried grounding techniques. But then it went again, so I just screamed in terror. Woke again. Repeated. And again. And again.

I was then aware that my phone was near me as I slept, so in this haze of terror, I tried grabbing it. It wasn't any use because I was a mix of groggy and stuck trying to pull the blindfold off. I tried using voice commands to call my partner, but again, my voice was hardly working. I felt terrified. Awake again. It's dark now, surely he'll be home soon. I try screaming again, but it's so hoarse. I then hear my phone ringing and am so grateful. I manage to answer it, and it's my partner saying he's just leaving work. I try screaming things like ""help"" "" stuck"" and ""dream"" because I know that my real world partner will know I'm caught in a night terror and come home to help. But it's silent on the phone, I think because my voice wasn't working.

Snap awake again. My housemate that moved out earlier this week is in the house. I try screaming, and it doesn't work. I get up, groggy and blindfolded but seeing a 'false' house. I'm feeling along the walls, trying to scream, hoping that outside of the dream, she's actually in our house and I'm actually screaming and sleepwalking. But I pull off the blind and see the house is empty. Awake again. I try fumble through the house again screaming and pulling at the blindfold. Awake again. I groggily try to move off the bed covered in shredded paper and all the things I knocked over in previous attempts to get help, and I just sob. But then I hear the front door and hope to God it's my partner here to wake me up - maybe the phone call happened in real life. Try to get up screaming. Wake up. I hear the door again, and try screaming. I try and try and he's not hearing. But then he walks into the room and his face drops as he asks what happened. The dream then turns, and all of a suddensuddena winged evil creature version of himself on top of me. I scream as loudly as possible and...

Finally wake up for real. Day time. Covered in sweat. Heart racing. My dream had gone on from at least 3.30pm to 11pm when he was home, so I checked the time and it'd only been an hour. I'm more exhausted then when I went to nap. The heat from the pounding heart has worn off now, so now I'm covered in sweat and freezing. The worst part is that this isn't uncommon for me.

284,the skilful man - dream story,Dreams,"i had an interesting bitter sweet dream last night.

i was a young guy who had the power to run fast and skilfully. i met a band of teenagers who were trying to give pop bottles and other bits and bobs to a charity event but they wouldn't allow them cause they caused trouble by not doing it right. things were unorganised, wires were tangled it was a mess. so i decided to help them out. i organised them, untangled the wires and set them up so they wont get tangled again and i set up a system which could run with my running skills. i ran and ran and they eventually succeeded.

it kept going for years until they had a prosperous business and didn't need my help anymore since they invented machines which do the job for me. i wasn't needed so i felt i was needed elsewhere so i said goodbye. they begged me to stay so i told them a story of a previous place i had been. in the past i helped a race of eagles which lived in the water but they couldn't swim very well. i swam graciously to help them. then they invented boats and forgot about me since i wasn't needed.

i went elsewhere in sadness to find a race of giant ogre like people who lived in the jungles which were having troubles of their own. i helped them learn how to travel their home by swinging on the vines and helped them make friends with a local tribe which had a business which was failing so they could work together and everything was well. i left before they noticed as were too happy now to notice, they didn't need me anymore. i realised there is other places i am needed so i don't need to worry about staying and eventually i will find my true place.

so i left the teenagers and went to the skies. in the skies there were a race of sea creatures and it was like the beach but in the sky with clouds. they were also trying to make a business run by swirling clouds into shapes of bottles of ketchup and soup and other products. i helped them change the colours of the clouds and swirled them by flying gracefully in the sky as usual. they adored me and the business grew and grew as it did before until people barely noticed me as it was so busy but i didn't feel unloved this time.

and one day, as i was busy helping out, a little young woman flickered her eyelashes at me. i was surprised as i never had a reaction to me to be anything like that before. i shifted over and we got chatting. she said she fancied me and one thing led to another and years later we got married and had 3 children. 2 girls and a boy. when the first girl was a young teenager, the second girl about 10 years old and the boy about 4 i disappeared never to be seen again. my wife cried to my children asking why but my children didn't cry. my children reminded her of the things i had said many times. how i was helping cause my powers were needed in the world and there is always a sorry soul i need to help. if i stopped it would be unfair on the ones who needed me. this was my purpose in life. my wife understood and smiled through her tears. the end

it was told like a story with some parts being able to be done by my own body but in the mind of the character and other parts like the ending being told through a story book with watercolour illustrations. it was bizarre but i got great feeling of sadness, joy and eventually satisfaction throughout. i feel like i have watched a beautiful movie.",0,skilful man dream story interesting bitter sweet dream last night young guy power run fast skilfully met band teenager trying give pop bottle bit bob charity event allow cause caused trouble right thing unorganised wire tangled mess decided help organised untangled wire set wont get tangled set system could run running skill ran ran eventually succeeded kept going year prosperous business need help anymore since invented machine job needed felt needed elsewhere said goodbye begged stay told story previous place past helped race eagle lived water swim well swam graciously help invented boat forgot since needed went elsewhere sadness find race giant ogre like people lived jungle trouble helped learn travel home swinging vine helped make friend local tribe business failing could work together everything well left noticed happy notice need anymore realised place needed need worry staying eventually find true place left teenager went sky sky race sea creature like beach sky cloud also trying make business run swirling cloud shape bottle ketchup soup product helped change colour cloud swirled flying gracefully sky usual adored business grew grew people barely noticed busy feel unloved time one day busy helping little young woman flickered eyelash surprised never reaction anything like shifted got chatting said fancied one thing led another year later got married child girl boy first girl young teenager second girl year old boy disappeared never seen wife cried child asking child cry child reminded thing said many time helping cause power needed world always sorry soul need help stopped would unfair one needed purpose life wife understood smiled tear end told like story part able done body mind character part like ending told story book watercolour illustration bizarre got great feeling sadness joy eventually satisfaction throughout feel like watched beautiful movie
285,"Do you feel a certain, consistent emotion in some of your deepest and most vivid dreams? Do you sometimes have “flashbacks” to these dreams randomly while awake?",Dreams,"Hello, everyone.
I’ve been deeply obsessed with this emotion I get sometimes when I dream. I only really get it (or remember it) when I have dreams so vivid, they feel like real life. Since they’re so realistic, sometimes I get ‘flashbacks’ randomly during the day. During these ‘flashbacks’, I first feel the emotion or feeling I get during the dream very strongly for a few seconds and then I remember certain details of the dream. Sometimes I remember dreams I have completely forgotten about and haven’t had in months or even years. Sometimes the details are vague and hazy, while other times they’re crystal clear. I enjoy the emotion, somewhat, and I do tend to seek it out. It’s a very addicting feeling, but it also has a dark side to it as well. I am not sure how to describe it, I feel like attaching any type of label or comparison to it would taint your understanding of it, although I guess I would say it’s similar to nostalgia or even melancholia at times, but it’s much more complex than I can understand. It’s extremely confusing but intriguing to me. 
I was wondering if anyone else experiences this as well. Not a day goes by where I don’t think about this feeling and why I get it when I dream. 
I’ve been obsessing over this for years, it has even caused a bit of inner turmoil in my life, but I do overall enjoy sleeping and dreaming because of it.

Does this happen to you as well?",0,feel certain consistent emotion deepest vivid dream sometimes flashback dream randomly awake hello everyone deeply obsessed emotion get sometimes dream really get remember dream vivid feel like real life since realistic sometimes get flashback randomly day flashback first feel emotion feeling get dream strongly second remember certain detail dream sometimes remember dream completely forgotten month even year sometimes detail vague hazy time crystal clear enjoy emotion somewhat tend seek addicting feeling also dark side well sure describe feel like attaching type label comparison would taint understanding although guess would say similar nostalgia even melancholia time much complex understand extremely confusing intriguing wondering anyone else experience well day go think feeling get dream obsessing year even caused bit inner turmoil life overall enjoy sleeping dreaming guy think happen well

287,Dreams do come true. I sort of have prophetic dreams or something like they come true or really happen .,Dreams,"1. I had a dream that i was riding a motorcycle towards my old school, when i looked to my right, there were about two hippopotamuses walking around the grass field then i saw my pre-school teacher maa'm cora waving at me. The morning of that day, i went out of my bedroom and my siblings were at the living room watching animal planet about hippos. This was really weird but what were the chances.
2. I had a dream that i went to visit my old high school, i was walking around the campus till i arrived at a newly constructed building, i went up the new building's stairs and found my way to a bathroom stall, i remember checking out the doors and thought to myself, ""what kind of new building is this?"" since some of the stall doors are broken. Back to real life, about two weeks later, i visited my hometown for Christmas break, My mom asked me to go with her to my high school where my brother now goes to for a parent-teacher meeting. So we arrived and it has been about 3 years since I last visited the school, we were headed towards a new building, I thought to myself, this feels like deja vu. Then i remembered the dream. I asked my brother, is your room upstairs? he said, ""yeah"" My mind was full of anticipation as we went up the stairs. I told my brother that I had a dream about this place, He says ""What?"" As we were walking up the stairs, ""I've been here already."" I said to myself. Then I told him, ""Is there a bathroom at the end of these stairs?""  And at the end of the stairs there was a bathroom door. I turned to my brother and asked ""are the doors inside made of wood and some are broken?"" And I saw his eyes glow open in amazement as he said, ""how did you know??"" and i went, ""i'm psychic"" jokingly 
3. One time I dreamed that my roommate took her bag and spilled all the contents on the bed. I woke up, my roommate was already up, preparing her things to go out. Then she took her bag and spilled all the contents on the bed to transfer it to her other bag. cool

I go into my laundry room, peek through the blinds covering the window, and managed to see a small, black military assault helicopter (like you would see in FarCry 5, for example) with dual gatlings on it, absolutely no running lights, and it is flying at maybe 200ft above ground level, circling the street in front of my house. ""What the hell?!""

My grandmother and mother are in the dream, and I struggle to get them to stop being stubborn, listen to me, and get in one of the bedrooms at the back of the house. Making sure all the lights are off, I peek out through the living room blinds just as this helicopter opens fire on something on the street. All I can see is a car parked on the street out front, it's doors open, but no occupants in sight, when chunks of concrete explode upward as high velocity rounds rapidly strike the sidewalk and trace up to hit something out of sight.

I yell for everyone to get down and stay in the back room, then heed my own advise and take cover in the hall. Once the fire stops, I peek around the corner through the kitchen and my front door is open, but I somehow know the security door is still intact and closed. That doesn't matter, as a clawed, undead white hand curls around the edge of the open inner door and a hunching weight, with long rotting black hair, is already inside the house, somehow having phased through the steel security door. ""Ah, shit..."" I decide I don't like where this has gone and want to try a redo, so I use **Rewind** and go back several minutes.

The helicopter has just started circling, I've gotten everyone secreted into the back bedroom, and am now in my bedroom. I open a gun safe and take out my actual .45 Cal 1911, slip the two extra 10rd magazines into my left shorts pocket, insert the third and rack the slide. Safety off, I wait in the kitchen for the weight. But things go differently. The helicopter starts shooting at the weight as it is in front of my front door. My mom, stubbornly curious, wants to know what is going on and comes out of the bedroom, I yell for her to get back just as she lines up with the front door and dozens upon dozens of rounds go through the door and strike my mom. _Wait, it wasn't supposed to go like that!_ ""Crap!"" I **Rewind** the dream again.

At the point where I've gotten everyone hidden away and safe, I lock the bedroom door from the outside, and go into my bedroom. The wall opens up, the desk sliding away, showing a very cool futuristic armory like something Tony Stark would have built for the Punisher. I get these hand guns that resemble an H&K USP Match (the gun used by Lara Croft), except mine are all black with red slides, and are the size of my forearm. I load subspace magazines into four of them, the magazines drawing from a remote, infinite ammo supply that will automatically feed into the guns, holster two on my thighs and another two on my hips, the extra two being backups in case one set overheats from using full auto for too long. ""No more Mr Nice Guy.""

I go to the front door, quietly open it and the security door, then rush outside and draw a set of pistols. There are several weights who immediately take notice and move to attack me. The helicopter is already working on a pack of them up the street. I take aim and start taking down weights one at a time, my guns on full auto, but using short bursts for accuracy. I blow the head off one, the left arm and left chest of another, and so on, until there are no more weights. I check my guns for overheating and they are fine. I look up and this massive, red eyed Decepticon-like thing is hovering in the sky. ""Oh, come on...""

The helicopter is out of ammo and backs off, I somehow know backup is on the way but it won't get here in time. There are two guys on the ground in, oddly enough, S.T.A.R.S. uniforms, but they're outclassed by the hovering robot. I holster the first set of guns, draw the second, hit a switch that cycles my ammo to a different type, select full auto, and open fire on the robot. I'm actually damaging it, but it's slow going. It starts firing back at me, but I dodge it's shots, strafing left and right, and eventually outright flying into the air and dodging fire in the sky. My guns are getting hot, the bad guy still has half his health, and something starts shooting me in the back. I yell for the guys on the ground to get whatever is shooting at me, concentrating on the hovering robot. I can see three helicopters in the distance. I have to hold out just a couple minutes longer until they get here--

And the dream fades and I wake up. What the crap?! I didn't get to see the giant robot go down. I did, however, immediately realize I was breathing like I had been running, though, which is probably why I woke up. This all happened during a lousy two hour nap.",0,assault helicopter monster big hand gun getting spotty sleep last night decided take nap earlier evening since day work early tomorrow point became aware dreaming around dream gotten go bathroom heard strange noise sounded like wash helicopter propeller go laundry room peek blind covering window managed see small black military assault helicopter like would see farcry example dual gatling absolutely running light flying maybe ft ground level circling street front house hell grandmother mother dream struggle get stop stubborn listen get one bedroom back house making sure light peek living room blind helicopter open fire something street see car parked street front door open occupant sight chunk concrete explode upward high velocity round rapidly strike sidewalk trace hit something sight yell everyone get stay back room heed advise take cover hall fire stop peek around corner kitchen front door open somehow know security door still intact closed matter clawed undead white hand curl around edge open inner door hunching weight long rotting black hair already inside house somehow phased steel security door ah shit decide like gone want try redo use rewind go back several minute helicopter started circling gotten everyone secreted back bedroom bedroom open gun safe take actual cal slip two extra rd magazine left short pocket insert third rack slide safety wait kitchen weight thing go differently helicopter start shooting weight front front door mom stubbornly curious want know going come bedroom yell get back line front door dozen upon dozen round go door strike mom wait supposed go like crap rewind dream point gotten everyone hidden away safe lock bedroom door outside go bedroom wall open desk sliding away showing cool futuristic armory like something tony stark would built punisher get hand gun resemble h k usp match gun used lara croft except mine black red slide size forearm load subspace magazine four magazine drawing remote infinite ammo supply automatically feed gun holster two thigh another two hip extra two backup case one set overheats using full auto long mr nice guy go front door quietly open security door rush outside draw set pistol several weight immediately take notice move attack helicopter already working pack street take aim start taking weight one time gun full auto using short burst accuracy blow head one left arm left chest another weight check gun overheating fine look massive red eyed decepticon like thing hovering sky oh come helicopter ammo back somehow know backup way get time two guy ground oddly enough r uniform outclassed hovering robot holster first set gun draw second hit switch cycle ammo different type select full auto open fire robot actually damaging slow going start firing back dodge shot strafing left right eventually outright flying air dodging fire sky gun getting hot bad guy still half health something start shooting back yell guy ground get whatever shooting concentrating hovering robot see three helicopter distance hold couple minute longer get dream fade wake crap get see giant robot go however immediately realize breathing like running though probably woke happened lousy two hour nap
290,I don’t have nightmares that often and usually they are aren’t that scary. But this one stood out from the rest.,Dreams,"This along with another dream sticks out from the rest. Basically in this dream, I was inside a house. It wasn’t abandoned. It was furnished and looked like somebody was already living there, but it wasn’t mine. The house was two stores and at the time my house wasn’t ( or the house I live in now ). I was in my pajamas as-well like I was comfortable being in that house. My vision looked like what camera footage looked like at night. A dark green. And I was running or hiding from this guy. I didn’t see his face ( or maybe I forgot what this guy look like) but I think I remember what he wore. He wore a white shirt with sleeves that had lines over it and Kahkis.

Anyways, I was trying to run or hide or maybe both from this guy. There were stairs right in-front of the kitchen, but for some reason I couldn’t go up there. When the guy saw me, he would wrap his arms around me. Like a hug but it was more aggressive. Like he once he had me he didn’t want to let me go. I would try to scream but nothing would come out as if I lost my voice at that moment. I would try to scream out of the top of my lungs, but it was just silence that would come out. And then everything faded to snow like a television screen. Like it was my dream’s way of saying ‘Game over’. 

I would try again and again to escape from this man but It always ended with his arms around me. Tightly. Almost crushing me. Finally, I woke up from that nightmare. I know it isn’t that scary to most but that dream for some reason sticks out to me.",0,nightmare often usually scary one stood rest along another dream stick rest basically dream inside house abandoned furnished looked like somebody already living mine house two store time house house live pajama well like comfortable house vision looked like camera footage looked like night dark green running hiding guy see face maybe forgot guy look like think remember wore wore white shirt sleeve line kahkis anyways trying run hide maybe guy stair right front kitchen reason go guy saw would wrap arm around like hug aggressive like want let go would try scream nothing would come lost voice moment would try scream top lung silence would come everything faded snow like television screen like dream way saying game would try escape man always ended arm around tightly almost crushing finally woke nightmare know scary dream reason stick
291,Three swans,Dreams,"I had a dream. I saw three white swans swimming in a lake in the darkness. The water was blacker than night, and thicker than maple syrup. As they swam, one of the swans bent down and drank from the water. It began to convulse, and after a few moments it died. Slowly the body sank beneath the surface. The other two swans swam away to the other side of the lake. One of the remaining swans spread it's wings and tried to fly away, terrified. But the dark water clung to it's wings, and it was pulled back down as it struggled to leave. During the struggle, it sank under, never to resurface. The last swan saw all that had happened, and did not try to drink from the water, and it did not try to leave. Instead, it lifted it's head and began to sing.

292,Teeth Dreams,Dreams,"I don’t dream very often, but when I do I usually dream about my teeth falling out. In my dream I just open my mouth and all my teeth fall out at once. Since it’s not realistic for all your teeth to fall out like that, I’m able to tell that I’m dreaming. 

Recently I had another teeth dream, but this one was way more realistic. Only one tooth fell out. It felt a little bit loose and so I kept wiggling it. I eventually wiggled it too much and it came out. I panicked and went to the dentist to get a dental implant so I wouldn’t just have gap. The dentist said they couldn’t do the implant.

293,Dream in which I was chasing myself.. need help interpreting.,Dreams,I was wondering if you could help interpret this dream I had. I was exploring an underground tunnel system with my father. The tunnel had walk ways on both sides and a river in the middle filled with red and blue fish. all of the sudden we approach this open door to a lake with a wall of water separating us from the lake then I spotted a large shark that was swimming around which quickly made a B line for me and we both took off running as we ran back down the path. I decided to turn around to see if it had followed and instead of a shark I saw myself with a blank stare and wide eyes sprinting at me. At this point I remember jumping through one of the walls and it brought me to an old room filled with books and a colorful carpet. There in the middle of the room sat a man that looked like an old professor with spectacles and a mustache I remember him saying something but I don’t know what.. soon after I woke up.

295,Mass Shooter Dream,Dreams,"I had a pretty disturbing, but very realistic dream last night, where I was a mass shooter in an office building. For context, I'm female, in my 30s.

Anyways, the dream basically started with me sitting in a bathroom stall with a pistol. I was on the first floor of a large office building and was waiting for the man in the stall besude me to leave as I didn't want him to know I was there since I was a girl, and obviously had a gun.

After he left, I got my wits about me and left the bathroom, and it started. I'll spare details, but basically I worked methodically, shooting anyone who came across my path. I worked my way up the floors until about the fifth floor before I pulled the fire alarm to pick people off as they tried to leave.

In the end, I had managed to kill 60 people. I headed back downstairs and there was a walkway on the first floor between two buildings, with a mezzanine. As I was moving between buildings, I was shot by a police sniper who was in the mezzanine. I was hit in the shoulder, and was subsequently arrested. For some reason my dream spent a lot of time on this. When I was shot I fell pretty hard, started bleeding profusely and physically couldn't get up. It was the first time in my dream I was feeling emotion, and it was just frustration that my legs weren't working well and my arm was useless. I was a little worried about bleeding out, but it was more just me being mad I got shot. The police officer who shot me was an old co worker of mine in the real world, but I didn't make the connection in the dream. This was the most realistic feeling part of the dream.

My dream skipped essentially to the trial phase. My lawyer (who is a current coworker of mine in the real world) really had no defense because it was obvious I had done it. But he essentially was trying to blame the victims a bit, asking how a 95lb woman (I don't weigh that, but apparently I did in my dream) was able to kill 60 people with a pistol over the course of 45 minutes without someone just tackling her.

Then, I woke up. A little disturbed. When I was younger I had a decent obsession with mass shootings. I found them intriguing and may have been a teeny bit obsessed with researching them, but I've since grown out of that.

I had not taken any drugs, nor had i watched anything relating to a mass shooting beforehand.

Does that dream mean anything, or was it just totally random?

Edit: forgot to mention. Just before the court scene there was a quick part where I met with my lawyer. For some reason it was in my parents living room. In my dream I was able to realise from this odd part that I was dreaming, but did not wake up or anything. This often happens in my dream where something out of left field happens and I realise I'm dreaming, but have no control and it just continues.",0,mass shooter dream pretty disturbing realistic dream last night mass shooter office building context female anyways dream basically started sitting bathroom stall pistol first floor large office building waiting man stall besude leave want know since girl obviously gun left got wit left bathroom started spare detail basically worked methodically shooting anyone came across path worked way floor fifth floor pulled fire alarm pick people tried leave end managed kill people headed back downstairs walkway first floor two building mezzanine moving building shot police sniper mezzanine hit shoulder subsequently arrested reason dream spent lot time shot fell pretty hard started bleeding profusely physically get first time dream feeling emotion frustration leg working well arm useless little worried bleeding mad got shot police officer shot old co worker mine real world make connection dream realistic feeling part dream dream skipped essentially trial phase lawyer current coworker mine real world really defense obvious done essentially trying blame victim bit asking lb woman weigh apparently dream able kill people pistol course minute without someone tackling woke little disturbed younger decent obsession mass shooting found intriguing may teeny bit obsessed researching since grown taken drug watched anything relating mass shooting beforehand dream mean anything totally random edit forgot mention court scene quick part met lawyer reason parent living room dream able realise odd part dreaming wake anything often happens dream something left field happens realise dreaming control continues
296,She vacuumed her insides out,Dreams,"This is my first time on this sub. Apologize for formatting as I’m on mobile. I’m not sure if I need to add these but:

TW/CW: mention of self harm. 

I woke up genuinely disturbed about my dream for the first time in a while. 

The overall dream felt like I was watching a movie, but the main character switched between me watching the movie with a male version of me as a main character at times, and at other times it felt like I was actually experiencing the movie as myself. 

It started with me watching the “movie” as an outsider. A man and woman were taking turns in a duet of an Adele song. 

All of a sudden I’m in it, as myself, and I’m getting ready at a house with the woman from the duet, as if we are friends. Doing makeup, switching clothes, etc. then she starts singing the Adele song. And she starts slashing herself with a razor (the small kind you use in safety razors). The slashes are more like scratches, nothing deep, barely enough to make her bleed. But they’re across her chest and arms and she look happy, almost elated, as she’s singing and spinning around slashing herself. 

All of a sudden now she looks different. She’s now naked, heavy-set around the middle of her body, longer hair and looks older. Her torso is open and I stare in terror as she starts vacuuming out her intestines with a vacuum hose. Still smiling in ecstasy, still spinning around like she’s happy and dancing. She finally finished emptying herself out and is standing there, gaping open and alive. She dances across the living room, out a sliding door, and collapses in the backyard on a wooden deck. 

I woke up in the dream and described, Wizard of Oz-style to people I guess I know about the “movie” I dreamed about (“you were there, and you were there!”) The people I was talking to were the woman and the man from the beginning of the dream.",0,vacuumed inside first time sub apologize formatting mobile sure need add tw cw mention self harm woke genuinely disturbed dream first time overall dream felt like watching movie main character switched watching movie male version main character time time felt like actually experiencing movie started watching movie outsider man woman taking turn duet adele song sudden getting ready house woman duet friend makeup switching clothes etc start singing adele song start slashing razor small kind use safety razor slash like scratch nothing deep barely enough make bleed across chest arm look happy almost elated singing spinning around slashing sudden look different naked heavy set around middle body longer hair look older torso open stare terror start vacuuming intestine vacuum hose still smiling ecstasy still spinning around like happy dancing finally finished emptying standing gaping open alive dance across living room sliding door collapse backyard wooden deck woke dream described wizard oz style people guess know movie dreamed people talking woman man beginning dream
297,Weird rat dream,Dreams,"So last night I had a dream that I was in town and went to meet up with my dad and brother to go home with them on the bus. Before I got on the bus I picked up a large and fat (live) rat and shoved it into my mouth. I kept it in my throat throughout the entire journey, all whilst talking to my dad and brother about pretty normal stuff. Then when we got off the bus I choked the rat back up and my dad and brother also choked up rats (which I didn't know they had). The rats fell to the ground and appeared dead but then they sprang back to life and ran away.

300,"Reoccurring Dreams, Childhood, Stressful Driving",Dreams,"Every time I fall asleep in the middle of the day, I have really vivid, realistic dreams with similar themes. Recently, two stood out. The first dream was really stressful and involved me driving a manual bus down the highway without knowing where the brakes were with my friend in the passenger seat. There was a whole storyline with this that included a family member's funeral and my childhood neighborhood. The second dream also involved driving my car and was stressful because I was really confused and foggy, as if I was high or drunk or something. I was driving in my car late at night and realized I didn't know where I was going or why I'd gotten in the car. The car windows began rapidly fogging up and it was stressful as I tried to find the defrost button and pull over. As I did that, I realized I was again in my childhood neighborhood.

302,Jumping long flights of stairs,Dreams,"Recently found out through the grapevine that subreddits exist for very specific dreams that seem to happen to a huge amount of people, so I figured I’d try to find if anybody else has this one in particular. I live in a townhome that’s 2 stories high, and has one particularly long flight of stairs and two shorter ones between the top floor and the front door. My dream usually consists of me rushing to the front door, and I always jump the entire flight of stairs that’s super long in a sort of slow motion jump that feels like floating. On occasion I’ll hear either family members outside calling me to hurry up, or some unknown person calling me from upstairs that I’m running away from. Curious if anybody else has had a similar dream, or one with shared aspects like rushing out of the house or jumping long flights of stairs unharmed? My younger brother has told me that he’s had a similar dream, but it makes a bit of sense since we live in the same house.

303,Dream of Bastet; epiphany,Dreams,"A couple of nights a go I dreamed the following:

Swirling colours felt like I was being given all the knowledge of the universe.

304,Two weird dreams last night,Dreams,"I had two weird dreams last night.

One I don't remember much of the details about, but a portion of a road next to a fast food resturant was bombed and a big hole was made, about 9 feet deep. There were about 12 U.S soldiers in it, along with a man, I don't know what he did but in my dream he apparently committed a crime. In the pit with the men, seperated from them was a vat of boiling lava. The guy was then wrapped into a bag, and the soldiers grabbed shovels and piled the lava onto him.  The lava couldn't melt through the bag but the heat was still melting the guy in the bag. The lava hardened and the soldiers took all the hardened lava off, opened the bag, and he was a giant human pizza slice. A soldier then took a part of the human pizza slice and ate it, and said ""Not bad for a human."" They then proceeded to eat all the cheese off the pizza slice.

&#x200B;

The second and most disturbing one, I was in someones home, a giant metal tower where you couldn't see the ceiling. In the middle of the floor was a kitten, a puppy, and a human baby the size of a newborn pup. The baby was in a cradle, his skin was red and veiny, and his skin was wrinkled. I ducked down and talked to him like an adult would talk to a baby. I then picked up the baby in my lips, and put pressure on his head, he started crying. I started licking him and flailing him around with my lips, and I remember feeling really good about it, like the feeling you get when you have a really bad itch and you scratch it. The guy who owned the tower came in, and frowned at me.

305,Can someone please interpret this dream ?,Dreams,"Long story short I had a dream I went to a job interview it was almost the end of the day and the recruiter was not feeling well and had a headache and said she wouldn’t be able to interview me because she doesn’t feel good and if I could come back tomorrow for the interview I said okay and asked if she lived in close proximity so I can give her a ride home (she was an old lady) she said she lived a few minutes out and that she would greatly appreciate it. 

We get in my car and we are driving. A fire truck hits a building behind me and blows up causing for the hood of my car to catch on fire.

306,I remembered a dream within a dream,Dreams,"This happened last night and it was quite disturbing, it was more like 2 dreams that I know I have dreamt before separately but this time they were both in one dream (one that I remembered after I woke up and one I acknowledged in my sleep).

The first dream was that of an airplane crashing and the first time I experienced it, pieces of the plane landed in my yard but no people or anything bloody were there.

 The second time I just watched from afar as the plane crashed and I only saw smoke coming from behind the other houses on my street.

The second dream is a bit disturbing meaning that I saw my brother in my room with his neck and stomach cut open and me thinking he was dead I put something over him. After some time I went to check and he was breathing and trying to speak? and I called the ambulance but they were making fun of me. 

The same thing I dreamt last night only this time when I was calling the ambulance my mom came over and when she was panicking I told her ""don't worry, he'll be fine just like last time ( or ""ik this happened before"" something along the lines).

307,Lucid Dream...,Dreams,"So, a brief backstory on me. I don't dream much, or if I do, I forget what I dreamed about as soon as I wake up. What's different this time is that this dream is still in my memory. Last night I had a very interesting Lucid Dream that I think I'd like to share. My dream started off with me at school. But the thing is, this school was a combination of my Elementary School, Middle School and High School. I'm not sure if this is relevant, but I'm just going to give as much detail that I can. The school was located where my Elementary School was. The building was my Middle School building and all my classmates were the ones from High School. I've been in college for a few years now, so I thought it was a little weird I could still remember the faces of my High School classmates. Anyways, I'm in class, trying to find a seat, when I looked up, and in the corner of my eye I could see that the sky was black. It was night time and I was at school. I could see the huge open field that the Football team would practice on, at at the very edge was a forest bordering the field. I didn't have to squint to tell that I could see two huge yellowish red eyes watching me from just behind the tree line. I brush it off and sit down behind a classmate, who asked me, ""you saw that too right?"" I told him I did, and we both turned to look back at the eyes in the Forest. They were gone this time. Suddenly we see a massive murder of crows quickly fly in all directions out of the forest, when suddenly this Ten to Twelve foot tall humanoid creature leaps out of the forest. This creature was covered in black fur and had horns like a dear. It was Bipedal and started running at our classroom at a tremendous speed, both me and my classmate start running out of classroom trying to escape, the whole time we were running down the halls, we could hear the screams of our classmates and the crunches of their bones as the thing was starting its dinner. My new found ""friend"" and I eventually make it out of the building and start booking it home. We lost sight of each other but I didn't care. I kept running home. As I'm running up my drive, I could see an old Christmas tree out front that was all chopped up ready for fire wood. The front door was open and I busted in. At first sight I saw my old Golden Retriever Abbey, my Dad setting up a new Christmas Tree, my little sister sitting on the couch with my dog, and my mom talking to my Nan in the Kitchen. The thing is, my Dog Abbey has been dead for some time now, and my Mom and Dad have been divorced for just as long. And my Nan, well, she moved back to England a couple years ago. I started stammering to everyone that I was being chased by something and that it's going to get us. They all asked in unison ""What?"" I told them that I had been dreaming and that something was watching me. The all looked serious, and said, ""you're dreaming..."" I remember thinking, how did they know i was dreaming? They started getting louder and louder, eventually shaking me, telling me that I'm Dreaming, and to wake up. That's when I shot out of bed in a cold sweat. I'm not sure what this dream means, or what that thing was that was chasing me, but I was hoping if i posted it here, someone could tell me, or might at least have some clue as to what might be going on? Any feed back is much appreciated.

308,My Weird Day Dreaming,Dreams,"Okay so in school I sleep during my 20-minute study hall to make up for the lack of sleep I get from doing my homework the night before. In my study hall I'm not completely dozed off but I'm in and out of consciousness randomly going from checking my phone to see what time it is, and going back into a daydream if that's what you'd call it. My daydreams are less detailed than my regular dreams I'm guessing because I'm just not in deep sleep. So in my daydreams I'll do an action like throw a ball or jump and then I'll violently wake up doing the motion of that action (like a wake up swinging my arm for a throw or jumping in my seat.)  It's become a class joke now because when this happens it's noticeable and the class tries to guess what I was dreaming about from my actions. Why does my body mimic what happens in my dreams? why do I instantly jerk awake from doing these actions? and is this a problem? like an early onset of sleepwalking?

 It’s so dark. Dark, quiet, and cold. I’ve been walking now for what feels like days, weeks or months even. But as I crest the top of a hill I finally reach what has been calling to me all this time. Nestled in a valley surrounded by towering mountains lies the source of my fascination. A spider, monstrous in size and of an age beyond what I can fathom with my mortal mind. As I approach it its eyes open and within them, I see the trueness that is this entity before me. I see the breadth of its form. As if the spider is allowing me to witness its full shape so I might know it. The largest mountain at the end of the valley is no mountain at all but rather its calcified abdomen jutting up into the air as a testament to its might.  


  
I see eight massive legs drawn out flat against the ground, calcified from remaining still for so many centuries… Yet no plants grow upon the dirt settled on them. At the end of each leg is a massive chain bolted through the leg and traveling deep within the earth. Chains weaved not from metal, but something stronger and far older. The silk of the spider before me, the same silk used to weave the fabric of the universe, now binds this ancient creature to our world. But there is something more to the chains, something that calls to me as I find myself lost in the eyes of this entity.  


  
Engraved upon each and every link woven into the chains is a name. A full name belonging to a certain mortal who lives at the same time I do. They travel around their cities and nations in blissful ignorance, not knowing that their soul is potentially bound to the freedom of the entity before me. A voice, not quite real and not quite imagined but calm and slow, begins to speak to me as I stand there. It tells me of the ritual. The ritual that breaks the link of the chain. To bring the mortal named on the link before the spider, then make a masterpiece from the flesh and present it as an offering. With their consumption by the spider the link is made to be weak, and when every link in the chain is weakened… The spider is freed.  


  
As the waking world calls to me I feel my consciousness returning from the depths of the spider’s eyes until… I am me again… It was only a dream. But the first of many. This honestly perplexes me, and yes I wrote this like a story. As I said, it’s ongoing. I’ve had other similar dreams I might detail to you if more details are revealed.

317,Patton Oswalt suffocating,Dreams,"I usually don’t dream. I suffer from depression and smoking weed makes me forget all my dreams, if I had them at all. Recently, I’ve decided to cutback and try to be sober. As a side effect, I now have vivid dreams about weird stuff. I’m posting it for your enjoyment. (Upvoted will tell me if this is enjoyable).


Imagine a parking garage; two stories, concrete and nearly empty in the early morning. The sun rises and the morning dew drips off a nearby pine tree.

A large black Cadillac pulls up by the elevator on the 2nd floor. It stops, and I step out. I’m tall, 6’2” with messy brown hair and a gut. I’m wearing jeans and a pinstripe dress shirt. I walk over to the newsstand; one of those little metal boxes that has the day’s newspaper.

A pastel blue VW bug parks next to me, and Patton steps out in a pink shirt with tan chinos. He starts gasping and holding his chest. He slowly stumbles toward me, one hand holding his chest, the other grasping for me as I lunge to catch him.

He falls to the ground. He’s twitching. I pull out the newspaper which has transformed into an oxygen mask. It’s not a medical mask; it looks like the kind from Avatar with the clear face mask. I put it on him and hear the hissing noise. His eyes open, wide and bright, and he sees me.

318,Really bad dream,Dreams,"

I was in the middle of a lake with dave. Dave is my moms friend whos super supportive and nice. In the dream he had a way nicer home that somewhat floated on the lake. Then there were racoons. As we were heading somewhere (there was a landbridge that connected the home with the island the house was on) several racoons junped on me. They started nawing and biting me. I feel everything as if its fucking real! The fear the pain the muscles and teeth! And he dosent do anything but tell me its nothing! 

A while later and i find some kids i dont know in that house with their mom. It looks like something straight out of im sorry john. Something terrible is attached to the back of her head and its even bigger outside the house. She starts yelling at them in an inhuman voice. Its totally unnatural in every sense and just cuts through everything! Suddenly she presses something and we get an xray view of the kids. Theres small things in their bodies activating. Little chainsaws ripping and tearing inside them and suddenly i see one of the brother lose his balls! Do you know what sound a kid makes when he loses his balls to a fucking chainsaw!?!?!?! And i woke up not only scared and panicked but depressed and sad and making sure i didn't lose anything and no one is going to fucking what im going through!

Im losing my mind irl. My depression has skyrocketed, my thoughts of self harm have increased tenfold and my nightmares have gotten so vivid I'm waking up traumatized, depressed or worse. Everytime i go to a supportive subreddit looking for help or to vent you know what happens? I get hate or ignored or lost. Whats an even bigger kick in the dingus is that someone posts something super similar and guess what happens? You all flock to his side and tell me to fuck off or im a liar or whatever!

I didn’t feel like I had a physical body but just a consciousness, a feeling of just ‘being’. The endless crowd of people were facing the same direction and I had the distinct feeling that we were waiting for something in anticipation. Instead of fear, I felt unbelievable content peace, comfort, and love. We were watching something that I could only be described as looking like an imax screen showing moving images. It had no sound. The image was of doctors in green scrubs and white masks walking back and forth. 
Suddenly, quicker than a blink, I was in the room with the doctors. It was unbearably bright, freezing cold, loud, and I was pissed. Then I woke up. As I laid there in bed I was very upset and angry that I woke up and tried to go back to sleep and have the dream again. To be in that loving expanse of darkness...

324,The Power of Karmic Good,Dreams,"I have been sleeping non-stop today because I wanted to keep dreaming and I have been. So in my dream the world is struck by a plague and during the current status of my dream 1/3 of the population has been killed and turned into zombies. It isn’t as heavy in America but just enough for society to have been overturned. So there is a military but since power and internet are down they can’t broadcast their rules so the military (who absorbed the police authority) have been wandering around “keeping the peace” but they’re just a high powered bully group. The world has sorta gone back to hunter-gather based groups which we in the dream called clans. And these class range from 5 people to like 100 people. But usually after that size they break into multiple or 2 different clans because when youre roaming around you can only find so much food so the bigger the group the less you eat. So I am in a clan of like 10 people. Its literally like nation-state Greece or like a video game or anything where there are bunch of small countries fighting/working together. People with groups less than 5 are pretty fucked because killing zombies is hard to organize and if you don’t have enough people to cover every direction along with someone calling the shots then youre just dead. In the dream my clan and another friendly clan are raiding this mall together. We are doing well but get driven out by zombies out the back entrance of the mall. We hadn’t gone to the back of the mall before. Since we were city clans we had a lot more organization and less brutality but towards the back of the mall was like where a more “hood” place was located and we realize in this backwoods hood place its actually safer. They have more places to run and more people that are friendly vs the city people were rude and possessive. So we start staying in the backwoods sorta trailer-park like area connected to forest. And every night there is a bonfire party, orgy, zombie killing, food sharing feast. They hold the bonfire party because it attracts all the zombies to that area. The people at the party do all the zombie killing but no one would want to go to it if it was no fun. So they give out like drugs, food, and weapons if you dont have any - there are people having orgies too there. So if you get tired of killing or eating or dancing to the music blaring on speakers connected to generators you can go closer to the fire and join an orgy. It was crazy. The mix of hard work and immediate sensual pleasures is what drove the culture of the backwoods. So people in the forrest areas were super happy and well fed, so thats why my clan stayed there. But then there was this rumor that a rival backwoods clan wanted our area. So the backwoods is run by like a governing body that controls territory and any clan can come and join the backwoods as long as they abide by territory rules and like “pay their taxes” which is were if you get a kill or collect a lot of food (animals/berries/whatever) or get good loot (find some tech or a neat useful item like a hammer or something) you give it to the government (which they document how much you give) and during the bonfire they distributed food and loot. So lets say you find/make like 5 cool weapons they might distribute those back to you for being cooperative or they might give you back 3 and take 2 as tax. If you kill a deer and give it to the backwoods - they dont give the food back but they make sure you eat, everyone eats, everynight. So like as time goes on you become sorta dependent because if you leave, you leave with like zero food since you give them all your food in exchange for safety and food everyday for you to eat so thats like the trade off - they remove the unpredictability of the zombie apocalypse by providing the general safety within the community. But this other government wanted their territory and they have this research chemical. At first we thought we were being pushed back by just mutant animals that got the zombie germs but it affected them differently but then we realized that the chemical allowed people of the Banglore (the backwoods community trying to take territory from us) take the drug and transform into these big apes (depending on your size as a human) and go in and kill our people and push us back. As we fight back tho we end up getting some of the chemical and then remaking it (this takes some weeks actually but for the sake of brevity I’ll skip the warring phases) to turn our people into warriors too. But our chemical is WAY stronger we like refined their purity and made it stronger. But this made some people turn into like GIANT animals like the size of an apartment building big. And the drug ended up destroying the government of the backwoods because people that had good reactions to the drug seemed more powerful than those that didn’t and since they had more power they were more important and people stopped listening to the backwoods and started listening to them because 1) they needed these people with good reactions to fight and protect everyone and 2) they couldn’t stop them if they tried they could just pop a pill and transform?!? They were too strong. So the governments dissolved back into tribes lead by these, so called, super-mutants. After the rise of the super mutants in the backwoods the civil unrest allowed for Banglore to make some headway. Also in conjunction with some of these super-mutants defecting to Banglore, it made fighting them nearly impossible. The government is falling apart they need more warriors that they don’t have and they can’t keep the people happy anymore so they’re basically done. So my clan is on the way out and it’s the day before this planned uprising/raid of the backwoods government before people skedaddle on out. So I go to this house party and there are people there just having fun because they want to relish the days of the backwood while its still happening and its literally like a cesspool of decadence and debauchery. Alcohol, weed, meth and any drug you want you just go to the counter and you get it - unlimitedly. The party has been going on for like 3 days now. Pretty much every girl in there is naked or with minimal clothes on and are  frivolously  fucking to the point where guys aren’t asking, they are just going up and fucking whoever they want whenever they want and the girls are high on the atmosphere and the drugs and the music and just the social aspect of it all they just take it and enjoy it because it’s the “right thing to do”. The music blaring. And like during all of this I’m filming - before the zombies I had like backed up a large part of the useful internet and still had a bunch of technologies that I remade to create like my own set of tools to access and store data. So im partly documenting everything thats happening and also using the data I have to be useful when I can without letting people know I have access to like - wikipedia or google maps and stuff. I have a video camera I go around and record stuff with also so at first this party was cool but as I was there for an hour recording the party the orgy the drugs and everything I was like fuck - this place is evil as shit this aint right the sensual pleasures are too much. So I leave and I see this house. This was the house of a guy that everyone in the backwoods hated because instead of taking part in the bonfire rituals and the culture of the backwoods he paid his taxes and he built a house out of his own hard work and just stayed to himself. It was like a big wooden cabin it was a nice house. So people felt like some type of way that he got a special house while they got community huts but he worked hard to make it on his own so the government never took it away. But this dude has knowledge and is to himself so I go over just because ik today is the last day of the backwoods realistically and I knock on his door. And he opens and immediately lets me come in. I talk with him and he tells me he knows about me from the friendly clan I worked with to raid the mall and he’s been watching me to see my character and because I am not a bad person like the people of the backwoods he would tell me a secret to winning the war and stopping the zombies. He says that he is going to die tho because the people of the house know he has the power. The leader of the house came over yesterday to make him submit and when he refused he asked for a duel outside (ape vs ape) but the the leader was a super-mutant and knew he could easily kill the man. Then when the duel started the house leader goes super the cabin guy wasn’t expecting that so he runs away and the dude squashes him like a bug. BUT right before he gets squashed  he takes his drug he’s been manufacturing. And he doesn’t die and he takes the skull of a bull and holds it and becomes a GIANT mammoth. Then he destroys the guy with his tusk. He tells me that it wasn’t the drug that was making people transform but the spirit of humanity and the power to harness energy of other things. So people party and do the backwoods shit because it gives them more power when they transform. But when you are a good person you learn to draw power from a more pure place and that gives you the ability to manifest your body and turn it into anything, not just a strong big ape. Since he didn’t have a lot of good energy he held the dead skull to bless the spirit of the animal in the afterlife and when he did the animal in return gave him good karmic energy he used to transform. Then he put his hands on my skull and I could fell the power he was talking about to transform. Oh its relevant to say that I tried taking the mutant drug to transform before but it didnt work. So then I knew why it didn’t now. It was because I didn’t have the karmic evil energy of the backwoods people to harness it into that kind of monster. But now I knew how to turn good energy into power and he said run they are coming. I ask for him to come with me and it was like a sad movie and he said he was a very very evil person and it took him a long time to learn to become good. But his karmic evil was way to high for him to overcome anymore and he had no future because of it. He had learned his nature and accepted his evil and rejected/repented for what he had done. This self-knowledge and repentance disallowed him for being able to transform using karmic evil but also he had so much karmic evil his karmic good energy was over powered. The formula is: karmic good - karmic evil = power output. Since his good was so low his evil never let it show. And since he repented he couldn’t use the power of evil anymore. I can hear the people from the party I left coming. And he says good bye and tells me to leave. And I transform into this (regular sized so they wouldnt notice as much) beautiful white and blond/golden ape and look back at him one last time and then run to my clan to tell them what happened. The crazy thing was that my whole dream is like in 3rd person but when I run away I (the me dreaming) realize that I am looking at myself from the perspective of the man that built the cabin and that told me about the power and they were coming to kill me and I had accepted my fate and as they break into my house - I peacefully wake up from sleep.",0,power karmic good sleeping non stop today

325,weird prophecies and graphic nightmares,Dreams,"for context i haven't experienced anything hugely traumatic, i'm on my first year after foundation at uni and have had some minor stresses, i took some time figuring out what i wanted to do with myself so its a bit of pressure.. Mostly i've been trying to please my flatmates which seems to reflect in my dreams, theres been a few ocassions (i was somewhat stoned which might affect things) like when i dreamt about being told to quiet down in a lengthy message when i woke up this exact thing happened, i also had a premonition when i was told to pick up a pint of milk or clean up someones mess in the kitchen.

This was weird enough but recently these dreams have taken surreal turns, last night it gradually shifted from the extremely mundane psychic predictions of daily activities to intensely graphic imagery, I was just at the shops, then suddenly i was transported to the killing fields in Cambodia, being subjected to an endless montage of kids getting dismembered.

326,Dream about an ex,Dreams,"I just woke up from one of the most memorable if not only memorable dream in months. It started off with me and some girl flirting at a motel. I had never met her and things seemed okay. 
That’s when I realized my only/first ex (only real relationship) was there too. I was shy and weirded out as I wasn’t really sure it was a dream. My ex is now married irl happily and I’m glad for her, was a while ago and have come to understand that that’s life. In the dream she appeared as a better person than the girl I was originally talking to in the dream. Anyways, a couple of event happened that didn’t relate to this story. A could was outside, and their baby seemed to be either injured or was crying as if it was really upset. Then, the mother DROPS the baby and the baby gets a bloody nose, but it seemed as if she did it on purpose and I am 99% sure it had died. Little research told me I am holding onto the past.
In the same area, I see a recognizable face but unsure of who it is. A man comes from behind him and stabs/kills him. I run and forget about this in the dream though, and continue with my ex. I don’t remember much about this but I think we were reconnecting in an emotional way but she was hesitant at parts and not attached. In the last part of my dream, right before my ex and I were gonna talk away from the other people, the same man from before comes from behind her and stabs me right as I wake up. Never been as disturbed and confused as when I woke up 10 minutes ago

327,My dream about a strawberry milkshake,Dreams,"  I've researched the different items in this dream and can't seem to come to a conclusion, so I thought you guys could help!

  In the dream, I was alone in my kitchen, in a robe, making a homemade strawberry milkshake. First I poured the milk into the blender, then plopped in a few scoops of ice cream, sprayed a great deal of whipped cream, and carefully dropped in some strawberries. 
 
 RIGHT before I pressed the button to blend, I was suddenly transported to a 50s style diner. I was wearing a pink dress and my hair was up in standard 50s/60s fashion (I never wear pink, and I never do my hair). In front of me was a perfectly put-together strawberry milkshake, down to the artful dollop of whipped cream and cherry on top. Sitting across from me was an older man in a grey suit jacket. Nothing else was discernable about him, but I was inexplicably happy. 
  Any ideas, guys?

328,Anyone have this problem? Or have tips on how to fix it?,Dreams,"I’ve suffered from terrible nightmares for years now... but now days I get them nearly every night, and I remember them always. I barely get any sleep because of it, and they’re often times so vivid that I begin to get reality mixed up with my dreams (ex. Having something happen in a dream that I swore happened irl, etc.) 

I haven’t slept well in a very long time, and I basically gave up on trying to fix myself because I really don’t know what the hell is wrong. I have anxiety and depression issues, and OCD, but there’s tons of people who have these same issues and don’t get terrible dreams. I’ve googled it many times and a lot of the sites say very bad dreams are often associated with PTSD and stuff like that, but I don’t have suffer from conditions such as those. 

I’ve tried a lot of things. establishing a good bed time routine, melatonin (doesn’t work for me), valerian root pills (also doesn’t work for me), trying not to watch scary movies, making my bedroom a comfortable place, not eating before bed, taking vitamins and supplements that I may be lacking, etc etc. Yet nearly every night the nightmares come. I wake up stiff and tired nearly everyday and it makes me more depressed in turn. I never get proper rest, and noticed my eye bags are getting worse. 

Anyone else suffer with this? Could it perhaps just be some sort of chronic nightmare disorder? I know many people who say they don’t dream at all, I really really wish I could be like that. This is becoming too much to handle. Like I said I already gave up on trying to cure it since I don’t know what else to do, but figured I’d try here as a last attempt. 

I don’t really want to mention what the dreams contain, since they’re quite disturbing and I try not to think about them.

For context, let me tell you I'm a girl, I'm in high school, and I live very close to my high school but I usually take the bus. Anyways, it was the end of the school day so I went on my bus. Like usual, it was crowded and noisy, so I sat next to the guy I described earlier. I said hi but nothing else after that. I started humming a song, ""Seventeen"" from Heathers. That's when I heard him singing along softly. I felt a little embarrassed but I feel like there was a connection even though I only said one word to him. That's when the bus pulled into a neighborhood called ""Marina"". Thinking about it now, the sign was the same color as his hoodie, but just a little faded and rusted. I got up to leave when they pulled at the first stop. He looked at me. ""Is that it?"" He asked with a playful smile. I was a bit surprised at this. ""I guess so?"" I replied and left to walk to my house. The only other thing from the dream I remember is telling my friends about the guy.

333,I've seen an anime about a snail girl in my dream.,Dreams,"It was one of those weird dreams I have after some involuntary sleep deprivation. Last night I couldn't fall asleep till 6 a. m.

I had a dream that I was back to school. I was sat in front of a desk and my copybook was used as a sketchbook, which attracted my classmates\` attention. Among some furry sketches I drew that snail girl, which I was sure was from an anime. Overall, she was just like any regular girl, except she was a bit short and had a little spiral purple rucksack made of calcium carbonate on her back — the shell.

Meanwhile, the dream changed the decorations and I assumed the role of, again, an average (Japanese?) schoolboy in the anime about the snail girl. So, I met a (fictional) friend of mine. I asked her about that weird girl by that house over there, and she told me that snail story. ""She looks quite human"",— I said jokingly. ""No human would ever subscribe to \[???\]"",— my friend replied. And the snail girl turned around, revealing her snail traits. The snail girl, apparently, lived in a house with a human schoolgirl, who was trying to teach something her clumsy cohabitant at the moment. ""So, is she, like, her girlfriend"",— I expressed my curiosity. ""Yes, but some might think she's her stepdaughter. You have to look after her like after a little child."", the reply followed.

The snail girl had short purple hair, occasionally covering her eyes, and was wearing a hoodie or one of those Japanese anime jumpsuit pajamas. Also, she would sometimes hide in her shell when afraid or embarrassed, despite of the small size of the shell, which obviously couldn't fit her. Although, I think this is just an animation metaphor.

Following this scene I walked down the street to the sea in bemusement. I met some serious scientifically literate folks there, with whom I was somehow familiar, and told the story about what I have witnessed. They told me about giant snails with extraordinarily high mimicry skills.

Soon I started to gradually awaken and realise that that perfect anime never existed.",0,seen anime snail girl dream one weird dream involuntary sleep deprivation last night fall asleep till dream back school sat front desk copybook used sketchbook attracted classmate attention among furry sketch drew snail girl sure anime overall like regular girl except bit short little spiral purple rucksack made calcium carbonate back shell meanwhile dream changed decoration assumed role average japanese schoolboy anime snail girl met fictional friend mine asked weird girl house told snail story look quite human said jokingly human would ever subscribe friend replied snail girl turned around revealing snail trait snail girl apparently lived house human schoolgirl trying teach something clumsy cohabitant moment like girlfriend expressed curiosity yes might think stepdaughter look like little child reply followed snail girl short purple hair occasionally covering eye wearing hoodie one japanese anime jumpsuit pajama also would sometimes hide shell afraid embarrassed despite small size shell obviously fit although think animation metaphor following scene walked street sea bemusement met serious scientifically literate folk somehow familiar told story witnessed told giant snail extraordinarily high mimicry skill soon started gradually awaken realise perfect anime never existed

335,My good friend Shakira has detachable breasts and genitals,Dreams,"I had a dream I was visiting the musician Shakira in her house on the north side of town.  In the dream, she was a good friend of mine.  She had her breasts in one blue and white cardboard box on the coffee table, and the front half of her pelvis in another,  She was doing something in another part of the house, and I snuck a look in the breast box.  They were smallish, probably b cups, with small dark brown puffy nipples.  I licked and nibbled on one, thinking to myself it was funny that I could now say I had sucked on Shakira's titty, even though I knew it didn't count because she wasn't wearing them (and it was perfectly normal in the dream that people had detachable parts).  She yelled from the other room ""Hey, I can feel that!"" and so I stopped and put it back in the box.

She came back in the room and I asked her if I could borrow them for a little while, and she says sure, she's not using them right now, and used some euphemism for being on her period that I had never heard and can't remember now.

I got in my car (I don't have a car) and started driving down the road with the two boxes on the passenger seat, and I was thinking I'd post pictures of them on Reddit so I could prove that I knew Shakira IRL.  I then remembered that Shakira lives in South America, not in my city, and realized I must be dreaming.  I saw that none of the highway signs made sense so I made myself wake up.

336,The Pew Pew machines make me nervous,Dreams,"I would like it if someone could help interpret this dream  
PS, I'm 26, Male, 3rd yr physics student, have 2 children age 5 and 2.

I'll get straight to it: (Also posted in a smaller group)

I was walking my 5yr old son to his classroom at school, and they had a new turret gun system installed to combat against school shootings. It would get hidden in the ceiling but you knew where they were as they would make a bug zapper kind of buzzing noise.It was supposed to detect anyone who was about to fire a gun and execute them before anyone got hurt.Before school it would only have rubber bullets because it was considered that even someone with a gun outside of school hours wouldn't be a threat. At the start of the school day it would load with live rounds and they would make an announcement with the bell that it is ""switching to live rounds"".

My son was playing and running around,being a normal happy kid, but I had to ponder what could possibly set the system off. I decided to try and explain to my son what ""live rounds"" were, and that if they went off they would kill him in an instant. I found it too hard to explain and decided to drop it.

The kids were all too young to understand what any of it meant, and were blissfully unaware.As I was walking through the school I would watch kids throw things like stones and I would get really nervous. It felt like there was a gun pointing at my (and everyone else's) head everywhere I went, triggered by a program written by someone who only had hypothetical scenarios they could imagine to guide how it operated.

After a while it freaked me out so I went into my son's class to speak with the teacher, and figure out who to talk about to get rid of the thing. Before meeting the teacher I saw a fat naked lady sitting just inside the door with all the kids seated on the floor for the teacher who was also naked but just going about the day like normal. I gathered it was some planned activity to ""teach the kids to be proud and confident of their bodies no matter what they looked like"".

Despite my desire to question how appropriate this was, I decided not to address it.To not put the teacher on the spot I asked ""hey do you who I can talk to about the **pew pew,** it's really freaking me out.

Teacher: ""Why would it be freaking you out"".

Me: ""Um, you know what, I don't really have a reason but I'm really uncomfortable about it and its freaking me out"".

The teacher says to everyone that I can just go into the staff toilet till I feel better, to imply that was the correct solution if you get irrationally anxious.

I took that as a signal that it wasn't to be questioned, and by me saying anything at all, I've made the kids aware that there is something to be nervous about, which seems to have upset the teacher.

I go to the toilet to sit for a little while, and decide not to waste my time, walk back out and say ""I'm feeling better, thankyou for your suggestion""

I go into the office on the way out of the school and try asking the receptionist about the system and they start defending it heavily like they are already prepared to fight off concerned parents.

I ask if there is any kind of specification on how it works, details, even a standard (I ask for standards a lot in dreams).They said it was impossible to have a standard because its the first of its kind, and its the best there is.

They then say there was a committee that met 18 times over 12months to make sure there were no issues with the system, and it can't go wrong.I wasn't satisfied with that answer as it felt like it was more of a fudge figure and not representative of any actual work done to prevent accidents or false detection.

All I could think about was some innocent naive kid was going to be shot dead, and the grieving family it would leave behind. Then if this were the case, it will just become some ""lessons learned"" document for the developers, and that even this won't get it removed from the school.

341,When Life Gives You Lemons,Dreams,"Had a super lucid dream last night. I don't get them as often any more and if I do dream, it's usually a recurring experience (like walking through a hallway but never opening the door).

I was in a strange version of life. A setting that bordered on my current environment and fantasy, like large, open ramparts set on a hilly cliffside overlooking the ocean. A high school acquaintance was playing different scores of Chopin on some strange device that looked like a rollodex of 20 different Edison cylinder records but sounded like a harpsichord. Then a close friend bet me he could swim across the ocean, jumped off the rampart and disappeared. Lots of just strange and random occurrences.

After three or four random events, I was led into a small wooden room that resembled a saloon  to meet a man who looked like The Dude. Everything seemed great. He introduced himself as God, mumbled something under his breath, then stabbed me in the eyes a few times and began throwing things at me. After getting hit four or five times, I realized they were lemons. I was a bit confused. 

Then the dream reset, with me walking into the room to meet God for the first time - serious deja Vu. This time, I expected the stabbing and the lemons. On the second hit, I picked it up and threw it back at him. I saw the beginnings of a smile on his face and then--BAM! I woke up.",0,life give lemon super lucid dream last night get often dream usually recurring experience like walking hallway never opening door strange version life setting bordered current environment fantasy like large open rampart set hilly cliffside overlooking ocean high school acquaintance playing different score chopin strange device looked like rollodex different edison cylinder record sounded like harpsichord close friend bet could swim across ocean jumped rampart disappeared lot strange random occurrence three four random event led small wooden room resembled saloon meet man looked like dude everything seemed great introduced god mumbled something breath stabbed eye time began throwing thing getting hit four five time realized lemon bit confused dream reset walking room meet god first time serious deja vu time expected stabbing lemon second hit picked threw back saw beginning smile face bam woke

344,"Just had a very different dream, wondering what it means?",Dreams,"For the last 2 weeks my sleep tracker app has shown that I haven't been having a lot of rem sleep, some nights none at all, I haven't had a long, particularly vivid dream for quite a while, until last night. I wrote down what I could remember but there's a few gaps...

It was daytime, in a very big house with lots of people, there were lots of doors in this house leading to big rooms, I was standing in the lobby kind of area, the people all seemed friendly and were largely recognisable, but not accurate of my close friends or family. Suddenly some of the doors burst open and 7 other people come running out into the lobby, they were zombies and myself  and all the people in the lobby knew that, but they didn't look or act like zombies, they didn't attack straight away but I suddenly had a revolver (with 7 bullets in it) and a stubby shotgun with 2 shells. There was a bit of a standoff, the zombies and the normal people taking slow steps toward eachother and stopping for a few seconds, kinda like dogs do. We were then face to face, I started firing and bullseyed every single one, not a single bullet wasted, which is strange because I usually struggle to defend myself in dreams. Whilst I'm firing I'm second guessing myself whether I've just shot normal people, they were acting strange but not like normal zombies...we move to another bigger room and bolt all the doors, there is a large chunk of the dream missing here, but I know something important happened and I'll add it if it comes back, fast forward towards the end of the dream, people are trying to get in the room for safe haven from the zombies, but I don't trust that they aren't zombies themselves, so I don't let them in, I notice their skin colour and they happen to be black, and I thought to myself ""damn, I hope they don't think I didn't let them in cos they're black"". That's all I remember but I'll add if anything comes back. Really wondering if there's much to take from this dream? Please feel free to ask me any questions, I'm very open about my life.

I'm staring at it and for what ever reason I whip out my knife to see what's the later beneath looks like. I'm stopped by a sergeant who says I can ""get fucking fined for fucking with the plants here"" so I put the knife away. Boss man starts talking to us about whatever it is First sergeants think is worth talking about when suddenly from a building behind him. Dogs. So many puppers start pouring out of all kinds. Were all dead silent completely confused but obviously excited, but no one approaches the pups. Soon some of them start to approach us. Doing what dogs do washing tails giving kisses. Everybody hype. But then something weird happens. What pup (idk the breed but the kind that are all brown with medium long shiney fur) starts to talk. He yells out ""Andy! I love you Andy! I love you already Andy!"" All while looking at my buddy whose name definitely isnt Andy. So that's weird but hey dogs. Were all feeling good again until suddenly from the same building. Children? A whole bunch of kids start marching out. Kids of all races and shapes. But before we can even start to figure things out, the nightmare begins. Up until now the kids coming out are all wearing normal clothes. But out of  nowhere this group of children opens up to reveal a whole bundle of kids wearing navy blue shorts and the most hazardous yellow collars shirts (mikado according to google) and these kids are making a B-line right for us. Everyone's paralyzed dude. I manage to speak first but it's nothing meaningful. The words ""what the fuck"" kinda fumble out of my mouth. This was a mistake. One of the little girls looks at me, opens her mouth and starts to scream. Head splinting. If you've ever played Dead space 2 it sounds just like The Pack (the child enemy of the game). Every ones is covering their ears and cringing but we aren't given much time to recover as the kids are sprinting towards us now. We act accordingly and start running for our lives. I quickly scurry up that tree from before, hoping that the kids will be too short to climb up and for a second it looks like I'm correct. I can see the river of piss yellow children sprinting past my tree. There are just a few at the base looking up at me wonder how they can get up to me. Well theh quickly figure out how. They begin the mount each other. It doesnt take much to reach the lower branches and suddenly their climbing after me up through the branches. And that's it. I'm up.

350,I'd almost forgotten about this dream...,Dreams,"Not sure if this calls for a nsfw tag as it's not really explicit...?

Context: I had this dream (apparently) on June 12th, 2018. The morning after I had it I wrote it down and emailed it to myself. I found it again while cleaning out my inbox today. I've edited a few typos/grammar mistakes and replaced the names of the people involved with generic descriptors, but other than that, this is what I had originally written, verbatim.

""I am here now to relate to you a most strange dream. It was equal parts disturbing and incredible.

First, it is important to note that you were attending an event. The nature of this event was unspecified. I do know, however, that it was exceedingly large. A far greater scale than any convention you had attended previously. It was not only large, but also distant. The journey took two days. You travelled with your mother and siblings. Your father and perhaps a few of the youngest children were absent. The reason was not explained.

On the second night of your journey, you stayed, of all places, at a gas station. The building possessed two miniature beds which somehow slept six people comfortably. It was understood that your family had access to the building whenever they may need it.

The decor was decidedly adult (possible foreshadowing of events to come). You had half a mind to remove a few of the posters, but as the building was public and not under your jurisdiction, you decided against it.

The event spanned multiple days. You slept with the family at a nearby place. It cannot quite be described as a house or a building. It was too strange for words. I cannot adequately relate the shape and nature of the place. I do remember you had a clear view of your surroundings. Presumably through a window, though it may well have been empty space. Across from your sleepspace, there was a massive, yet unfinished mansion. You will visit this place later.

When not attending the event, you were often using headphones, cell phones, laptops, and television. However the content you had access to was restricted and your father-who appeared without explanation- could remove devices from your possession at any time.

The event took place in a labyrinth of rooms, stairwells, hallways, spaces accessible only by shaky ladders or fragile ropes. It was not particularly crowded besides your core group of acquaintances- though they would soon become much more than that.

Many rooms were large and filled with bookshelves placed seemingly at random, and some shelves filled with snacks and junk food. The lighting throughout the interior of the building was dim, though not dark. You and your friends frolicked. A word which is meant to mean chased each other about, laughing for not particular reason and running, jumping, with no particular end. The people who accompanied you included (at some time or another) , Guy Friend, The Twins, and various students who attended school with you. The fact that both twins were present will soon appear disturbing and unusual. As will the presence of Guy Friend.

As you were debating which activity to participate in next, Cole provided an interesting suggestion to which all present happily agreed. You found his suggestion socially unacceptable but alluring nonetheless. His suggestion was this: why don’t we celebrate our four year anniversary? The others seemed immediately to recall what he was referring to. It seemed you were missing some information, intruding on an inside joke. Anniversary of what? You were obviously involved, but for some reason the others were unsurprised to hear that you had no memory of the event.

Four years was inaccurate, but precise numbers are unimportant in the dreamscape. You distinctly remembered attending the same event last year and frolicking in much the same manner. Perhaps you had become high or drunk, causing you to forget the details. But you’d never been high, nor drunk! Was is possible to become so intoxicated and not remember? You concluded that perhaps it was just routine forgetfulness, or a result of a natural, manic high. Such occurrences were not foreign to you. Even so, it seemed strange, almost impossible, to completely forget an event of such magnitude.

The event in question was illicit sexual behavior between the very individuals now present, with one exception of which you would learn later. Guy Friend created a group chat including the members, titled 4 Year Orgy Anniversary! There were seven participants total. You, Guy Friend, Twin One, Twin Two, Gal Friend, Gal Acquaintance, and one who you did not recall meeting.

Six of you met in a secluded room containing books and snacks. Thin, yellow shafts of light criss-crossed the floor and ceiling-which was very high. Once arrived, you noticed the unfamiliar face.

“Wait, wait,” you said, alarmed that you could forget meeting someone. “Who’s this?”

The girl had medium light hair. She was not much taller than you. The specifics of her build and face escape me, but she was not particularly attractive. Her name was Ionian, or something equally alien.

Eyes wide, you asked each member individually what you had done with her. They each responded with the same word, a single word, “torso”. You assumed they meant you’d engaged somehow with her breasts. Ah. Okay.

The chosen method of celebration was, of course, to repeat the experience. The merrymaking commenced with tender kisses, seemingly at random. Your lips collided with Gal Acquaintence’s. She certainly knew what she was doing. You could feel someone’s hot breath on your neck.

The event had barely started when it was abruptly ended with a rude interruption. A door swung open, letting in a flood of light. Immediately you spun on your heel and marched towards the snacks, instinctively speaking loudly so as to seem unsuspicious. The others stood awkwardly, embarrassed at being walked in on. The intruder was a woman with glasses.You stood on a ladder and began pulling candy bars from a shelf. “KitKats? Do you guys want KitKats?” I tossed the candy to my friends at random. There were only three KitKats.

The woman eventually left. We collectively breathed a sigh of relief. I was praised for acting so casually. The celebration did not recommence.

The following day was filled with introspection and confusion. The fact that each of the other participants had matching memories pointed towards the conclusion that the original event had indeed occurred. But how? And if I was intoxicated somehow, had I been raped? How could I not remember this? I deleted the group chat. I watched television as I pondered with a pout on my lips and eyebrows drawn together.

Conclusion came when I awoke and realized that nothing of the kind had occurred.""

Yeah so.........that's it. I remember feeling really strange about the dream, uncomfortable, concerned about if it meant anything. Like, why would I dream something like that?? I do tend to forget important things that happened to me in real life. And as disturbing as it was it was also really vivid and the scenery & landscapes were pretty, in a weird, trippy way. Honestly it's kind of funny to me looking back but I still feel sort of icky about it.

351,I was in a theater where the seats were lowered down into the dirt ground,Dreams,"Really strange dream... it started with me seated at a large theater. Not a movie theater, but an actual live theater where you might see Broadway performances like the Gershwin Theatre in Manhattan after paying several hundreds of dollars for a ticket. This was that kind of theater.

At one point during the show, for some reason, the audience's seats (including mine) were slowly lowered several feet into the dirt ground below. The floor had completely disappeared by this point, and all that was left under us was loose soil, nothing like what you would expect to find in a large city where such a theater might be located.

Also, the seats we were in seemed to have the ability to swing back and forth through the air; they were no longer fixed to the ground, and it's like they were hanging from the ceiling. I could control this, and so I decided to swing back and forth on the seat as far as I could. Even in my dream, I realized this was odd, so I started taking pictures with my camera. I wanted to swing as far as I could and take a picture to remember this bizarre moment.

Unfortunately, I swung too far, and caused the string or whatever holding my seat to break. I also happened to be sharing a seat with another guy (I was on a chair all by myself just a while before, so this is weird). He seemed annoyed at me for causing him to crash to the ground, but didn't appear to be injured. I somehow knew this complete stranger's name to be Andy, and I apologized to him.

Just woke up from a a nightmare. I was working in a hospital and someone was planting bombs in the city. They had found a bunch and defused them and then brought them to our hospital to be examined, but something went wrong and they went off. I had to evacuate patients and families and no one wanted to go. Eventually everyone started moving and I had to get a room full of immobile patients to the elevators and the people visiting them were like, NO help and I had to do it all myself. We had them lined up in beds in the hall cause the elevators could only take a few at a time and the stairs were full of people. One teenage girl was sobbing but most people were pretty calm. We got to the lobby and just as we got there the doors automatically locked. I like, half woke up, to the point where I realized I was dreaming but was still in it and told people to break the lobby windows so they could escape that way while we worked on the doors to get the bed ridden people out. Everyone made it and I turned around to see this big tall building engulfed in flame.

Then I made myself wake all the way up.

359,Dream Prediction Came True (?),Dreams,"I always record my dreams the first thing I wake up in the morning cause it’s fun. Okay here’s the story:

I’m friends with this guy.. let’s call him Eugene. A few weeks ago on my daily commute to school I saw him on the bus. Which was surprising but I assumed it was nothing because I took a bus later than my usual one. He later told me that he shifted house recently. I didn’t think much of it since we were friends who drifted quite a bit so I didn’t ask anymore questions.

Fast forward to today, I was looking through some of my dream entries I’ve made and I came across one that mentioned: 

Texting Eugene while walking up the escalator at the shopping mall near my school. 
He mentioned that he moved house nearer to the school and only takes a few moments to reach school 

Weird isn’t it? To add on:

The date I wrote was TWO weeks before I met Eugene on the bus and the week before I met Eugene we had a one week school holiday so I couldn’t have met him. That leave us around 4-5 days of meeting before we met on the bus. Which then is also hard to say because like I said earlier, the only reason why I met him was because I took a later bus.

In this dream it starts out in an old mobile home that was my grandmothers and we had usually stayed weekends there.  Im looking at her in the kitchen talking to her and everything is fine at first. I see her eyes fill with terror and she covers her face with both of her hands and starts bawling. it was really loud and about that time I turn around and look towards the bedroom and all I see is a shadow...still as can be. staring back at me with horrible pressure.

361,Moon People,Dreams,"Alright so I had two weird dreams last night but the first one was the coolest. All I remember from the beginning of the dream was flying around with Hulk and Spider-man while carrying some type of elongated energy source. At first, we were fighting off the people that were trying to take out energy source and spider-man couldn’t fly, but when the earth was safe (and also kinda smashed) we left for another planet. Hulk ended up surprising spider-man with a jet pack and we all got space suits so that we could go out into space. I remember feeling the change in pressure as we broke through the atmosphere and I also felt the weightlessness of outer space. We flew straight for a while following Hulks directions when we accidentally get pulled into the moons gravity and fall onto the surface of the moon. We then found a building that looked familiar and it was actually a top secret project for some other marvel heroes. When we went inside, the place was ransacked. We knew that our friends were in trouble so we had do find them. Upon searching the building, we heard crying coming from a room in the back. It was a little blonde headed boy looking at a picture of his father sitting at a desk. The room looked like it was set up to be a child’s room. I slowly approached the boy and asked him what was wrong but he wouldn’t talk, he just looked at me and stopped crying and then hugged me.  Then I picked him up and heard a gunshot from outside and a yell from hulk. At this point I found a mini fridge and put the kid in it and told him to stay put. Then I found a G21 Pistol and several rounds in a pile on a couch pillow. I filled the magazine and ran to the window to see Hulk crushing these blue skinned humanoids that were completely naked and covered in red blood. And that’s when I woke up.",0,moon people alright two weird dream last night first one coolest remember beginning dream flying around hulk spider man carrying type elongated energy source first fighting people trying take energy source spider man fly earth safe also kinda smashed left another planet hulk ended surprising spider man jet pack got space suit could go space remember feeling change pressure broke atmosphere also felt weightlessness outer space flew straight following hulk direction accidentally get pulled moon gravity fall onto surface moon found building looked familiar actually top secret project marvel hero went inside place ransacked knew friend trouble find upon searching building heard cry coming room back little blonde headed boy looking picture father sitting desk room looked like set child room slowly approached boy asked wrong talk looked stopped cry hugged picked heard gunshot outside yell hulk point found mini fridge put kid told stay put found g pistol several round pile couch pillow filled magazine ran window see hulk crushing blue skinned humanoid completely naked covered red blood woke

The sky was an odd almost purple/blue and something started happening that made us go outside. I stood and stared at the sky in awe as all the planets were lining up horizontal in the sky all in my view. I looked over a bit and saw planet earth staring at me. All the planets started to come closer and appeared bigger and bigger until they almost dissolved or exploded. It was almost like a show or something that someone/something was putting on.. after the planets were gone there were large rectangles that reminded me of cards in the sky, and I can’t remember what they were doing exactly but I remember it being a showing of sorts like a tv screen.  After they vanished I woke up. I was in awe and the dream is still making me feel some type of way.

I look at his house and notice that the barn (it was an aluminum barn with a sliding door) was open and the lights were on and the house lights were on too, I made him turn around and drop me off because besides family no one is supposed to be there. I go inside and it’s a grandma and grandson that I kinda recognize. (Maybe from the funeral? I don’t know) she tells me they are just visiting. Everything is moved out of the house but still I go down the hall starting to cry and I go into his room and look around, I go to the window and I look outside and there is my dad (keep in mind he died from cancer so he really didn’t look the best) he had a cut on the upper right of his forehead and he looked kinda sick but not nearly as bad as he was. Blown away I run outside and the first thing he says to me is “I need to find the pistol up in the barn the butcher fucked me up” (to kill himself I guess?) as he starts walking to the barn I follow in hysterics where eventually about halfway up he just stops and turns to me and says “first though” he comes in and tries to hug me but stops himself and says “I can’t touch you it’ll fuck you up” I understood and we kinda chit chatted for a second before he tells me before he died one of his friends is getting me a job as a truck driver.

365,Robot got angry when I told him I was dreaming.,Dreams,"I took the bus ( after a day of school because I had my bag with me).
 The driver was a friend that I know in real life.
When we arrived at my bus stop I notice that I forgot my bag in the bus but the bus was just starting to leave. 
So I told myself that I have to catch up the bus to take back my bag. That's when I saw a person in a car who is a robot but had the physical characteristics of a human, in my dream people didn't trusted him but because of the situation I had to get my bag back as soon as possible so I asked the robot if I could get in his car and follow the bus. At first he looked dubious but he finally agreed. It was from that moment that I became Lucid and I realized that I was dreaming.
Insides the robot's car, following the bus. 
Then I remembered this post on r/Dreams where someone said that when he said that he was lucid dreaming, the characters of his dreams, would get angry but if he told them that it was not a problem and that despite all they still ""exist"", they were not going to get angry. 
So I had the idea to tell the robot that I was dreaming and that despite everything it still existed. 
When I tried to told him that he just god angrier and the dream stoped.
He was really angry.

373,The Black Eyed Child Wants In,Dreams,"I had a dream recently that someone was knocking at my back door. It was daytime in the dream, and everything was very vivid and clear. My dining room and kitchen were exactly the same as in my waking world, which doesn't usually happen. I knew I was dreaming and I wanted to see where this would go.

I opened my back door and standing at my steel security door is a little boy. He was maybe eight or ten years old, not quite four feet tall. Blonde, blue eyes, the picture of innocence.

""Hi. I'm your new neighbor, my family moved in next door.""

""Is that so? I did not see you move in.""

""We moved in over night.""

""Oh, I see. Welcome to the neighborhood.""

The child's eyes lock to mine and, unblinking, he asks, ""will you let me in?""

""Why should I let you in?""

""You should let me in.""

Me, amused, ""why?""

""Because my mom needs to borrow something from your kitchen.""

""Why didn't she come to ask herself?""

""She sent me.""

""I can see that. What does your mom need?""

""You should let me in and I can get it.""

""Get what?""

""Let me in.""

""No.""

A black, viscous, oily substance started oozing down from the child's hairline. He reached up and tried the door knob. Locked.

""Let. Me. In.""

Black cracks began to form in his once-perfect face.

""Why do you want in so badly?""

His hair became dirty and his clothes tattered and covered in filth.

""Let me in.""

He continued struggling against the locked knob.

""I'm not letting you in.""

His eyes turned solid black and his skin a pale-gray.

""Let me in!"" the not-child finally shouted.

I calmly reached into the neck of my shirt and pulled out my Benedictine medal. The not-child flinched at the sight of it.

""I will not let you in. I know you are not from here; you lie. You are not welcome here.""

He stiffened and seemed to involuntarily take a step back.

""Leave this place, now.""

He snarled, then turned and walked away. At that point, I woke up.

I had a good idea for a prank so I told Sam and he let me do it. I told Sams little bro that I’d pay him 50 cents if he doused himself in gasoline. He did and I gave him the money. Sam came out of the gas station store with a box of matches. I had the good idea to tell him I’d pay him 10 dollars if he’d drink the gas. He took the gas hose thingie, held it up to his mouth, and chugged it for a solid 5 seconds. Then I was like “hey catch” and I threw a lit match at him. He immediately erupted into flames. There was also a water hose thingie next to the gas for no reason but he picks up the gas one instead and he burns even more. All while Sam and I are laughing our butts off. The end result was a big pile of charcoal. Then a couple of adults asked if we charcoaled him throughout the rest of the dream and we said no and they believed us.

376,A Breakdown In The Countryside,Dreams,"I dreamt that I was crying during a mental breakdown while walking along a lonely road in the countryside. I briefly looked up and took notice of a farm even though there were no animals, just crops.  


I saw the farmhouse and collapsed on the porch. I then heard a man's voice shouting ""Who's there?""  


I looked up and saw my late father looking out the window at me. He shouted ""Son, are you alright?!""  


""Dad?""  


""Yes son, it's me. It's your father.""  


He then opened the door and took me by the hands in order to help me stand up.  


""Son, you look awful. What happened? Where's your mom and your sister?""  


""Dad, they are coming but they want to stay. They just want to get away from the city for awhile.""  


""Son, just come in."" I obliged.  


We entered the living room where he gestured at me to sit by the fireplace given the rainy weather.  
""Son, do you want something to drink?"" he asked me.  


""What do you have, Dad?""  
""Tell me what you want and I'll get it for you.""  
""Um...Diet Coke?""  
""I do got some Diet Coke, but before I get it for you, be forewarned there is someone else in this house you should not talk to at all. If he appears, don't say anything to him.""  


""Who?"" I asked.

&#x200B;

""You'll see."" he said back to me.  


I then heard a noise coming from the backyard and looked out a window. I saw another man with his back to me tending to the crops with a physique similar to my father's.  
""Dad?! Who's he?!"" I shouted.  


The other man turned and looked right at me. He looked exactly like my father.  
""Dad?"" I asked. ""Why does that man look exactly like you?""  
""Son, let me show you something."" He then removed a book from a bookshelf and showed me a page.  
""Son, after I went, I knew I had to keep watch over you and the rest of the family for as long as possible. In fact, I'm still doing it right now and will for as long as I will be able to.""  
""But what about your twin out there?"" I asked.  


My father walked to the backyard and got into an argument with his other self. He said to his other self, ""Help me with the boy. Can't you see he's upset and crying?! He needs someone to comfort him. You know I can't do this by myself.""  
What shocked me next was what my father's other self said, ""Fella, the boy is showing emotion. He still isn't a real man. Real men can't show emotion because it's a sign of weakness. Now if you excuse me, let me try to shove a smoke into the boy's mouth to see if he can get a high.""  


""Don't you dare!"" shouted my real father. ""Son, get back into the house right now!"" I obliged.  


The dream ended with my mom and my sister showing up and being allowed to stay. However, my father's other self continued to be a threat.  


Then I woke up.  


Some ideas I had after I had this dream happened was that males can be one of two types:  
\-Understanding, caring, someone who rejects gender stereotypes, and believes being emotional is okay.  
\-Refusing to understand others, overtly arrogant, overtly masculine, and someone who believes that if a male shows emotion it is a sign of weakness.

377,The beasts from the void,Dreams,"My dream was last year around this time-  I was an anxious wreck.  College was taking a hold of my mental health along with working too many jobs, it was not a good time, and I would start to worry about my health, my life and other worrying thoughts.  Anyways that’s just context, I’ll get to the dream-

I was in an apocalyptic world, it didn’t look apocalyptic but I knew it was.  Maybe it was the lack of people, or that I was in an industrial area.  everything was so crisp, I was following train tracks, and stopped at a house to rest with my group.  It was a hazy, but nice 80’s themed room, with green accents.  Eventually we moved on for our job., now determined. The job was to hunt the beast, that was plaguing the area.  I was anxious and in fear, yet nothing around me should have scared me.  It was all empty, like it was just us in the entire world. We wound corners, ducked under boarded up doors, and searched.  I turned the corner and saw the beast.  Ripples of the void emanated across its body.  It looked like a scaled up buffalo/bear/monster.   It saw us, and we were terrified.  The beast charged, yet something changed, as if someone had a hand on my shoulder.  I felt tears and energy in my eyes, I confronted the beast.  I held gun up but did not shoot.  The strangest thing was that I was terrified up until this point, but as I stared at it, I felt powerful, strong, safe, and the beast to me felt sad, foiled, and leaching; as if the leach got torn off and now its ability to consume was no more.  The beast began to crumble and melt down into this small slimy dog creature, it than ran off under a door.  

At that moment, I felt light, and the world began to fade.  I was then in the middle of space.  Celestial bodies hovered, and a star like our sun gleamed across the cosmo.  I flew around for a bit but then I saw it.  It was a huge void of the same substance the beast was made out of, writhing around - like a nest, absolutely massive.  I felt small, so small.  The beast was nothing to this.  I was not afraid, the sea of fear larger than I could imagine, but I was not afraid, but more...... concerned.

I awoke and felt light.  The smell of fall vibrates my body today and it reminded me of the dream.  I have not had anxiety attacks like before the dream since.  I still have vidid dreams, I’ve always had- but nothing quite like this one.  I’m very thankful I had that dream.",0,beast void dream last year around time anxious wreck college taking hold mental health along working many job good time would start worry health life worrying thought anyways context get dream apocalyptic world look apocalyptic knew maybe lack people industrial area everything crisp following train track stopped house rest group hazy nice themed room green accent eventually moved job determined job hunt beast plaguing area anxious fear yet nothing around scared empty like u entire world wound corner ducked boarded door searched turned corner saw beast ripple void emanated across body looked like scaled buffalo bear monster saw u terrified beast charged yet something changed someone hand shoulder felt tear energy eye confronted beast held gun shoot strangest thing terrified point stared felt powerful strong safe beast felt sad foiled leaching leach got torn ability consume beast began crumble melt small slimy dog creature ran door moment felt light world began fade middle space celestial body hovered star like sun gleamed across cosmo flew around bit saw huge void substance beast made writhing around like nest absolutely massive felt small small beast nothing afraid sea fear larger could imagine afraid concerned awoke felt light smell fall vibrates body today reminded dream anxiety attack like dream since still vidid dream always nothing quite like one thankful dream

386,"Had Two Dreams, This Night and This Morning: First Dream is about this girl who always seem to need some help. Second Dream is this girl who is trying to kill me.",Dreams,"So I had two dreams and I don't know if they're connected. I'll talk about the first dream first. 

This started off in a building where our review classes were held. (In real life, I'm attending a review classes to prepare for my board exams). So in our class, there are, as usual, a group of friends. In my case, I'm in a group that compose of us three boys. 

There is this one girl though who are staring at us most often and we always see her every time wherever we are, like a stalker. At one time, this girl need help. Two of my friends decided not to, because they said they were busy. So, she asked me instead, and of course, I did help her. So, she asked me to follow her. I followed her and end up what appeared to be a guardhouse. We rest there for a while and talked. I told her that I was sorry because most of the times I want to help her, but decided not to, because I'm probably waiting to be asked. I don't recall what she said afterwards. After we talked, the guardhouse moved like its bringing us to somewhere.

After that is the second dream. 

The started off with me trying to teach this girl in this recently abandoned and bloody building. It's like a police station. After I finished teaching her, she told me thanks, and then she asked me if I know why she brought me here. I said no, then she told me, ""to kill you"". I got shivers and surprised, so I said, ""what?"" She then asked me if I know what happened in the place where we are. I shook my head. She then proceeds to tell the story of what happened in this place. 

I also dreamed in her point of view, on how she bloodied the place. It starts off with her in a room with a police officer interrogating her, and then, both hear the people panicking outside. There are zombies coming inside the station. She opened the door so that zombies can get inside her room. Two zombies came inside, one going for the officer and one going for the girl. The girl used the bars of the door as a cover so that she won't get bit but the officer uses his pistol to shoot the two zombies. The girl said thanks and said that they are not the only zombies. Because of that sound, more zombies are coming inside the room. The girl used the door again as a cover but the officer keeps shooting, until he's eaten. The girl used this as an opportunity to run away.

Now, back to my own point of view. When she's finished talking, she opened the vent and run away to the exit and locked the doors. I tried to open the doors as I was locked inside and told me that if I want to stay alive, I have to stay on the vents. Zombies see me, so I need to go to the events before I am eaten. Luckily, I am just in time. 

The next day, I'm still alive and she went back and asked for my help. I did help her but I made a mistake and told me that, ""You have no friends, you stink. You should die."" She ran away to the exit again. I was locked again but this time I managed to break and escaped. She just ran away farther, I didn't bother to chase her because I was wandering anywhere just to get home. Fortunately, my teacher back in high school and the girl I know from the review class, let's name her Pauline, sees me along the highway. (This girl is different from the first dream, and I know this girl in real life, so is the teacher.) They asked what happened and I explained. Pauline seems to be going to the review class, and I asked her if it's okay for me to come along. She said yes. 

I think that's it.

387,Had a weird dream that there was a fire at my practicum school,Dreams,"So, for context, I am a university student in my last year and I am studying to be a high school Spanish teacher. I go to a practicum school to practice teaching and my host teacher (who is amazing and I look up to her very much) is also our instructor for our practicum course. 

In this dream, I was at my host school and it was the first class of the day. All the students in this class are freshmen and my host teacher decided to have my teach that lesson for the class hour. I was at the front of the class going over some Spanish sentences when the fire alarms went off. Some students casually left and I looked at my host teacher for some indicators as to what we were about to do. She smiled as she normally does and said, ""It's okay, just keep teaching."" So I followed her instructions and kept teaching as she did some work at her desk, still smiling and observing how I was teaching. This teacher is like the kindest woman I know, so it wasn't rare for her to smile because she is almost always smiling. Though I thought it was odd that she was smiling as the fire was taking some of the desks, so the remaining students just moved to other desks that were not being burned. A few more students laughed and my host teacher just smiled and said goodbye. Then, the announcements came on and the principal said that the fire was a little more serious than we thought and that at this point we should all be leaving. The remaining students left the classroom until it was just me, my host teacher, and now suddenly a little baby that was hers. She was about to leave so I grabbed my host teacher's baby and she said ""Oh thanks!"" As if I were grabbing her purse or something that she left behind.

It was such a weird and comical dream. It isn't that odd for me to dream about being in a Spanish class because I have had dreams about being in Spanish class since I was in high school. This dream, however, was weird because of all the crazy things that happened. My host teacher does not have any children yet, though she asked me last week if I wanted kids then we talked about how she wants kids, but she still isn't sure yet because she is afraid.

Could anyone give me some insight as to what in the heck this dream means? I can't stop laughing over the fact that she almost left her baby in the burning classroom then thanked me very casually about picking him up.

388,Dog visit,Dreams,"I have been having rather difficult days at work being under a lot of stress and I came home today and took a long nap and had a very vivid dream. 

In my dream, my 11 year old dachshund who we put down 2 years ago appeared. I was sitting on a bench and suddenly felt a little dog zoom over to me. I swore I could feel his soft coat and gentle nose boops and I looked down and told him “thanks for coming to see me, I’ve missed you so much” and felt his happy tail slapping my leg as I pet him. I was euphoric. I swore I felt his presence!  I sat at that bench petting him and feeling so carefree, then I just watched him happily trot away into nothing. When I woke up, instead of being disappointed that it was all a dream or sad that he was gone, I felt grateful and satisfied that I got to say hello.

390,My name was Isa,Dreams,"It was an interesting dream. It felt almost real and I remember it very vividly, which is uncommon to me. The dream was set in a futuristic steampunk environment, I was in a group of social outcasts that were participating in a project, but I guess I woke up before realizing what the project was. My part was to organize a fake wedding for myself and a guy from that group and make the public believe we did it. The weird part to me, was that everyone knew my name, but referred to me as Isa. And they would call me Isa and I would respond to it like it's nothing. After waking up I found that part really weird and decided to Google Isa and found out it's a Hebrew or Arabic name for Jesus?!

Hope you guys are having a wonderful week. I know I am. 

So I've been flying in my dreams for a while now (maybe 3 years). It's so much fucking fun. Like straight zooming around the place. Last night I was flying around a rollercoaster theme park. The sky was so blue. I was in 3rd person mode. I was able to go so high it was ridiculous....  I FELT ALL THE FEELINGS. It was beyond real. Extremely lucid. This went on for a while and I didn't want it to end. I knew it was dangerous but I couldn't help myself I felt invinsble .

At some point it became scary, I was going too fast and I went too high and crashed (into some sort of structure). I numbed out and time slowed down. I could hear parents crying... 

Suddenly I'm in 1st person mode. The feeling of ' O fuck' came over me ... I'm in a vacant / eerie building.....  Hovering .. .. I look down .. I'm not in my body ... I'm in a misshapen globe of pixelated flesh.... I have a feeling that ""this is the interlude , this is where I wait until I am 100%""   .. A black and grey punch bag style  mannequin is next to me.

392,Worst dream I’ve ever had..,Dreams,"Okay I literally just woke up about 30 minutes ago and decided to share my dream here. I’ve never posted on Reddit before but this dream scared me and I want to share.. I had a dream the whole entire sky was red. There were barely trees anymore, no plants, no grass.. etc. everyone had to stay indoors because the sun was too intense you couldn’t go out or look out the window. The sun was also red. It didn’t look like the sun anymore. It looked more like a ball of fire instead of glowing (Trying to describe everything well since my dream was so detailed) All of a sudden the ground shook really hard. Just imagine thunder coming from the ground instead of the sky. That’s how it felt. The sun wasn’t in the sky anymore. it kept getting lower and lower towards the ground. When the sun almost made a reaching point to the ground me and my family got in a circle and told each other we loved each other.  It’s like in my dream EVERYONE knew what was going on without anyone speaking on what was happening. Nobody could be scared because we knew the day would come. It’s like everyone was prepared for it in a way. The ground shook one last time and you could hear horns very LOUDLY. I can’t describe where the horns came from. It’s like the sound came from out of the sky. The horns were intense also, everyone had to hold their ears. I remember the one second the sun reached the ground it’s like everything exploded/ vanished and there was NOTHING. Like nothing ever existed.

394,"In my dream, I placed a baby for adoption and then changed my mind",Dreams,"This dream just really freaked me out because it was so insanely realistic. In this dream I was about the same age I actually am (18), and I was pregnant (in real life I’m not). I decided to place my baby for adoption. I met the potential adoptive mother and she seemed great. She was in her late 40s, had already raised three kids, who were close to my age, and lived in a peaceful, semi-rural, middle-class town. I decided she could adopt my baby. She said she was ok with open adoption (bio mom can maintain contact with child) or closed adoption (bio mom does not contact child), and I could choose which option I’d prefer. 

Then, after an unknown period of time passed, I gave birth to a boy. He was a little bit premature and had to stay in the hospital for a few extra days. I stayed with him, and his adoptive family visited him too. During this time, I got to know my baby’s future siblings: a high school aged girl, an 18-year-old girl, and a twenty-something guy. They were horrible people. I don’t remember exactly what they said or did, but they were awful. And I started to question whether or not I actually wanted my baby to be raised by the same lady who raised these three. As the days went by, this family started seeming sketchier and sketchier to me. At one point, I just needed a break from being in the hospital with my baby. Some of my friends invited me to hang out, so I left for a few hours to hang out with them and get my mind off things.

I had only told a couple of my closest friends about the pregnancy, and I hadn’t seen the rest of my friends in several months. They were all like, “long time no see! What have you been up to?” And I was like, “I gave birth!” And they were like, “WHAT?!” and I told them the whole story. And then I broke down crying. And I realized that I didn’t want an open adoption. Or a closed adoption. Or any adoption at all. Even though I was only 18, and single, I needed to raise my son. I couldn’t leave him with those weird near-strangers. So I ran back to the hospital to find out if it wasn’t too late to change my mind.

396,"Weird relationship dream, need help interpreting",Dreams,"
So in this dream S.O. and I and his mom live in a large complex, there's a pool and bridges and superior landscaping. 

I am into roller derby, and there was a girl in my roller derby team that I had confided a lot to about my relationship with my S.O.
(Recently rediscovered my love of skating and have made a friend I've confided in) 

I walked into the garage one morning and there was a blow up doll laying across an open box full of other stuff I couldn't make out in the dream. S.O's mom is packing this stuff up. I ask her ""what's this?"" And she says it's S.O's and that there's another one he has already put away. 

I see a scene where he is storing things in this storage shed that only he has a key to. (Is he hiding things from me?)

Then his mom asks me if I saw the lubes that got sent to us (a possibility to ease friction, but rejected) 

I say no, And she says he probably put that in his storage too

Later I am near the pool and his sister says ""did you know our mom cut off her clitoris to keep him from playing with it?"" I say no,  are you kidding?
She said ""yeah, she got tired of it so she did that""

Then I'm walking with my cat and I'm far away from the main house, I have to go to the bathroom. I jump into this trailer with my cat and tell my cat that I'm gonna pee in this little box. The box was about 4x4x2 bronze and trimmed in gold, very ornate (Self expression is confined,  cat is my friend)

Then the trailer starts moving, and I don't pee in the little box, I look out over the edge and a guy has picked up this long hitch to the trailer and is literally carting  us back to the main house, I'm ok with this because I gotta go to the bathroom. (Inability to Express, not where I need to be) 

It ends with me putting makeup on a guy that looks like Russell brand, he's sitting on a trail and drawing something on paper.  I put one shade for him on his upper cheek and one shade for me on his lower cheek

399,Dream that played like an action movie with a lesson about friendship.,Dreams,"  

I was on a tour bus with a band. Things were fun watching movies and shows with my friends on the go. But something went wrong. Zombies started attacking. We used our bus as a mobile base. While fighting off zombies I got caught in an explosion. For a while I was dazed and couldn’t remember who I was. I also had superpowers. I could fly, I had super strength and durability. Zombies were no longer a threat.

(This is where things get interesting.)

As the memories came flooding back to me and I remembered who I was, I made a bold decision. I felt insecure about who I was before. So, I lied to everyone that I still did not remember who I was. I acted like a new person. We moved our base from a tour bus to a university campus, where we built a large community of survivors, whom I protected. The people loved me like a celebrity and loved when I showed off my powers.

My close friends, however, were worried about my memories. They kept prodding my memory. They asked about what I know and what I don’t know. I made mistakes in this. I focused to much on trying to answer incorrectly about questions only the real me would know. I was not thinking about my new personality. I made contradictions. I told someone I didn’t want to kill animals, but I killed a wild bull shortly later. My close friends figured it out. They were angry at me. They refused to talk to me. The survivors still loved me, but my friends felt distant.

Zombies still attacked the University and I still killed them. I no longer felt a thrill from fighting like I used to. The cheers and celebration from the survivors no longer excited me. I just wanted to talk to my friends again.

(There was a long story about a super villain in a lab here, but it seemed unrelated so I will put it in the comments if you wish to read it)

A new survivor at our base was a psychic and could answer any one question. I could only be one question, but because I saved her, she offered me two. But I only wanted to ask one. “How can I get my friends back.” Instead of answering directly she told me to rest on a near by bed. She left, and after a short while she came back with my friends. I admitted to them that I lied, and I was sorry. I told them I didn’t like who I was, and I saw an opportunity to be someone new. Someone special. Someone people would respect.

It felt warm and comfortable, like walking around during winter with your jacket open. Periodically, I felt this chill wind, not particularly unpleasant. 

I was walking around alone until I found a seemingly empty gas station. I walked up to the lawn in front of it, and sat down at a game of legos. I looked at it and felt the need to rebuild the lego building, which in my mind was imperfect. Rather than taking the pieces apart gradually and carefully, I just broke it apart, also damaging and bending some of the larger pieces. 

While I was concentrating on the building, a child who I was certain I never met, began telling his friend about me. I remembered the story as it was being told. He said that a long time ago, another friend and myself took a joke too far. The image came up of me blocking the passage way to a small wooden stall, where there was this little girl inside. I was waving around a gun at her, yelling something. She had a face of confusion rather than terror. By accident (or intentionally, I don't know), I pulled the trigger and killed her. I don't remember the moment of impact, and there was no blood either. 

Now I started to remember the story he was telling a little better. Although everything was dark and distorted I managed to recollect what I did. To cover up the crime I had to burn her. The friend I was with seemed to have no influence on my actions. I burned the wooden stall to ashes - everything became covered in this black material that resembled molasses, but animate. Rather than produce flames it was like she was being consumed by the blackness. 

These images flashed in my eyes and I woke up soon after.

When I woke up I felt rather sick and confused. Now that I try to recall the dream it feels like the girl I killed was someone familiar, but I can't put my finger on who she was.",0,perplexing dream sequence started trip french town pretty sure dreaming child midnight late winter snow melting forming black stream pavement reflecting light lamp felt warm comfortable like walking around winter jacket open periodically felt chill wind particularly unpleasant walking around alone found seemingly empty gas station walked lawn front sat game lego looked felt need rebuild lego building mind imperfect rather taking piece apart gradually carefully broke apart also damaging bending larger piece concentrating building child certain never met began telling friend remembered story told said long time ago another friend took joke far image came blocking passage way small wooden stall little girl inside waving around gun yelling something face confusion rather terror accident intentionally know pulled trigger killed remember moment impact blood either started remember story telling little better although everything dark distorted managed recollect cover crime burn friend seemed influence action burned wooden stall ash everything became covered black material resembled molasses animate rather produce flame like consumed blackness image flashed eye woke soon woke felt rather sick confused try recall dream feel like girl killed someone familiar put finger

Now, I wrote here once that I usually have the most craziest dreams ever, like literal movies going on.
Now the thing I like about my dreams is that I always remember them, every little detail.. 

So the weird thing is, that I’m used to having odd dreams but they’re never this vivid and nor lucid 
But every dream I had for the past month or so was lucid dreams, I control everything and really feel that if I’m living in another dimension than dreaming (cause ya know when it’s a dream you understand it’s a dream cause it’s all weird and doesn’t make sense) 
But these ones really make sense, my family is always there and they are all perfectly normal and we do stuff that are pretty much normal, like no flying or stuff that can only happen in dreams..
What I think is that when I sleep I just become myself in my other dimension and live my “second life”... idk 🤨

403,I had a dream where I escaped a shooting I would’ve died in,Dreams,"The title isn’t all that happened, and I’ll try to tell it in the best detail that I can, but this happened about ten minutes ago and I need somewhere to vent it

So I was in a bar, just talking and drinking, nothing much happening. After what felt like about half an hour of just talking to customers and the bartender, some guy walks in with a thick coat and sunglasses. I didn’t think much of it, and now that I think about it I didn’t even know the season in my dream.
The guy goes into the bathroom for about five minutes. The bartender then looked at me and quietly said to get the hell out, and I realized what might’ve been happening. 
Apparently there was another guy on the stairs who was in the middle of loading what could’ve only been a suppressed SMG, and for some reason I had to go down a set of stairs to escape him.
I sprint down the stairs and jump to the bottom instead of going down the last three, and I just booked it into a mall, and sprinted into a stores bathroom to call the police.
The police came, and apparently some guy with an open carry permit killed the two shooters, but the bar and surrounding area was massacred, and I would’ve died had I not been told to run.

Edit: TL:DR I had a dream about escaping what would’ve been a shooting that killed me, called 911 and some guy with an open carry permit killed the shooters after they destroyed that bar, where I was sitting



This is the most accurately I could have described it, and I never want to see anything like that again, but does anyone know if this might have some underlying meaning? I’ve never naturally woken up this morning, and I’ve never seen anything that shook me up more, so any help would be appreciated. And please don’t ask why there was a bar upstairs in a mall, because I have no clue why.

405,Weird Prophetic Portal Dream,Dreams,"I had a really fascinating dream last night involving some sort of ancient portal and some incredible real-world timing (more on that near the end!).

I can't remember how it began, but it involved me toting around with a small group of people (select family members & personalities) in some massive recreational complex. Sometime early in the dream, we learned that there was an ancient mysterious portal/corridor shaped like a massive old-school oxygen tank left on an abandoned balcony isolated within the complex. The portal was closed but there were reportedly some magical occurrences surrounding it. Legend told that it could be opened for the individual(s) that activate it by visiting it at specific times throughout the day, those times needing to be deciphered via riddles that the portal (or some guy overseeing the portal, I can't remember) revealed upon each individual visit. After visiting the portal at the right hour five different times, the portal would magically open for your eyes only, allowing you to see what's on the other side.

Early on in the dream I split from the group to hang out with some random Mclovin from *Superbad*-looking kid for some reason and watched from afar as they went through several trials and tribulations before eventually being granted access to see what's inside the portal. They peeked inside as a brief flash of light emitted from the corridor before emerging from the portal and explaining that they were shown some kind of vision and nothing more.

Eager to learn the details myself, I began following the riddles and arriving at the portal at the specified times, each visit a bit vague in memory but filled with odd magical happenings. Finally, I arrived at the 4th/5th riddle, and the riddle went somewhat like this (yes, it was ridiculously simple in retrospect, it was a dream after all):

""Visit the portal shortly after the base ball game ends, at 8:30 PM.""

So out of nowhere, practically straight out of the movie *Field of Dreams*, an old-school early 20th century game of baseball with the players and all (in the style of old black & brown photographs from the era, may I add) commenced inside the complex next to the balcony, I watched the game from nearby, the game ended shortly thereafter, I visited the portal for the final time and something amazing happens.

I look into it, the whole portal turns bright, and... in real life my S8 phone starts playing the ""Skyscraper"" alarm tone nearby (which fit the tone of the moment absolutely perfectly may I add) and I wake up to the sound of the alarm at the exact time I had set it for before falling asleep.

So, as the ultimate twist, the portal somehow canonically leads to me waking up in real life! (Which sounds like a pretty great concept for an actual book or movie if you think about it!) I mean, it makes sense since the only thing the other people in the dream could see is a ""vision"" while I actually got to go through the portal and essentially ""control"" the vision as if I was the ""chosen one"" or something. More or less resembling the entire plot of *Being John Malkovich*, basically.

Nonetheless it was a very odd yet interesting dream, definitely one of the cooler ones I've had in awhile. I hope my description of the dream made for some good entertainment, at least!

407,Recurring dreams feel like an alternate reality,Dreams,"Over the past couple years I’ve had countless dreams that take place in a sort of quasi-utopian post apocalyptic indoor ecosystem. They’re never sequential but I’m always wandering around this massive structure, finding new places and deconstructed memories(old houses, malls, resorts, neighborhoods) that exist inside of it. Even when I’m “outdoors” I get the feeling that I’m in my own personal Truman Show, and everyone else is too. I could be lumping these things together because they all feel very nostalgic, even the places I’ve discovered, but for whatever reason I always wake up feeling like I went back to a familiar place. 

Last night I found a massive white plaza I haven’t seen before and took a spherical elevator that goes outside of the building and onto the roof. There were groups of strangers gathered together quietly overlooking a destroyed NYC. Everything about it was very somber, like we were coming to terms with the reality we tried to hide from. I don’t remember much after that but I woke up feeling very strange and sad.

409,Mysterious Dream I was Chased by a Rabid Bear and a Viking Hillbilly,Dreams,"I recently had a dream that I was playing Skyrim (in what looked like my future apartment, I don’t have my own apartment yet) and my girlfriend was watching. My character was running through the cold northern swamps when a super powerful vampire came out of nowhere and started shooting thunderbolts at me. My health was going down quickly so I took some powerful healing potions. When I exited the inventory menu the vampire kept shooting lightning bolts at me. My character ran out of health and was brilliantly resurrected because I had a special item in my inventory. I immediately turned my character into a vampire lord and used a massive drain life spell on the vampire and several other enemies that ran up shortly after I transformed.

 I had almost defeated all of them when a huge rabid bear that looked like it weighed at least 400 kg (900 lbs) ran up out of nowhere and hit me in the back. This bear had patches of hair missing, spots of hair that looked bleached and his eyes were glazed over. He did not give a fuck. He was crazy. After being hit by this massive rabid bear it took a huge chunk of my health away. It was at this point where I felt like my consciousness was now in that situation. It was real now.

I realized this bear was too strong to fight so I ran/hovered away as fast as I could. As I ran through the swamp away from this crazy bear I climbed over several very thick seemingly impenetrable bushes and thickets. Finally and strangely I came across a 100% modern two lane paved road that seemingly came from the swamp. I ran up it and when I thought I lost him my vampire form faded away and instead of my Skyrim character being there I appeared. I kept running, and saw the bear behind me again. I also saw a sports store/restaurant up the road. I ran towards it and I saw people there and a Maltese dog come running out past me and towards the bear. I was concerned for this little dog. But when he got to the bear it completely lost interest in chasing me and instead looked down at the tiny dog that stood close to it. It was as if they instantly became friends. The bear and the little dog investigated each other for a bit and subsequently just walked down the road in the opposite direction of me. I was very relieved to say the least.

I headed towards the sports store/ restaurant and as I got closer only a few meters away a huge man came out he looked to be nearly 210 centimeters (almost 7 feet) tall. He looked like a viking/hillbilly with red hair, a long beard and crazy looking eyes. He was easily 120 kg (260 lbs). He was wearing a baseball cap a red flannel shirt, blue overalls and dirty black boots. He angrily swung open the door and looked directly at me as if I had wronged him. I had a bad feeling about him so I ran. It was now sunset. As I ran into the parking lot behind the store I realized that the parking lot was surrounded by a 4 meter (12 feet) tall fence. I screamed out of frustration realizing I was trapped. Meanwhile as the man came closer he loudly said, “Why are you running Thomas? Why are you running away from the pain?” As he began talking I realized that this was an inherently good man, terrifying in demeanor but compassionate and kind hearted. He had no ill-will towards me. He laughed and said, “It’s a trap Thomas!” He stopped about 3 meters (10 feet) from me and raised his arms as if to worship something and loudly said. “Heaven is a trap!” This is all I remember.",0,mysterious dream chased rabid bear viking hillbilly recently dream playing skyrim looked like future apartment apartment yet girlfriend watching character running cold northern swamp super powerful vampire came nowhere started shooting thunderbolt health going quickly took powerful healing potion exited inventory menu vampire kept shooting lightning bolt character ran health brilliantly resurrected special item inventory immediately turned character vampire lord used massive drain life spell vampire several enemy ran shortly transformed almost defeated huge rabid bear looked like weighed least kg lb ran nowhere hit back bear patch hair missing spot hair looked bleached eye glazed give fuck crazy hit massive rabid bear took huge chunk health away point felt like consciousness situation real realized bear strong fight ran hovered away fast could ran swamp away crazy bear climbed several thick seemingly impenetrable bush thicket finally strangely came across modern two lane paved road seemingly came swamp ran thought lost vampire form faded away instead skyrim character appeared kept running saw bear behind also saw sport store restaurant road ran towards saw people maltese dog come running past towards bear concerned little dog got bear completely lost interest chasing instead looked tiny dog stood close instantly became friend bear little dog investigated bit subsequently walked road opposite direction relieved say least headed towards sport store restaurant got closer meter away huge man came looked nearly centimeter almost foot tall looked like viking hillbilly red hair long beard crazy looking eye easily kg lb wearing baseball cap red flannel shirt blue overall dirty black boot angrily swung open door looked directly wronged bad feeling ran sunset ran parking lot behind store realized parking lot surrounded meter foot tall fence screamed frustration realizing trapped meanwhile man came closer loudly said running thomas running away pain began talking realized inherently good man terrifying demeanor compassionate kind hearted ill towards laughed said trap thomas stopped meter foot raised arm worship something loudly said heaven trap remember

So in the dream, my dad works for the DEA as one of the people who actually goes in and busts drug houses and breaks down doors and the raids and the whole shebang. Well I decide to go out with friends or whatever, and first dream a while ago, the DEA was introduced during a dinner setting, then a couple different dreams a few weeks back, we went to a club. The dream last night we went to a party at a house, but there was a line to get into the party area after you enter the house. So my friend and I were waiting in line and I saw one of my dad’s DEA buddies inside the party, looking super out of place in strip club style wear. (It was a rave.) I grabbed my friend and whispered that we had to go. 

We get outside and I realize the car was parked several blocks away so my friend and I start making a run for it. After a few minutes of running, just as we make it to the car, there’s a huge explosion as the party house blows into smithereens. We are thrown to the ground, even though we are blocks away, with ringing ears and then as I’m standing up and getting my bearings after the explosion, I wake up. 

Every one of these dreams are the same premise, we go out, I see the DEA starting to do their thing, and then the place blows up.

416,Invisible monster,Dreams,"My ex gf turned the lights off, was at the edge of my bed naked in pitch darkness. I was touching her crotch, then realized it wasn't actually her. I was actually just using my fingers to rub against the inside of my comforter under the covers near my crotch (where my hands were irl upon awakening). Whatever that monster was, was somehow alerted that I was no longer feeling and see her anymore. I wasn't duped. Tried to get up and this invisible monster/force yelled in my face like a monster movie or Scooby Doo, I could feel its breathe on my face like a strong wind. At this point it tried to hold my arms and legs down and I was wrestling with it and could tell it was hovering over me. 

Then I started seeing weird things like a url bar to type in a website, I guess that it was trying to brainwash me or get me under control. I typed in Google somehow in this search bar I could see visibly. Erasing whatever it was trying to type. I also saw numbers spiraling in circles, kind of like green 0s and 1s in the matrix. I honestly felt like I was being brainwashed due to my waking up and realizing the monster wasn't her. End of Dream.   


When I woke up irl, I was laying on my back, with the same fingers grasping my comforter near my crotch in the pitch darkness. I was scared that something might still be there so I just breathed in a constant rhythm until I had the courage to put the light on, scared that something invisble would try to hold me down.  

I am pretty sure I slept on my stomach, which I almost do, 99% of the time, but I woke up on my back, hands on top of each other with my feet out. 

*Optional background*

How it started, we were on my bed, about a few feet apart laying down, looking in each others eyes, then we started kissing. While kissing, sucking each others lips and faces very hard mind you, one of my teeth cut the inside of her lip by her lower teeth. She said twice that I injured her and made a big deal out this, who ever that was. So I looked at it and it looked like there was meat coming out of her bite. So we went to my bathroom in another part of the house, she was naked somehow and said it's fine we'll just run in there fast and no one will see us. So we get in there and there's this shirt she gave me that I wore on our Anniversary a few years back that was in there lying on a counter that she threw at me, kind of like put this on. Even though I was clothed, she wasn't. So we are trying to I guess fix the bite. I end up naked and she wants to go back into my room. We get there and she shuts the light off, which is weird because we very rarely keeps the lights off. It's pitch black and I can't see anything. But I feel her with my foot (which were hanging out of my blanket irl mind you) and she gets near me, I start using my hand down there until I start realizing that it's not her. That is where it got very scary and is where I started this thread at.  

Dream interpretation?

418,The Fursuit Store (+Bonus Dream),Dreams,"I had a dream I drove by a fairly big fancy fursuit shop. They were processing my order or something, I think for a fursuit. Their motto was something like ""for the furries."" Me and my dad in and there and it was like a blue light in there. There were all these tails on the wall. I remember thinking/saying that I would go there to see some things once it was the time for my fursuit or whatever. I went into another area which had a much more conventional light. I walked out and thought of getting a Persona 3 Protagonist costume instead (which I actually wanted). There were other costume stuff outside the area on the wall. I didn't see a Gekkokaun uniform but I imagined it was there. I saw a light blue anime hair wig and a bunch of other wigs, then I saw a P3 MC wig, with a chibi version of the protagonist on the box. Then I woke up. I am kind of a furry IRL so this makes sense.

419,I couldn’t wake up from my dream,Dreams,"So last night/this morning I had the most stressful panic inducing dream I’ve had in a long time. 
In my dream I wake up to kids running around my house. They said the bear let them in and when I look around all my stuff is gone as if I was robbed. At this point I wake up in dream and think, oh man it was only a dream. Walk downstairs and all my stuff is gone again and the kids come running in. I walk around a bit and start to get stressed. Boom, wake up again and same thing. This time, the 3rd time, I realize I’m dreaming since I’m noticing differences from my actual house. So I close my eyes , a trigger to wake up, and I wake up relieved and start hearing kids again. So I panic and run downstairs, same deal. I tried to wake up 2 more times and the same thing, kids running around, my stuff is gone, and I realize I’m dreaming and try to wake up all the while I’m panicking in dream. When I do actually wake up I jump out of bed and listen for kids, nothing. See that all my stuff is there and sit down for a second. I tried to wake up like 5 times and couldn’t in dream and I felt like I didn’t even get any sleep. For the first half of the day I was worried I was going to wake up and have this panic filled loop happen again.

I want to confront this when it happens, but my body physically is paralyzed and I can’t move at all! I sometimes have the power to shape my lucid dreams, but typically only if it’s an overall positive dream. When it’s scary, I have no control over the situation.

426,Died in a dream last night then came back as a ghost.,Dreams,"Last night I had a dream where I was in my house and a man was in my room looking out of the window. He had a bomb vest so I snuck up on him and tried to put him in a choke hold but he flung me off and pointed a gun at me.

So, reacting to this I bolted out of the room and has to push past a load of random people in my house who I didn't know to get away, whereas he just shot them to clear a path 

Knowing that he was serious, I jumped out of the window and sprinted down the road to get away. My thought process was that I needed to find a busy crowd to mingle and escape- and what better busy crowd than Lecister Square? Because I live near a London underground station (in real life too) this was where I ran towards, alerting people on the way that there was a madman chasing me. I didn't expect much help but lots of people actually ran with me to block the guy's vision.

My luck ran out though when I got to the platform and the next train was due in ten minutes. I turned around to run back out and find an alternative but the guy was already slowly walking down the stairs. Unrelatedly, Boris Johnson and Sajid Javid also arrived just before this by walking along the tracks- Javid was wearing a wig which I complimented.

When the man began to slowly walk down the stairs everyone was shitting themselves and had clustered up at the back of the platform- even though I knew he only wanted me. Given this, I approached him and acknowledged there was no hope, but asked for a merciful death at least. To my surprise, he pulled out a poem and said to read it in my head, which I did (wish I could remember what it said). Once I finished it, I passed out and reawakened on the platform knowing I had died, except no one could see me. Walking down the road, I spotted my dad who was grieving, so I ran up and hugged him. He couldn't see me nor sense me, so I picked up two wireless earphones (which I could somehow do) and dangled them in front of him, alerting him to the fact that I was there. From here, we slowly began communicating through methods such as flour and chalk, until people actually became able to see and hear me again to the point they didn't realise I was dead.

Them my dad and me joined an Mongolian tribe and it all gets a bit hazy from there, but I do remember having a false awakening where I was disappointed for having lost my sort-of superpower.

Sidenote: I also have a fever right now so that definitely made it more vivid.

428,Two dreams of dying in one night,Dreams,"My first dream, I was in an old neighborhood I used to live in. I had a pistol so I started to shoot at random things. I then tried shooting someone but then I got anxious. I felt like the police were coming to find me, so I went across the street to find a private place to shoot myself. I ended up shooting myself in the head with the pistol I had. It was a little while until I woke back up in the dream and I felt my head. I had no wound so I was pretty confused. I ended up shooting myself in the head a second time, but I was still alive, although I felt the shot.

I woke up eventually from this dream because of my cat.

The second dream, I was with my mother (alive) and she was driving me around. There was a creek that she wanted to cross while we were driving but she wasn't sure if she was able to cross it without her car sinking into the water. She told my dad (alive) about wanting to but she was uncertain, so he decided to drive it instead. Before we drove into the creek, she asked him, ""if I die, will you save us?"" He didn't answer, but at the same time we all assumed he would of. As we drove in, the car started sinking almost immediately and everything was dark blue. I couldn't hold my breath or try to escape, so I ended up dying. I woke up after the dream and was gasping for air.

I've never had dreams about death, but I wasn't as terrified experiencing them.

I should note the only experience I have is security like my current job just sitting at a desk and doing patrolling, so I don’t know why this came to be because I never thought of it.

After I heard his request I told him that I would after leaving my job and later he went somewhere that I guess involved a  disguise or something because the next thing I see is he is wearing glasses and somehow looks like an old woman.

434,Dream about someone I look up to committing suicide,Dreams,"(trigger warning: talking about suicide)

I made a throwaway account for this because I feel like its a little bit personal.

Last night (early hours of October 8th, 2019), I fell asleep and before waking up, had a dream that an old teacher of mine committed suicide. I am currently in my second year of university, and he was very well-liked by myself and my high school friends who I still talk to, and he is one of my inspirations as a future teacher myself. He was always so happy and positive in the classroom, there is no way your spirits wouldn't be lifted in his room. 

I can't recall how the dream started, but I recall one of my best friends breaking the news to his girlfriend, who said ""No!!"" and started crying. I walked up and asked what was wrong, and she said to me: ""Mr. ___ killed himself."" I got so welled up in emotion and started crying on the spot. I couldn't even say anything, then everything started losing focus, and I woke up. 

I honestly wouldn't be posting this if everything in what I had described wasn't so vivid. I only remember that part of the dream, but I remember every detail of it. My friend was sitting on a table in a room (possibly a classroom), along with his girlfriend on his left side. I walked in from around a corner on their left side. 

This dream has been bothering me since this morning. I was never the type of person to think that dreams mean anything, but now I just can't help but think about this. Is my subconscious trying to tell me something about myself? Any help would be greatly appreciated.

If there is another subreddit that this would possibly have a good answer for this, please don't hesitate to tell me!",0,dream someone look committing suicide trigger warning talking suicide made throwaway account feel like little bit personal last night early hour october th fell asleep waking dream old teacher mine committed suicide currently second year university well liked high school friend still talk one inspiration future teacher always happy positive classroom way spirit lifted room recall dream started recall one best friend breaking news girlfriend said started cry walked asked wrong said mr killed got welled emotion started cry spot even say anything everything started losing focus woke honestly posting everything described vivid remember part dream remember every detail friend sitting table room possibly classroom along girlfriend left side walked around corner left side dream bothering since morning never type person think dream mean anything help think subconscious trying tell something help would greatly appreciated another subreddit would possibly good answer please hesitate tell

Over the course of the last few months, I’ve been having a sequence recur in my dreams.

My dreams don’t necessarily repeat themselves in their entirety. The one thing that does however, involves my teeth.

It usually goes like this . I start to feel my teeth, normally in the back of my mouth, start to loosen from my gums, and then they begin to rot out of my mouth. Sometimes, I have to pull them out, but it’s never painful.

I know this isn’t a lot to go on, but I was wondering if there is any explanation as to why this happens.

440,"My dreams are seriously exercises in world building. They are so elaborate. I've left out the less exciting stuff. Anyway, here's a funny dream I had while partially lucid/aware.",Dreams,"Fun dream last night:
So the dream was partially lucid(meaning I had awareness it was a dream and could control things--kind of.) I wasn't all-powerful, like I had hoped. I couldn't fly, but after practicing for hours, I discovered I could slowly float (learned this after falling off a roof.) I could move things with my mind, but not in a cool way. Things would just wiggle a bit or hover. Voila! 

I was a little disappointed, but determined. As the sun was setting, I decided to wonder around the city and experiment some more. I stumbled upon some light festival where people were propelling multi-colored brightly lit led-like projectiles and balloons into the night sky, some in the shapes of animals, flowers--anything you can imagine. Cool.
 What if I lit myself up and, I don't know,  float around or something?! Turns out I couldn't do that. I think I lit up one finger... Barely.

So now I'm stewing over my useless abilities when I come across a snack size packet of gummi bears(Haribo, because that's where it's at!) This'll cheer me up, but these 8 gummi bears aren't anywhere near sufficient. There's only one packet. Hm, maybe I can multiply them? It works! Finally, success! The bag almost instantly overflows and I pop a small handful in my mouth, satisfied with my handiwork.

Gitty with my newfound success, I see just how far I can take it. I multiply them endlessly. Within a few minutes I have a pile half my height. This is wonderful.  Can I light them up? Hell yes I can. Each gummi bear pulsates individually with a rythmic glow. As the beautiful mound grows to near my height I do the obvious thing: I jump inside. 

As the millions of glowing gummy bears cushion my fall, I half swim, half eat my way to the center. I'm basically hysterical with happiness. I'm laughing so hard that this is happening (and how awesome it is) it's difficult not to choke on the mouthful of gummi bears, not to mention they occasionally lodge in my ear or nose. As I go deeper into the mound I can't tell which way is up or down. The weight is starting to become pressing and it's getting harder to breathe (no thanks to my mouthful of gummi bears.)
I stop swimming and take a second to just chew. I notice the flavor, texture, everything is waayyy too real. These gummi bears are real. This is REAL! I'm going to suffocate by gummi bears. Death by deliciousness! In this brief moment of panic I almost instantly broke the lucidity and I woke up.

Despite the brief panic, I'm going to chalk that up as a win.",0,dream seriously exercise world building elaborate left le exciting stuff anyway funny dream partially lucid aware fun dream last night dream partially lucid meaning awareness dream could control thing kind powerful like hoped fly practicing hour discovered could slowly float learned falling roof could move thing mind cool way thing would wiggle bit hover voila little disappointed determined sun setting decided wonder around city experiment stumbled upon light festival people propelling multi colored brightly lit led like projectile balloon night sky shape animal flower anything imagine cool lit know float around something turn think lit one finger barely stewing useless ability come across snack size packet gummi bear haribo cheer gummi bear anywhere near sufficient one packet hm maybe multiply work finally success bag almost instantly overflow pop small handful mouth satisfied handiwork gitty newfound success see far take multiply endlessly within minute pile half height wonderful light hell yes gummi bear pulsates individually rythmic glow beautiful mound grows near height obvious thing jump inside million glowing gummy bear cushion fall half swim half eat way center basically hysterical happiness laughing hard happening awesome difficult choke mouthful gummi bear mention occasionally lodge ear nose go deeper mound tell way weight starting become pressing getting harder breathe thanks mouthful gummi bear stop swimming take second chew notice flavor texture everything waayyy real gummi bear real real going suffocate gummi bear death deliciousness brief moment panic almost instantly broke lucidity woke despite brief panic going chalk win
441,Had a vivid unsettling dream about the moon,Dreams,"The Moon hungers for the Soul of Man

The dream begins as a collage of a picture a day of my hair growing, before stopping suddenly on a picture of a torso with no head or neck, long thin arms coming out of its shoulders, skin drawn across its pale body.  I look down and realize I’m in an ankle deep stream of blood, the only light is a blood soaked moon high above, massive amounts of blood dropping from the moon, bathing the woods below.  Taking tentative steps forward, the strange creature walks beside me, telling me he is my guide, his voice seeming to come from all around me though he has no voice.  Suddenly it stops, the arm pointing to a dark mountain in the distance, tall and foreboding as he proclaims ‘that is the mountain of sin.’  I ask if that is our destination, he replies that it is not our goal on this day.  

  The blood gets deeper until I’m wading in knee deep currents, the dark woods around me offering no comfort and the blood feeling strangely warm, as if it had just left the body which gave it warmth.  We come upon a cabin, the door open and nothing on the inside, no windows and the door having nothing on the inside to allow one to exit.  The thing tells me this is where I shall find judgement, and stepping up out of the blood I enter the cabin, the door closing shut behind me.  I look around, panicking that there is no way out of the cabin and pound away at the where the door was.  I wait for days, weeks, stuck inside with no way out.  I awake one day as I had all the previous, hungry and afraid.  Standing before me was an identical version of myself, though different somehow.  With a long dark dagger clutched in his hand I ask him what he’s doing here.  He tells me ‘I’m here to feed the moon, it hungers for the soul of man.’  He stabs me through the stomach, then again and again in my torso, I fall down to the ground bleeding, my life leaving my body faster than my blood.  

  My eyes shoot open and I look around, everything as it was during the beginning of my imprisonment in the cabin, my doppelgänger gone, the door cracks open, and I slowly get up and push it open, blood flowing in from higher ground than it had previously flowed from.  Striding out I see my guide, hand pointed towards the mountain once more.  ‘That is the mountain of sin’ he utters with no mouth, his voice everywhere.  Is that our destination I ask, and as an answer he begins walking towards it, I follow after in the blood stream, the moon above glowing brighter than it had before.  A deep bass sounds off in the distance, an unsettling wind following the noise.  The mountain looms before me, the blood lapping at my waist, an abyssal darkness with a plain handle looking to be the gateway into the mountain.  I look to my guide who is turned away from me, his finger pointing towards the moon.  ‘The moon needs fed, it hungers for the soul of man.’  Leaving behind my guide I throw open the gates, nothing but a dark plane lying before me.  Taking a few small steps, the gates creak closed, and I’m left in complete darkness.  

  It’s only moments more until a faint red glow permeates the abyss, my blood soaked legs run towards it, though the closer I get the dimmer the light is.  I reach where I think the light was coming from but it’s gone now, total dark surrounding me once more. I close my eyes and get down on my knees, fear spreading throughout my body.  Opening my eyes everything is covered in an all encompassing swath of red light.  Turning my head around I can see the thing which casts its glow upon the abyss.  A tall, lean man whose body is bare of all distinguishable features stands before me, pale gray skin somehow exudes the red light.  His face has nothing on it, the nose has no nostrils, skin drawn over where eyes should be, with no mouth.  ‘Man deserves not the souls it is gifted, good thing then, that I am hungry.’  His red light gets only brighter and he takes long strides towards me as I back away.  ‘The mountain of Sin stands as a monument to mankind’s evil, and I it’s keeper.’  I’m back outside suddenly, the woods around me cold and the blood seeping up my legs warm.  The red shining down from the moon hurts my eyes.  My guide falls down into the blood, disappearing in its stream, which grows stronger and stronger, taking me into its currents and choking me.",0,vivid unsettling dream moon moon hunger soul man dream begin collage picture day hair growing stopping suddenly picture torso head neck long thin arm coming shoulder skin drawn across pale body look realize ankle deep stream blood light blood soaked moon high massive amount blood dropping moon bathing wood taking tentative step forward strange creature walk beside telling guide voice seeming come around though voice suddenly stop arm pointing dark mountain distance tall foreboding proclaims mountain sin ask destination reply goal day blood get deeper wading knee deep current dark wood around offering comfort blood feeling strangely warm left body gave warmth come upon cabin door open nothing inside window door nothing inside allow one exit thing tell shall find judgement stepping blood enter cabin door closing shut behind look around panicking way cabin pound away door wait day week stuck inside way awake one day previous hungry afraid standing identical version though different somehow long dark dagger clutched hand ask tell feed moon hunger soul man stab stomach torso fall ground bleeding life leaving body faster blood eye shoot open look around everything beginning imprisonment cabin doppelgänger gone door crack open slowly get push open blood flowing higher ground previously flowed striding see guide hand pointed towards mountain mountain sin utters mouth voice everywhere destination ask answer begin walking towards follow blood stream moon glowing brighter deep bass sound distance unsettling wind following noise mountain loom blood lapping waist abyssal darkness plain handle looking gateway mountain look guide turned away finger pointing towards moon moon need fed hunger soul man leaving behind guide throw open gate nothing dark plane lying taking small step gate creak closed left complete darkness moment faint red glow permeates abyss blood soaked leg run towards though closer get dimmer light reach think light coming gone total dark surrounding close eye get knee fear spreading throughout body opening eye everything covered encompassing swath red light turning head around see thing cast glow upon abyss tall lean man whose body bare distinguishable feature stand pale gray skin somehow exudes red light face nothing nose nostril skin drawn eye mouth man deserves soul gifted good thing hungry red light get brighter take long stride towards back away mountain sin stand monument mankind evil keeper back outside suddenly wood around cold blood seeping leg warm red shining moon hurt eye guide fall blood disappearing stream grows stronger stronger taking current choking

In my dream, I was able to fly, I feel lonely and I’m standing outside this field with a HUGE tree and a house, and this kid comes and tells me that our dad has named him (this part is odd because I don’t come from a wealthy family or a brother) the heir to a family fortune. This makes me mad, but not because im losing the money, but because I'm technically the oldest and should be the heir. So I tell the kid that I want to challenge them to some kind of duel like a flying duel, and whoever is able to fly to the top of the tree and back the fastest is the winner and gets the unofficial title of heir. So we’re flying and this tree is HUGE, it’s hundreds  of feet tall and as we’re getting closer to the top, for some reason, I stop flying and start falling. The kid saves me, saying he never wanted my title, and that it has too much responsibility attached to it. As we’re about to land, he drops me by accident, and I fall and land on my feet that causes  my ankle to swell up and the paramedics show up because my dad thought i was going to hurt the kid, but I go to the hospital instead and on my way there, my ankle is still swollen but it doesn't feel as though i landed on it from 50 feet in the air but for some reason i get the feeling thatI’m faking the pain, then I wake up.

454,"I dreamed I had a teenager half-sister and went to meet her... Varied, realistic and strong emotions ensued!",Dreams,"**TL;DR:** I dreamed I had learned about the existence of a half-sister that, apparently, my dad had successfully hid from my mother and I for her entire life. I wish to know what this and my reactions in the dream mean.

IRL I'm the only child of my parents, I'm male and I'm in my mid 30s, married, with no children.

In the dream, as soon as I knew about her I managed to locate her and visited her home. I was already inside her house when she arrived (I know, stalker, much? sorry about that lol). I was super excited about what would come next.

She was opening the front door when she noticed someone was inside and hesitated, so I called her by her name. She asked, ""who's calling me?"" to which I replied, ""It's \[my full name\], your brother"".

After a few seconds she slowly came in, her eyes wide open in disbelief.

""Ohh noes..."" she muttered. I wondered if she knew about me the whole time.

""OH YES!"" I shouted back, and jumped to give her a huge hug.

Still hugging her, I asked her about her age. She told me, but I don't remember exactly. Something between 15 and 20. ""And why haven't I had you in my life until today?"" I asked with a stream of tears rolling down my cheeks.

Then I woke up. I didn't move, and tried to remember every little detail about the dream while crying silently next to my wife. I remember her name (her last name is very unique and doesn't match my family name), her face and hair, the way she was dressed, and especially how she felt during the long hug. But the thing I remember most perfectly is the emotions I felt.

Boy, were those some realistic and strong emotions. I've always wanted to have a sibling and in the dream I felt like it had suddenly become true, so I was overjoyed, but at the same time I was disappointed that we had missed so much time of being together. I was also angry or even resentful at my dad for having kept such a secret from me. And upon waking I was very sad to realise this wasn't real. But what was totally real was my reaction, because that was 100% honest me. My role in the dream was exactly how it would have gone if all of it had really happened.

It was such an emotional rollercoaster that I can't stop thinking about it and it brings tears to my eyes. It was difficult to type all this at work...

When I was about 4 my little sister had died. You don't need to feel bad about it or anything it was a long time ago.

I was actually kind of jealous and lonely, to see my little sister hanging out with some people while I was all alone.

458,Had a dream that my deceased daughter came back to life.,Dreams,"I had a very vivid dream last night that my 5 month old daughter that passed away last March came back to life. To add some sort of backstory, when she was alive she  had been in and out of the hospital for a cyst that was on her brain when she was born. When they drained it, she needed medications to regulate her hormones again. We also found out at around 4 months that she was blind. As I said, she passed away in the night and they were unable to tell me why. Anyway, last night I had a dream that she just appeared one day, alive and healthy. For some reason, in the dream, i remember feeling stressed. I remember thinking about putting my child up for adoption in this dream. I would never do that.  I never even had thoughts like that when she was here. Also, every time I walked away from my daughter she would die again. I remember walking away 3 different times and coming back to a lifeless child. The last time I walked away and came back, she had so many blankets on top of her. I pulled them all off and there was my lifeless baby. She looked the way she did when she first passed away. I’ll never forget how strange she looked to me before I realized that she looked that way because she was dead. I gave her CPR and she puffed up like a balloon and was alive again. I was so happy that I could save her then I woke up. Does anyone have a clue to what any of this means. I don’t feel the same after having this dream.

You can try to fight it by surrounding yourself with love. Your friends, your family, and Christ. Otherwise you’ll end up like him.” She motions to another room in the basement and there is a man there in agony. His spiritual essence is hovering over his body. “He just recently died” she said.

463,"Dreamt about a bunch of weird, seemingly random things?",Dreams,"I took a nap and had the weirdest dream. What could it mean?

I’m walking with a good friend of mine and a teacher keeps coming over, asking us to do a test. I keep saying “oh I can’t, I have to go in a minute but I’ll wait for you (friend)?” 

So we enter the school and a classroom and just as I had said, I leave shortly after. 

I’m now on what looks like a long walk under a huge highway “bridge” if that makes sense. A very big puppy comes up to me and kind of knocks me to the ground but I’m fine until it starts humping my leg. I get pretty mad so the owner gets the dog off. My exact words were “NO. No. I’m not gonna let this happen.” 

Anyway, I’m walking with a friend of mine that I don’t really talk to anymore. I don’t like her very much. She bad mouths another girl who I knew in the dream but can’t place irl. I eventually snapped and we walked our separate ways, now unfriendly towards each other.

It pretty much ends with me running to a big toilet, but then I see a man on the ground. 

Him: “what are you doing in here?”

Me: “uh... I have to pee. This is the women’s bathroom.”

He looked homeless and left. Before I even got to pee, a bunch of people enter too. Adults, teenagers, children, school classes. There’s one woman in the middle talking about something. She asks questions to the crowd around her. One tiny tiny girl takes her hand up and speaks very intelligently. She has the height of a three year old but the woman signals to me that she should be the height of a 9 year old. She also mouths “ I would be proud of her no matter what she looked like.”

The girl walks in circles, talking and talking and getting smaller and smaller. Eventually her face gets red and blue, and she stops talking. The woman picks her up and rocks her from side to side as she dies in her arms.

Apparently she knew the girl was going to die but never when.

Then it’s suddenly a New Years party thrown by the friend I don’t like and I’m trying to find some liquor. I pretty much wake up here.

It felt like I was conscious.

I don't know who this man was, but he kind of looked like me.

It was terrifying how real it felt. I couldn't tell if it was a dream or reality, and during it I was telling myself that I need to call an ambulance and admit myself to a psych ward, but I was too scared to leave my flat, so I was in a sheer panic. I thought it would last forever, but I've just come round and am kind of ""normal"" again now.

466,Dream of an atomic bomb reminiscent of Fallout.,Dreams,"In the beginning of the dream I was looking at people running into a vault. I knew I wasn't allowed in so I wandered off after watching for a bit. I passed a bridge over railroad tracks and came across some people who were in the tracks. We all joined together walking around what seemed to be a rural small town. We did things we wanted to do before dying, and planned on what we would do if we survived the explosion. At one point I saw the image of a girl praying inside a chapel, huge glass windows behind the altar, which the girl was facing. The bomb landed right outside the chapel window, shattering all the glass. The image changed to a group of people outside the chapel, the doors were closed. There was a loud explosion and a cloud of radiation sweeping through everything, destroying the landscape, but not too badly, on hills we could see ahead. As the smoke cloud progressed and where it passed became visible again, along with the mild destruction in it's path, I could see floating demonic red eyes, going slowly away. After this I don't remember much, though I do know it was a long dream, at one point we were at a bar where the bartender was a woman with a raspy voice. I also remember a dog and a lady in a wheelchair at some point. The strangest part of this dream is that I felt like I had seen a trailer of this dream before in my dreams. There were scenes in the dream that I could remember from dreaming about a type of trailer to this dream, the girl praying in front of the glass as the bomb exploded and the glass shattered in her direction was the most notable scene to me.",0,dream atomic bomb reminiscent fallout beginning dream looking people running vault knew allowed wandered watching bit passed bridge railroad track came across people track joined together walking around seemed rural small town thing wanted dying planned would survived explosion one point saw image girl praying inside chapel huge glass window behind altar girl facing bomb landed right outside chapel window shattering glass image changed group people outside chapel door closed loud explosion cloud radiation sweeping everything destroying landscape badly hill could see ahead smoke cloud progressed passed became visible along mild destruction path could see floating demonic red eye going slowly away remember much though know long dream one point bar bartender woman raspy voice also remember dog lady wheelchair point strangest part dream felt like seen trailer dream dream scene dream could remember dreaming type trailer dream girl praying front glass bomb exploded glass shattered direction notable scene
467,Had a very brutal and gory dream after watching a Jacksepteceye let's play before going to sleep,Dreams,"So I was watching Jacksepteceye play a very graphic game about ways to murder a serial killer and it must've stayed in my subconscious. 

First off, I wanna let you know that I don't really remember my dreams after a couple hours so I don't remember the exact details but it went something like this:


the first thing I can remember is me being in a train or a metro and I was being chased by someone. When I turn around to look, it's a friend of mine but and he was dressed up like Michael Gira from the band Swans. My brain probably made this up bc we mostly talk about music. 

So I manage to somehow escape from the subway and get to my home but he's still after me. I get home and go to my room then sit on the floor and put my back against a wall. There's a window right on top of me. All of sudden, he breaks the window and before I can move, he shoots me and I die. 

But then the weirder thing happens. I kinda get put back where I was a couple seconds ago like a checkpoint in a game and I'm not dead yet. So I turn around to the wall and see a little girl standing beside me. When my friend that's trying to kill me breaks the window and puts his inside the house, the little girl takes out a machete and puts it inside his head and just takes the head out of his neck. That shit was so brutal. Like she literally took it out with parts of his throat attached to it like it's no one's business.",0,brutal gory dream watching jacksepteceye let play going sleep watching jacksepteceye play graphic game way murder serial killer must stayed subconscious first wanna let know really remember dream couple hour remember exact detail went something like first thing remember train metro chased someone turn around look friend mine dressed like michael gira band swan brain probably made bc mostly talk music manage somehow escape subway get home still get home go room sit floor put back wall window right top sudden break window move shoot die weirder thing happens kinda get put back couple second ago like checkpoint game dead yet turn around wall see little girl standing beside friend trying kill break window put inside house little girl take machete put inside head take head neck shit brutal like literally took part throat attached like one business

My name is Sarah in this dream. It was like I had just met him, maybe a week in but I was already infatuated. I knew he was married but found it kind of exciting to be his mistress. He told me he wanted something more official with me and we could only achieve it by being honest with his wife. We went to his house and there was a girl a little younger than him named Abbie that he was dating and already lived with them. His wife, Grace, was just arriving shortly after us. He tried to hide me in a bathroom but we knew I would be found. She came swiftly to the bathroom, she was a bit older than us but attractive. She had a gun ready for me when she entered the bathroom, hoping to scare me away, but he was in there with me talking her down. She was angry that he was trying to bring another woman in. She only agreed to allow Abbie on the grounds that she does all of the cleaning and house work, allowing Grace to focus on herself and her career. I couldn’t offer anything like that, I don’t make a lot of money either. I guess my dream was trying to become a wet one because I was really hoping it would turn into a threesom but of course I woke up. 

My boyfriend irl has told me he’s not into swinging or group play, but honestly I’ve always been attracted to sexual deviancy. I love him and have lived with him long enough to say I would be happy for the rest of my life with him, but am I putting my sexuality away too soon? Is this dream telling me I would do anything for him (allow a gun to be pointed at me for a chance to be with him). Is it making me confront 3 faces of my romantic self (the domesticated Abbie, dominating Grace, and sneaky Sarah are all me)?

469,Please help me figure this out,Dreams,"Not sleeping well. Had a dream that I was trying to find my friends new house out in east jesus nowhere and I kept getting stopped by these weird old hillbillies and hoodoo mamas telling me to watch my step before something got attached to me.

She told me they were gone and she didn’t need them because I had shown up “just when I was supposed to” weird but okay. So I pick her up and keep walking, maybe my friend can help.

Finally get to my friends place and he opens the door and screams at the top of his lungs. He throws this huge amulet around my neck and tells me that some fucked up spirits sit waiting in the woods for someone to come along and pity them.

471,My sister and I had the same dream,Dreams,"This happened a few years back. So at the time my sister was away for university and she'd come back home for holidays or long weekends. We do  not watch the same shows or uptake a similar lifestyle. Anyway, i had a dream that it was nighttime. I woke up from my sleep (in my dream) and saw the hallway light on from underneath my bedroom door. I heard my mom and sister saying they needed to stack the boxes high to the ceiling to hide for reasons I dont remember (I believe there was a robber coming or something). I could see the boxes from underneath the door a bit and their shadows. Then I woke up. 
I went downstairs to tell my mom for fun about the dream I just had, and as I'm explaining it my sister ran down the stairs and said ""OMG I had the same dream!"" She said in her dream she was stacking boxes in the hallway with my mom to hide. There was a reason for the box stacking, but I honestly dont remember. I do believe it there was a robber they were aware of. 
Anyway, is this just a coincidence? Has this happened to anyone else? I just find it strange how we were in two different scenes in the dream. I have never run into a situation similar to this dream in real life.

474,Nightmare I just had,Dreams,"This is not the first time I dreamed about criminals. Dreams like this baffle me and I cant say I know why I dream them really.

 

I dreamed about pair of kids. They were a orphan boy and girl. They went on a magical journey in another world together where they met magical creatures and befriended a quirky demon who teased them relentlessly. 

At the end of their journey they returned home. Time passed. Not enough to grow up in any measure of the word but enough for them to get used to the real world again. They missed adventure but not enough to call the demon who teased them so. Thus they chose to have a small one in a near by orchard. 

Something terrible happened in that orchard. They met a group of men and were raped.

When they got back they tried to kill them selves but for some reason they couldn't die. So they decided to call the demon. He came with a smile on his face and asked what they wanted.

The kids told him that he could take whatever he wants as long as he kills those men.

That is when the demon saw thier wrists and as he saw this he could somehow see why. His smile became more plastered. It took a moment for him to answer before he told them ""Ill do it for free."" 

He dissipated.

After a while he returned and took the kids away back to that magical world. At this point the dream shifted to the voice of an old woman playing the narrator and she said, ""And so the hero's and the villian were never seen again."" 

Anyways, that was a wierd one.",0,nightmare first time dreamed criminal dream like baffle cant say know dream really dreamed pair kid orphan boy girl went magical journey another world together met magical creature befriended quirky demon teased relentlessly end journey returned home time passed enough grow measure word enough get used real world missed adventure enough call demon teased thus chose small one near orchard something terrible happened orchard met group men raped got back tried kill self reason die decided call demon came smile face asked wanted kid told could take whatever want long kill men demon saw thier wrist saw could somehow see smile became plastered took moment answer told ill free dissipated returned took kid away back magical world point dream shifted voice old woman playing narrator said hero villian never seen anyways wierd one
475,I had a dream about an amusement park full of dead bodies as animatronics,Dreams,"So basically I was in an amusement park (something that looked like Universal Studios Orlando) with a few family members and we noticed that every once in a while guests would get taken away by security. No one knew what was gonna happen to them, but we knew we wouldn't see them again.
Then my grandpa told me/showed me that all those extremely realistic animatronics in the amusement park were actually the dead bodies of guests in new clothes, with motors so they could move and some recorded sentences they could ""say"".
We got into a less crowded part of the park and it was full of those animatronics. They were everywhere. There was a street that was part of the scenery with some little shops (you couldn't enter them, they were just scenery) and they were full of those animatronics that would act like they were buying things, having a cup of coffee or just talking to other animatronics.
Then suddenly people began chasing us. I don't know if if was security or those animatronics, but if didn't feel good. We ran and tried to hide by going into the buildings but they always managed to find us.

This dream didn't feel like a nightmare, it didn't wake me up (as far as I know) but it feels really weird when I think about it. What does this dream mean? Or does it mean anything at all? I'm really curious.

476,Japanese demon?,Dreams,"Last night I had a weird dream where I was with a group of people then two of my “friends” took off running down a Japanese like scene along a river. I asked them what they were doing and they said “we are going to curse people!” They rounded a corner and as I rounded it the were dipping something in the water and saying something. I backpedaled and took off running in the opposite direction but all the other people disappeared and it got dark. As I passed a statue a female demon jumped on me and held me to the ground and told me that if I got up to run I would have a chance to find the weapon to kill her but if I didn’t find it time she was going to eat my face for the rest of time. I refused to do it and told her to just kill me but she wouldn’t. I began hitting her before I realized it was a dream. I said “this is real I’m leaving...” and she tried to convince me it was real. I finally forced myself to sit up in my bed and woke up from the dream.

477,My dads dream,Dreams,"So my dad had this dream the other day, where there was a cross between an evil clown and one of those wacky inflatable guys they have outside car dealerships. It was across the street and it looked real so my dad motioned towards it and it did the same thing. So he yelled out to it “I know you’re real so if you are give me the winning lotto numbers.”  

So the clown thing then proceeded to give a bunch of numbers and finishes with this evil demon look and says “for those numbers I will now take 10% of yours and your families soul”

What makes this more freaky for me is that when me and my family recently moved into our new house the person living across the road died the night we moved in.

478,A weird dream about a girl,Dreams,"Woke up about an hour ago to a weird dream involving 16 year old me and a girl around the same age ( probably also 16). I have never seen this girl before and I don’t know what the meaning behind this dream js, if there is any meaning at all. 

So the dream started with me getting approached by this girl. And although i vividly remember her face, I knew she was beautiful and she felt like my soul mate. I have never really had a girlfriend since I was 12 so I don’t know if the feeling of overwhelmed joy and excitement is normal or an exaggeration. Most likely normal I’m probably just looking too far into this feeling. Anyway she showed great interest in me and asked me out. I accepted and next thing the I knew for some reason we were booking a flight to Antartica. In my dream Antartica was a lot like Canada and I remember us booking into a cabin in the middle of nowhere. I remember feeling so happy and fulfilled but at the same time I was nervous. I had a feeling of doubt and that she would leave me and I’d be left abandoned. This feeling of abandonment is a feeling I know all to well as I’ve experienced it on multiple occasions. First time being 9 when my mother passed away from cancer. It was a similar feeling and since then I’ve felt it in other dreams too. The most common dream I have is where I’m being left behind after school because I miss the bus and I’m left in am empty, desolate school with nobody in sight. I have that dream probably once every month. It’s a horrible feeling and once i started to feel it in this dream I knew something was wrong. Back to the dream, the sun was setting and we were outside of the log cabin and over looking the ocean with floating icebergs. The sunset with the cold, white snow was beautiful so I took out my phone and told her get close so we can take a selfie of ourselves  with the sunset and ocean behind us. As I went to take the picture I had this overwhelming feeling of doubt and sadness and without warning starting crying real loud into her shoulder. I feel asleep in my dream after that and awoke to being inside the cabin all alone with the girl nowhere in sight. It was nighttime by now and I searched the cabin calling her. I don’t even know if she had a name and I kept saying “sorry” out loud for some reason. Once I realised she was gone I walked outside, got on the ground and started crying with my hands behind my head. It was a feeling of loneliness and hopelessness. The last few seconds of that were bleak but I think i killed myself. 

I awoke with tears on my face and drenched in cold sweat. I really wish I had an explanation for this because it’s one of the worst dreams I’ve ever had and honestly felt so real. It’s hard to explain it but I think I might remember who the girl is. The girl in the dream reminded me of a girl I knew back in year 6. She was always kind to me and I even though she wasn’t one of my closest friends. I had a soft spot for her and really liked her. She left our town back in 2015. She started following me of Instagram last year and yesterday she posted a pic of herself with her boyfriend. I think that might if triggered the dream because the feeling of got from this dream girl reminded me of her.

480,Leading people through the mist,Dreams,"Again I find myself in the mist, walking amongst trees and vegetation similar to what you might find in the wetlands near boreal forest. 

As I traveled through the forest I began to notice people moving with me, spread out in a wide fan behind me, moving at my pace through the trees. None of them seemed focused on me, yet they were clearly following my lead. The sun was just coming over the horizon, we moved east toward it. 

Eventually our procession reached a lake, giving off steam in the cool morning. I heard that I must “strike three” and I knew what I had to do. A storm was brewing in the distance to the southeast. I knew we’d be caught in it but the people trusted me. I’d led them in storms before. We didn’t fear it. 

I fabricated a bridge over the water with my mind and mentally urged the people to hurry across it. Something followed us though the mist. I knew it wouldn’t catch us. As the people crossed, I felt confident.

481,I had the weirdest dream last night.,Dreams,"So my memory of the dream starts with me living with a family. These people are not my real-life family but dream-me knows that they are my adoptive family (which in itself is a bit odd since I'm 27). We all watch the last part of a ring-like horror movie together and then everyone goes about their own business. Pretty soon after I start to feel strange and dream-me knows I'm being possessed by the cursed movie. I find a mirror and I can see dark bags forming under my eyes (I feel them forming too) and my skin looks like cracked porcelain. I go to my dream parents for help, and find out that they get corrupted if I touch them and slowly die...this doesn't alarm dream-me very much though I do try to avoid touching the rest of my dream family. I go through cycles of being possessed and being normal until I eventually do end up touching and killing my entire dream-family. Only after the last of them is dead do I decide to break the cursed movie (it was a DVD) in half, thus freeing myself from the curse. I consider just living in my home with my dead family for a while, but out of the blue an evil priest shows up and starts trying to find me. I decide running is the best option, but not before I sneak around the house collecting my 3DS and all of my pokemon games. Once I have that all in a backpack I make a break for it and run up the street into the town centre. 

Once in the town centre I go into a crappy fast food place and try to get help, but only two people believe my story and agree to come with me to find the airport so I can flee the country. We leave together and that's the last I see of them since the next instant I'm sitting on a plane next to my best friend. She's making conversation with a guy sitting next to her and I join in since they're talking about the food we're having on the plane. Suddenly I realize that the evil priest is sitting next to the guy my friend and I are talking to and I warn them both that the priest is evil. Evil priest then proceeds to pull out a box cutter and stab best friend in the leg, telling her to leave his friend (the guy) alone. The flight attendant comes over at this part and politely asks the evil priest to stop stabbing the other passengers. 

I then look out the window and notice that our plane has turned into a buss and the billboards we're driving past are all sharing the breaking news that a bunch of shiny giratina (pokemon) have been killed in a terrorist attack. We see a giant giratina coming up behind the buss and pull into a strange shelter-like structure to hide from it. At this point evil priest grabs his friend by the hand and they run away. Everyone left on the buss proceed to open pokemon go on their phones and start summoning real-life pokemon to defend us. I spend the rest of the dream flying around on my shiny salamence while my mewtwo defends us (pokemon I actually do have on my pokemon go..strangely my dream version of the app was accurate).

I hope this is the appropriate place to post this but I would love it if someone could shed any light on what I keep experiencing.

Once or twice a year I have this same dream, I used to have it a lot more as a child but even when I have it now I wake up in hot sweats, shaking & not knowing where I am.

In the dream I am laid in a huge bed at the end of a long room facing a huge bay window with long draping blue curtains that are slightly parted. Behind the curtains you can see a bright moon shining through the gap in the curtains. On either sides of the room there's around 6 single beds either side filled with young sleeping children. It feels as though it's an orphanage. At the end of the room there's a red old fashioned see-saw being shined on by the moon. The see-saw slowly starts moving getting faster & faster until it becomes blurry. All of a sudden I hear a scream in my ear then I wake up petrified. I don't know why it scares me so much but I can't make sense of it at all.

488,Lots of death in these dreams lately.,Dreams,"I think my PTSD is acting up again, I've never actually done that much about it. Anyways, so this dream I had last night... Was a little crazy. It started with a car crash that I walked away from, damaged my front right side but killed this lady that had ran a red light into me. I tried to do CPR on her and tried stopping the bleeding but it didn't work. A trooper pronounced her dead when he arrived. I went home and had a drink. 

My friend showed up without a shirt on, covered in blood. I was speechless and I was holding him by the shoulders asking him where he was bleeding from, what happened, etc. He wouldn't speak back to me, well he couldn't really.. eventually I realized that his throat had been slit open when I moved his head up. I also realized his intestines were beginning to fall out of the cut in his neck, idek if that's possible, but I felt them with my hand and tried to push them back in and tried to stop the bleeding again.. but like before, of course, I just had to watch as he died on my floor, gasping for air covered in his own blood and intestines. 

I was freaking out, having a panic attack in my dream at this point. I grabbed my shirt and realized I was still covered in the ladies dry blood from earlier, now mixed with my friends fresh blood all over me too. I woke up after I realized I was covered in their blood..

Edit: I just remembered, after I fell back asleep I had a dream that my three year old nephew fell and split his head open on some stairs while I was babysitting him.

490,Higher Self dream,Dreams,"

During the daytime, I found myself mumbling the words, ""I have been here before, and I know what you are going to do"". I was about to do something and I realized I was living out my past self.


""Thousands of years ago, participation mystique was the basic mode of human mental operation. The boundaries between dreaming and waking were blurred, as they were between different people, and between people and objects. Humanity had a liminal psyche, meaning that its psyche occupied a position at, or on both sides of, a boundary or threshold, blurring distinctions between things.""

First dream scene: ""Fighting with this man""

I am on a pirate-ship-like construction, with free rein to go anywhere.. except there is a shadowy man who is ultimately following me and trying to eliminate me. He wears a black coat.

I look down to the beach, and as I have walked down here.. he is standing facing away from me over down by the water, like he has just got up.

I call out to someone ""allied"" with me: ""betrayal! the attack is on!""

Now we are in fight-or-flight mode. I race it to the nearest stockroom-type structure, looking for bandages. I know if I'm not patched up I can't fight. I'm trying to find something to hold my wrist together.. there is a flesh wound and it's come apart. [note 1] I can only find a small thin spool of sellotape.

I see the other allied man fighting my enemies. I can do nothing.

Dream scene ends.

------------------------


This dream scene begins as I had been walking around a place.. it's hard to describe this place in normal leftbrained terms because it conceptually serves two purposes on the boundary of two dream scenes [note 2]. First, the place becomes an outdoor area I am walking around, looking around: it is a grassy open-plan council estate which has raised platforms: going up towards higher levels where I could supposedly sleep sometimes; second [not ""later""], it is an enmormous open roofed bus shelter and subway. It is the same location, but it can morph between both utilities as needs arise. (This Harry Potter esque quality of it is very hard to explain in left brain terms, but I distinctly remember it being the same place in the dream). On the one hand it's outdoor, on the other hand it's indoor.. and it is also conceptually between destination on the one hand (council estate but not really where you'd want to see yourself living) and travel on the other hand (bus shelter and subway, where you are travelling but not quite moving yet).

I think that I might go and get to one of those upper areas, to see if I can live there.. my mind registers no sense of land ownership, laws or anything like that; I have only curiosity. So, I walk around some pathway with its own little stone staircases and bright green plants to the side; and I am slightly annoyed that I've ended up somewhere else, not able to find a direct route.


------------------------------

Dream scene: ""having fun with people""

I am at a pub/bar, it's lively. The walls are like thick wood from a tree. Everyone is happy.

My cousins are here; it's a big family. Lots of people are sitting around tables on one side of the pub.

I feel hungry so I go to get some food; I stand by the bar and wait. I see an attractive Asian girl in school clothing sitting at a table nearby.

I look in the large mirror behind the bar, and I'm female. I look attractive, with hair that comes down in two short sharp cut bangs around my face; dark brown hair. [note 3]

I look down and I am bare-footed. Someone shouts ""no shoes!"". I feel the weight of this as significant; this, combined with my hunger, is symbolic for something in this situation/scenario being very out of place. I don't feel bad for myself, I am trying to explore and such. I am getting hungry so I ask the bartender for something to eat. I start to go back over towards my family's area at the side of the room near the exit/entrance; I walk back over near where the Asian girl was sitting, deliberately, but she gets up without seeing me before I am near her, and walks off somewhere.

I try to get seated back at the cosy corner, but it's now jam-packed with people and we are literally squeezing past one another to get anywhere. We become stuck in 3-way traffic that is criss-crossing over itself. I am behind one of my cousins going for seconds with his plate, and I beg and plead with him: ""please. I haven't eaten yet"". At the same time I make a T-shape with my knife and fork while locking eyes with him. He seems to be bothered enough by my display.

A short while later it seems the traffic situation has changed. I am going to the other end of the room, just looking for a place to sit down in and hopefully eat, at some point. I make a mental note that I need the table number..

I am seated and I start talking to a distant relative, ""distant"" here meaning someone I rarely ever talk to; a cousin, who happens to be black (in real life, some of my cousins are black). We have this sort of rivalry energy. I end up saying to him all of this:

""There are around 13% of the population who are black, but there are incredibly rich people who have massive portions of wealth, and they are white. What we could do is redistribute the wealth proportional to how many people there actually are.. but I guess that would be socialism! HA!"" - at the same time I close a pamphlet I had brought with me and get on my way. He appreciates my humour and is content with it; we both sense that it's now something he will have to try and outdo.

I start to walk outside of the pub/bar area, into a wider complex; the same as before. It has the look and feel of a British council estate, but more open-plan and spatious with additional levels you can walk stairs up onto (out in the open with no roofs) to presumably live and sleep as you please.

(Boundary between dream scenes)

The council complex area has become a large open, airy bus station and subway station combined, with a roof that is incredibly high and also very wide. I am considering a different way to explore or go home. In my mind's eye I had been looking at a map with North-Eastern destinations right near the coastline, and I have picked one I'm interested in.

My mother appears, with the rest of my immediate close family tagging along, and she informs us we're leaving for a certain destination (a different one than I wanted) and I start to become noticably less lively or present in the moment or happy/joyful. My mother gets one whiff of this and goes on a short display of being in a huff, sulking, in imitation. I start to challenge her and defend myself starting with explaining that I'd wanted to go to a certain place to explore, when suddenly all of this is interrupted by the most strange, odd, unsettling, half-shrieking tone of voice she uses:

""Gerald!--""

My mother has stopped moving behind us, and I get the feeling she has been robbed by someone, so I rush over and feel empathic. However, I notice something is not right.

Somehow our conversation is started over more pleasantly now, as we walk separately from everyone else. I am able to calmly explain to her that I realize she is worried about me and wants to protect me; but that also ""there is another side, truth be told"". I can see in her face contorting that she is not happy with this, but I continue and explain that I am out to explore something new and I have a certain capability within me.

We now arrive at the bus station / subway, as this is the boundary to the next dream scene.

I get on the bus on my own (which is also very similar to a train, with spatious carriages and huge spaces between the seats). I walk over to a carriage with some laughing people on it, and then I sit down away from them near the entrance, smiling to myself. I am happy and content.

I see someone coming towards me - ""oh, hi Toby!"" - I invite him to sit down. (This was Toby from The Office). We start conversation and almost immediately he turns more into an Oscar; a hidden intellectual; also someone with a strong ""cultural"" background which is rather nebulous/vague to me. We somehow get talking again about the 13% versus 1% wealth disparity issue, and I retell it to him. He acknowledges it.

Eventually he tells me about a certain lady who is at our bus's destination, who we are to help for some unexplained reason, and he explains now that I have to say a special word (I presume that this is in her native language) to help her to correct me step-by-step whenever I can't do something right. He says the word is ""Luuiliam"". I try to pronounce it -- murky as it first sounds to me -- ""Luuulam"". I am skipping part at the end of it. He corrects it for me -- ""Luuiliam"" -- and I see the letters appear spelled out correctly in front of me. I struggle but seem to get it right this time.

We arrive at our destination, but for some reason he has become angry with me, he has become cold and won't open up. He starts muttering something under his breath, about how I don't need to help the lady. I distinctly remember watching his lips, with a sense that I am not welcome.

I look around to the supermarket behind me, and I see the green branded supermarket signage that makes the room feel very ""supermarket""-like. (There's always lights on, isn't there? And it's kind of barren in a way).

I turn back to my other side and I am magically at the exact right position to be at the checkout, with this woman who is dressed in strange tattered rags and a head wrap, and with the man from the bus. He looks at me blankly, saying nothing, then picks the woman's shopping and puts it next to her on the other side of the checkout. He is standing behind there, with her while I am on the other side. I go to pick up something to help the woman (I assume she can't do it on her own), and the man vanishes completely. I am shocked at his disappearance. The woman seems to be smiling and waiting patiently, doing nothing. I decide to persist and move some food items for her. I put some unwrapped bare chicken breast pieces on the smooth metal counter by her. Then I am placing on some pickled beetroot in a jar.. some more chicken (they are roughly cut, large shredded pieces) around it, almost by mistake. To my horror, the beetroot juice comes out of the jar and spills around the chicken, ruining it and making it appear like a bloodstained buzzsaw blade. I have completely messed up. I am totally distraught at this point, beside myself and in some sort of abstract pain. I put my hands on my face like I'm about to cry, and my face certainly has that expression on it, but I don't. I am extremely upset.

My mother suddenly appears from my side - ""we followed you when you left [on the bus]; we tend to keep an eye out on our family"".

Dream scene ends.

------------------------------------

What does the dream mean? Let's examine further and I will sum it up at the bottom.

------------------------------------


note 1:

In real life I have a mark on my wrist where I cut myself due to extreme stress. I cut myself with an industrial circular saw.


note 2:

This takes some explaining: the right brain is conceptual in a different way to the left, in that the left brain always wants to concretize everything and make its details certain (think boat building and engineering), whereas the right hemisphere can tolerate chaos and imprecise yet vivid definitions (abstract concepts). Intuitions, the unspoken insights behind our greatest discoveries and which we can never quite put into a description, and which we get instantly - are grasped by the right brain in the unconscious.


note 3:

I am male and usually think of myself as male while awake, but in dreams I rarely see my own body or have much sense of interacting with others at all. I know that rationality and intuition are genderless, so it makes more sense to me that my right brain and my Higher Self have no ""gender"". I was recently scouring someone's reddit posts and they reminded me strongly of a genderless impressive personality: some high amount of reasonable, gifted insight that I couldn't ever see in these comments was either male or female. It was like trying to find a needle in a haystack. Since then, it has recently occurred to me sometimes that I in myself am not only masculine but also feminine (Jung's psychology and alchemy book illustrates this area by making it clear that we all need to individuate both aspects into our personalities, as well as the Higher Self, so we are free from chasing anything that we lack in ourselves).


-----------------------


The dream's message is that ""this isn't for pleasing people"" (myself; my personality). As we get deeper into the dream, my commitments in engaging with other people get deeper and deeper, more and more ***disingenuous***, from the initial starting point of dialectical clashes of honesty (fighting and disagreement) to its polar opposite of meaningless busywork and toil that I didn't care for and which nobody asked for. Bare-footed = unprepared. I am ""exploring new lands"" but without genuine purpose. This is clearly then a problem that my waking self suffers from. I don't know where to draw the line. I don't organize myself. My Higher Self is messaging me some things that dovetail with my left brained, conscious inner work (individuation).

The ""wound"" on my wrist is symbolic for losing my sense of true self. If I am fighting my Jungian Shadow, then to become/embody less of him, I must stay my true self, separate from other people. This is the meaning of bandaging myself separately before I ""mix"" with someone even ""close"" to me. This has to do with my spiritual work on separating the massive flood of thoughts I can have about other peoples' lives in the world, with my own recognition that reality is based on mathematical waves and hence, whatever happens in one instance has no particular final bearing or ""stain"" on my own life or how I should feel -- how it should affect how I behave or live. I should instead live for myself, as needs must and as reason would otherwise dictate. I should be unaffected by the ***appearance*** of things, the ***being***, and focus also on the ***becoming*** aspect of reality & the collective.

The consistent threading theme we are seeing all the way through here, is the Higher Self (a component of the psyche which Jung was aware of) attempting to lift and elevate the waking self away from the trappings of its lower bindings (the realm of appearances; the ingrained ways we think; the ways we waste time or get things wrong). The right brain's special functioning here during dreams, has a purpose in trying to communicate with the left hemisphere of the brain to draw attention to a broader perspective, which -- unlike the left brain's concreteness and certainty -- is highly abstract, chaotic, contradictory and formed in a very different way.

""Luuiliam"" is very similar to the name of someone I dated, and if she was much older, then she would have resembled the gypsy woman in the dream. I was trying to help her, but I don't know why. This brings a lot of clarity to it for me, as I'd been having trouble getting over her. The dream posits perfectly that she is someone who would otherwise (in other ""skin"" or circumstances) be unknowable to me. That is a very striking thought indeed.

The right brain can help individuate how we think, away from its particular left brained pitfalls. The right brain is offering its assessments of where we keep making repeated, particular, knowable/intelligible failures (drawn up inaccuracies). This dialectical synthesis is to say that we are trying to combine both brain hemispheres so as to escape the limitations of both individual hemispheres on their own (and the suspiciously habitual mistakes that are to do with how one particular brain hemisphere is organized). To the right brain, you can have highly abstract vision with minimal detail filled out. The left brain is quite the reverse, seeking to hammer concreteness out of its concepts and mental content. Both of these approaches need to be respected, in all domains of life.

My dream last night involved my mother discovering I smoked cannabis and was disappointed in me.  She said it was why I was hearing voices.  

At first I acknowledged my dreams are dreams but it seems to be reoccurring and I’m now developing a fear of being psychotic.  Can anyone shed light into why I may be having these specific dreams?

492,My friend the serial killer,Dreams,"Weird dream I had a little while ago.

So I had a friend who was a serial killer, we all knew about it (group of friends) and we didn't really mind it. It was kind of interesting sometimes, you never knew when he would just flip out and just kill some random guy in front of us. I must admit that the first time it was incredibly grotesque, but we got used to it. Just as long as we don't get any blood on us it's fine. Generally he's very careful when he performs a murder, he's careful about cameras, other people, neighborhood, cops and all that. Just a couple of time we've had to help him.
I remember the last time we were in a bank, I don't know why it was open after 5, but anyways we were in there. It was empty except for us and a clerk. He saw the clerk and just jumped at him and killed him.. What and idiot- I thought - now we've got to get rid of the security footage. He went into the bathroom to clean himself while we handled the video cameras. The clerk was just lying there on the floor, lifeless in a pool of blood. Not even 5 minutes later a couple of guys came in looking for the clerk. They saw him on the floor and they saw us with the security tapes. Unfortunately they were friends with the dead guy, and pulled out some (knives I think) weapons? We ran as fast as we could into a room with a lot of columns and I hid wherever I could. The idiot was still in the bathroom! Why didn't he hear us scream and come help us? The two guys past beside me without looking and killed the rest of my friends, but when I thought I was safe and tried to sneak out, someone grab me by the arm and said, where do you think you're going?",0,friend serial killer weird dream little ago friend serial killer knew group friend really mind kind interesting sometimes never knew would flip kill random guy front u must admit first time incredibly grotesque got used long get blood u fine generally careful performs murder careful camera people neighborhood cop couple time help remember last time bank know open anyways empty except u clerk saw clerk jumped killed idiot thought got get rid security footage went bathroom clean handled video camera clerk lying floor lifeless pool blood even minute later couple guy came looking clerk saw floor saw u security tape unfortunately friend dead guy pulled knife think weapon ran fast could room lot column hid wherever could idiot still bathroom hear u scream come help u two guy past beside without looking killed rest friend thought safe tried sneak someone grab arm said think going

What I do is I walk on a white marble of grid tiles after parking my car in the parking garage and taking the elevator to this along open space of this secret floor.

494,My weird disaster murder dream,Dreams,"Before I get into it I do want to put a trigger warning about my dream, mostly because there was a corpse. The corpse wasn't based on reality, however, the situation surrounding it along with its condition were both very disturbing (to me at least). So here's the warning, be warned! 


My dream started in Minecraft, as silly as it sounds. I don't remember much of how it started, but there was a strong feeling of dread. 2 other people we're playing with me, and one of them was planning to do something horrible. He refused to tell me what he planned but said I could watch if I wanted. 


I went to the area they were in, and it started almost immediately. It was on a level with a natural disaster, with blocks beginning to break off buildings and forming a tornado. There was also lava, which seemed to be rising with every second. It became clear to me at this point that the ""revenge"" or ""prank"" the one guy had planned had gotten out of his control, as he was terrified. 


I started running up a hill in an attempt to escape the lava, but suddenly there was lava flowing from the top of the hill and I had no place to turn. In a last-ditch effort, I tried throwing an ender pearl in a random direction, only to end up in lava anyway. 


Then the dream suddenly changed to a real-world setting. Here, I was friends with a Man. I knew he had done something wrong, horribly wrong to someone young and close to me (I will refer to them as the Kid). I was worried and looking for the Kid. I remember the Man kept cooking for me, and I kept setting it to the side. At one point, the Man had made me scrambled eggs.


 Eventually, I found the Kid. He was dead, which wasn't surprising to me in the dream but I was still sad and horrified by it. The Kid had been shoved in a closet and burnt to the point of being unrecognizable, but somehow in the dream, I knew it was him. I was about to run, to find a way out of the house and away from the Man that did this, when I saw the scrambled eggs again. It had the Kid's finger in it.

496,God looks like Anthony Hopkins,Dreams,"I had a couple years ago with a guy in it who looked like Anthony Hopkins in a white fedora, Hawaiian shirt, white shorts, and sandles, but he sounded like Hopkins and Morgan Freeman speaking at exactly the same time. We were sitting at a table outside a Cafe in what resembled Italy. It almost felt like a scene out of Inception.

Me: who are you supposed to be, God?

H/F: Is that what you want me to be? Truthfully, I am merely a figment of your imagination. And a representation of your subconscious mind.

Me: why do you sound like Anthony Hopkins and Morgan Freeman talking at exactly the same time?

H/F: that is unimportant, this is simply the form you have chosen. You are dreaming. I am here to show you this place can be whatever you want it to be; because you are now aware of it, you can shape it to your desires.

Me: whatever I want?

H/F: indeed. Whatever you want it to be, it will be.

Me: I want Chinese food.

I'm serious, this is how it went. He said, ""ok,"" we got up and walked across the street to a mom & pop Chinese takeout complete with steam tables of food. Anthony Freeman bid me goodbye and good luck, and I started for the food. I chose sweet & sour chicken, orange chicken, pork fried rice, beef & broccoli, and water--why water? Because I knew I wouldn't be able to taste or feel it. I _could_ taste the sweet & sour chicken, but I didn't feel the food in my mouth and the water felt like nothing, which is normal for me. I've never seen the Hopkins Freeman man again in any other dream.

One of my tells that switches a dream to lucid is drinking water. I can't feel it, or taste it, drinking water in a dream for me has zero sensation, and I instantly realize I'm dreaming and go lucid from that point.

498,Something scarier than a nightmare,Dreams,"I haven't sorted it all out so my post is messy. I apologize for that

So I fell asleep last night and saw a dream... It was realistic enough to make me scared. It's so realistic maybe it's worse than a nightmare.

I was filling up a survey called ""**For Children: Emotional or Physical Abuse by Your Parents**"". And I was writing the exact things that my father had ever done to me in English(Even though it's not my mother tongue). Of course it's a dream, so I never intended anything but I was writing things honestly and graphically, that made the dream even scarier.

What's more, these are real. I guess my mind has finally admitted that my father has abused me. Because this isn't a support subreddit I won't go any further about this topic. Well, I'll talk about the sequence in my dream again. Then my father caught me answering the sheet and even though nobody in my family but me understands English he guessed what I was writing, so he got mad and started to chase me. I ran as fast as I could and I finally hid from my father but I still had fears of getting caught again and then I broke down into tears.

Then I woke up.

I hope it never happens again to me.",0,something scarier nightmare sorted post messy apologize fell asleep last night saw dream realistic enough make scared realistic maybe worse nightmare filling survey called child emotional physical abuse parent writing exact thing father ever done english even though mother tongue course dream never intended anything writing thing honestly graphically made dream even scarier real guess mind finally admitted father abused support subreddit go topic well talk sequence dream father caught answering sheet even though nobody family understands english guessed writing got mad started chase ran fast could finally hid father still fear getting caught broke tear woke hope never happens

501,First ever lucid dream,Dreams,"Just had my first lucid dream the other night that felt so strange I just wanted to share.

The dream started off quite simple. I saw myself laying in bed, however it was in my old room in my old house. Then all of a sudden it's like I was jolted into my own body, my eyes opened yet I couldn't move and it felt like my entire body was numb. First panic hit, but then I steadied my breathing and the sensation began to subside. I was now in control, I could see, sense and feel everything within the dream world. However I felt extremely weak, as if my muscles were drained from fighting off the paralysis. I've had sleep paralysis when waking up before, but never inside a dream.

I then proceeded to stumble out of my room, leaning against the wall to keep balanced, everything looked familiar yet slightly different. Family photos on the wall almost identical yet small differences(hair styles, clothes etc) I eventually got into the family room where I saw my  mother and sister talking. They asked me if everything was alright, so I then explained what was going on. They just smiled and said I must have had an interesting dream. But I continued to insist that this was the dream and that where I'm from i dont live here anymore and my sister hasn't been around for years.

It was then at that point right as my sister was about to speak that everything froze. Then from seemingly nowhere all I heard was ""You're not supposed to be here"" Not in a threatening tone, more so like it was curious.Then I blinked and all of a sudden was awake in my real bed and house. Like no time had passed and without the feeling of just waking up or being jolted out of a dream.

Just felt like sharing that for whatever reason. Totally felt like I spent a bit of time in an alternate reality lol.",0,first ever lucid dream first lucid dream night felt strange wanted share dream started quite simple saw laying bed however old room old house sudden like jolted body eye opened yet move felt like entire body numb first panic hit steadied breathing sensation began subside control could see sense feel everything within dream world however felt extremely weak muscle drained fighting paralysis sleep paralysis waking never inside dream proceeded stumble room leaning wall keep balanced everything looked familiar yet slightly different family photo wall almost identical yet small difference hair style clothes etc eventually got family room saw mother sister talking asked everything alright explained going smiled said must interesting dream continued insist dream dont live anymore sister around year point right sister speak everything froze seemingly nowhere heard supposed threatening tone like curious blinked sudden awake real bed house like time passed without feeling waking jolted dream felt like sharing whatever reason totally felt like spent bit time alternate reality lol

507,Sometimes my dreams are just completely messed up.,Dreams,"A few days ago, I had a brief dream in which I saw a couple with their newborn child. I wasnt actually there, it felt like I was simply watching, as if it was something on TV. The woman had the baby in her arms, and both the man and woman were just looking at the baby with smiles on their faces. Then, out of nowhere, an explosion happened. The three of them remained stationary in the same spot, and weren't moved by the explosion, but their skin was mostly burned off. The husband fell to the ground, apparently dead. The woman, who still had the baby in her arms, was missing all the skin on her hands and arms, and her face was burned and melted, and her eyes were gone. The baby was burned to a crisp, and its head just kinda popped off and blood squirted from its neck hole. The woman couldnt see the baby, but she felt around its body and noticed that its head was missing and that it had died. She was overcome with grief, dropped the baby, and then twisted and pulled her own head off before falling to the ground dead. 

After this, I shifted into another dream. I cant remember much of the second dream, but when I awoke, this first dream was burned into my memory. It was horrific and very worrying.

509,Frequent Bizarre/Almost Lucid Feeling dreams?,Dreams,"When other people talk about weird dreams, typically they say things like ""I had a dream I made out with my sister"" or ""I had a dream that I was giving a speech and realized I was in my underwear and then my teeth fell out."" This isn't what I mean by frequent ""bizarre"" dreams. At least once or twice a week I have extremely vivid, narrative dreams. I'll give you some examples from my dream journal:

*The sky was greyish and everything had a kind of dark feel to it, dead trees etc. I knew I was trying to break three girls out of a prison that was guarded by heavily armed muscular clowns/jesters. The prison was on an island that you could only reach by rope bridge, which I crossed and cut through the fence with some boltcutters to free them. We were chased by the clown guards until we reached a city that had a low-poly (Think PS1 style game) feel to it, and it was inhabited only by children. The alleyways were mazelike, and we ended up being chased by a Minotaur through the alleyways until we were able to hide in a house and he couldn't get his horns through the doorway.*

**Or another example:**

*I was in a place that I somehow knew was Israel, where I met up with a childhood friend who told me he had retired from the army and was there to help them deal with a dinosaur invasion. We got split up when a dragonlike dinosaur attacked us, and I ran into a bombed out building where a beautiful woman tried to seduce me only to reveal she was a shapeshifting dinosaur. So I ran to the sea and got on a surfboard and paddled out into the ocean before I came to a giant earthen dam and met with other surfing survivors of the dinosaur attack who were watching a movie on a big projector screen over the dam from their surfboards in the water. We were attacked again by dinosaurs so we got over the dam and paddled further out before I got lost and ended up floating to a place called ""San Marcos"" which was full of Maori looking people. A family there took me in, and their father was a dead ringer for David Duchovney and his first name was David. I told them about the dinosaur attack and they said they would be my new family since my old one had been killed. We went around the island of San Marcos doing various errands like getting groceries and going to the barbershop. Over the course of events I fell in love with the daughter of the family and the dream ended with me getting my head shaved in the barbershop after David told me I could only see his daughter if I was bald.*

So yeah, and there are many more like that. I've only kept a dream journal for the past year or so, so I've forgotten the details of a lot of the older ones. I have shared my dreams elsewhere and people have asked me what I'm on or how I have such vivid dreams and I don't really know what to say. I don't take illegal drugs or any medications, I rarely drink alcohol, and I wouldn't say I am particularly stressed plus I've had dreams like this my whole life. Does anyone else have naturally extremely vivid dreams with such bizarre content? Is there a cause? My mother has similarly vivid dreams so maybe its a genetic thing?

510,Who are you? I know you!,Dreams,"So I met my second husband in 1995. We had been dating about six months and one night while staying over at his place I had the first of many similar dreams. I dreamt he and I were driving home from dinner and he pulls over and holds my hand, says he loves me and starts to kiss me. When the kiss ends and he pulls back, it is someone else. I ask who are you? I think I know you. I look towards the  windshield and we are in a large red truck. My bf drove a blue Toyota Tacoma and that's what we had started out riding in in the beginning of the dream. He looks at me and smiles in a way that says, duh, you should know me! He then says I'm your Husband! I said no you're not, I'm not married. He just kept repeating that he was my husband. I woke up, thought it was odd, but felt so strange, like I knew this person. I'll try to shorten a long story. My bf and I later marry and have two sons. I continue to dream of this man to this day, even after 23 years! Even though I KNOW I see his face in my dreams, I can never remember what he looks like. But he always says he is my husband and I know that we love one another very much! I always wake up so sad, but confused wondering who it is. Let me just clarify, it is not my ex husband, or an ex boyfriend. There are no lingering feelings there for anyone from my past. Don't ask me how I know? I couldn't tell you. I just know that I do. I'm sorry this is so long, but I just wanted to get it off my chest and out there, because it has been going on for so long and it's frustrating! Thanks for letting me post.

515,Maybe a pact with the devil?,Dreams,"So it starts normal with me getting comfy in my bet. It was a normal summer day, sleepin in my room. In the dream, there was a creature that was sitting on a chair in my room. At some point I asked it what was he doing here. It stood up and everything startrd burning. My room transformed itself in hell (the generic image with a burning cave). Now with the fire all around, the creature had horns, goat legs and a muscular human torso. His voice was deep and raspy. He began speaking to me something that I can't remember but was very important. It was a question of yes or no. Also when he was speaking, there was a very eary noise of people screaming in agony, rusted metal being scratched and many other strange noises. Despite this, I wasn't scared at all, and was very happy seeing him, that made him visibly glad. Now the curious part. I answeared with a confident ""yes"", everyting stoped, the fire the noise and him.
The thing transformed into a suited man with a goaty holding a contract in his hand, that I signed.
He put it into the suitcase. Told me ""Thank you for your cooperation and we will meet when it is time to meet. And then he left through the door.

Normally, I would belive it's a bad dream, but I woke up covered in sweat in a cold room in the middle of summer with a feeling that something important really happened.

516,Spectral birds and ancient dance,Dreams,"I often have epic dreams. Very involved. To the point that I get disappointed upon waking that they aren’t real. I want to remember these dreams in detail to use them somehow in drawing or story telling. They cling to my waking life and I’ve actually avoided major bad shit from happening by following some sense in them. After waking I try to get as much out as I can and often forget that I have them until reading over them later. I’m sure many here do the same. This is one of the most recent:
     I was telling my mom how I’ve been waking up unable to sleep lately. She’s telling me that we take the burden of responsibility hard. That’s why. We can’t shut it down. Go through this back yard. And some point I’m on this train. With this weird crew. Three people. A girl and a boy. There’s a bed in the middle. They’re asking where I’m going to
Sit. Weird animals. This guy I’m with is hypnotizing these birds. They just freeze mid air and then shoot off into this corner. Flatulating. There is a boy in the corner. There is a feral child there that can’t speak English. Is learning. I go to leave and try to figure out where I am. There is this man in the front room. I’m walking through this water and these bugs are attaching to me. At my feet. I climb down this railing the ceiling gives way everyone laughs. I ask this guy where I’m at. That I can’t remember where I am. That I just woke up here. Hes using sign language at me very forcefully repeatedly then as I repeat him and try to remember for a later translation he becomes more and more soulful. And starts this Indian traditional dance. And I’m basically just mesmerized and understanding him though this dance. Then he has others show up and dance around me. The feeling is so intensely spiritual that I can hardly take it. There are all sorts of cars. At one point someone asks me if they are Stanly’s cars. Art car type stuff. This couple stops me at this mall and asks me for directions I tell them I don’t know where they’re at. Some guy tries to get into my wallet. And makes fun of the bag of food I have that starts spilling its contents. I tell him that it’s the hardest and most tasty thing I’ve ever eaten. I fall next to Fariha and decide I’m going to lay there with her. All of these people have this frog like pattern on legs. And she’s like going to be my girlfriend now. She’s looking for jobs that have to do with underwater exploration.

519,The Horror Maze,Dreams,"This is a dream I had exactly ten years ago that has stood out to me, I'd love to hear everyone's input/thoughts on it. But please be warned, it's very long (and downright ridiculous in parts). I have a lot of 'out there' dreams quite often, and I usually just figure it's from being a gamer/writer. 

&#x200B;

**TL;DR**: A high ranked angel with two giant wolves kicked monster butt and whenever I'd get spooked, I'd feel better thinking about those wolves. 

The dream started out with me going to what I thought was a haunted house with one of my internet buddies that I'd met on Gaia Online. We were there with different groups of people wandering around this warped maze and had no clue about the dangers within it. When we heard people screaming in terror, we just rolled our eyes and joked about it (cause irl, we are pretty hard to scare), unknowing to the fact that they were actual screams of pain. It wasn't until we got further into the maze and started feeling *off* that we realized something was wrong. When we passed by a group on the opposite hedge from us, their screams warped into a guttural snarl. I remember looking at my friend, about to voice my concerns when I noticed his features looked like they were beginning to darken and twist into something not human. Almost like something was trying to possess him. Little did we know, all around us, the visitors to that maze were transforming into monsters/demons all around us. Right when I was about to ask if he was alright, Freddy Krueger comes around the corner and starts smack talking us.

Now, let me just mention a little fun fact here before I continue. I have always loved Mr. Krueger. As corny as the nightmare movies were, he just never scared me, even as a kid. Heck, I've always thought Robert Englund was a handsome man either way, and I'd dreamed of Freddy in the past...and whenever he'd try to scare me or threaten me, I'd always laughed at him. 

Getting back to the dream, I had rolled my eyes and laughed at him when he insulted us, but he suddenly transformed into a beefy soldier (who resembled Chris Redfield a GREAT deal; it was around the time RE5 came out and I was playing it a lot) who suddenly had a machine gun in tow. I had an 'OShi--' moment and tackled my friend into a conveniently out of placed closet and slammed the door closed. Freddy Soldier proceeded to open fire on the hedge closet, cackling like a madman the whole time. Now, naturally a closet door wouldn't stand a chance and would be torn to shreds. But this one? It just had scattered holes punched through it. As dust was settling, I heard two howls simultaneously break the silence. A bright light all but erupted from the closet, causing Soldier Freddy to shield his gaze as two magnificent white wolves burst out from inside and charged past him. They proceeded to run throughout the entire maze, darting by every single person whom had become possessed and 'cleansed' every last one of them. 

&#x200B;

When Krueger lowered his arm and looked at the closet, an angel emerged from within. (I'm still unclear if she was a guardian, or if it was me) She had somewhat short hair that appeared silver/white but glinted with a rainbow of color in the brilliant light she radiated. She wore elegant gloves that reached up past her elbows and had feathers adorning their sides and a gorgeous gown/sash made of silk or satin ribbons. Her legs were adorned with stockings that reached up to her calves but exposed her feet, wrapping around beneath the heel of them. Her eyes were the the lightest shade of blue and turned as dark as the ocean when she stared down Krueger and her many wings were a large, flowing trail of feathers behind her that stretched out to their full extent and length as she turned to watch her two wolf companions return to her side. They both had long, bushy tails and coats of pure soft silver and they too emitted the same strange light\~aura she did. Freddy was about to unleash bullet hell on her and  all she did was wave her arm and he straight up vanished. When she turned back to the closet to check on my friend, it wasn't him who emerged. It was someone in a mecha suit that looked a lot like Zero from Megaman (my friend LOVED the franchise and Zero was his favorite character). Determined to banish the darkness from him, the two began to square off against one another. Mecha Zero blasted the Seraphic entity with two guns and she 'aimed' her wings at him and feathers shot out and lodged into his suit, like long arrows. 

I woke up before I could see the outcome of the dream. But what I took away from it was that I'd always think of those two wolves whenever I was ghost hunting with friends or just scared by something in general. I felt like they protected/watched over me. I even named them, but I read years ago that you should never name spirits for they might be offended, especially if they already have names. I haven't' felt their presence in quite a few years now, but I think that's because I fell out of touch with my spiritual self. 

Long story short, I have a wild imagination that likely stems from too many video games/anime and all that other good stuff.

522,Dreaming of a dead acquaintance,Dreams,"I'd like to start off by stating that i am not really a religious man. Im not an athiest, but im skeptical of everything in life, including religion and non religion, if you will. That being said....

I had a dream i was attending a low budget college and several classmates of mine were there. Kids from all of my childhood. We were in a cafeteria getting some drinking fountain soft drinks when all of a sudden, I see a kid I would talk to every now and then named Charlie.( Now let me shift back to real life. Charlie was an easy going kid who hung out with some burnouts, but he was a reliable kid and most people didn't have a bad thing to say about him other than maybe he was non-ambitious. I knew him since i was about 8 or 9. I am 27 now. In 2014, he was stabbed to death by a methhead who was dating his mom. The methhead also tried to kill Charlie's mom and his sister and then tried to kill himself. They all survived, except Charlie. It was really tragic in our hometown and exteemely saddening to his close friends.) 

Now back to the dream. I see Charlie and I immediately become filled with joy, like I hadn't seen him in a long time and something in the back of my dream-filled mind lets me know that he is actually dead. Everyone around him is so happy to see him. I decided to give him a full on man hug. Now, this is where I experienced something i never have before. Immediately after I hug him, i get this amazing, indescribable feeling. My vision changed to the purest, golden light that can only be described as the most comfortable, perfect feeling anyone could probably have. (Similar to having a perfect psychedlic drug experience, but way better) It felt so positive and right. I think Charlie spoke to me, but i can't really recall anything as far as words or subject matter. Don't really remember much at all after that. Just remember waking up and feeling like i had been positively changed or positively traumatized, if that makes sense. 

Was this a real connection to the afterlife? Idk. I have never experienced or even tried to experience anything like that before. 

Anyone else had something similar?",0,dreaming dead acquaintance like start stating really religious man im athiest im skeptical everything life including religion non religion said dream attending low budget college several classmate mine kid childhood cafeteria getting drinking fountain soft drink sudden see kid would talk every named charlie let shift back real life charlie easy going kid hung burnouts reliable kid people bad thing say maybe non ambitious knew since stabbed death methhead dating mom methhead also tried kill charlie mom sister tried kill survived except charlie really tragic hometown exteemely saddening close friend back dream see charlie immediately become filled joy like seen long time something back dream filled mind let know actually dead everyone around happy see decided give full man hug experienced something never immediately hug get amazing indescribable feeling vision changed purest golden light described comfortable perfect feeling anyone could probably similar perfect psychedlic drug experience way better felt positive right think charlie spoke really recall anything far word subject matter really remember much remember waking feeling like positively changed positively traumatized make sense real connection afterlife idk never experienced even tried experience anything like anyone else something similar

525,I had a dream about me killing milions of people a few days ago,Dreams,"So i had this dream, it started with me waking up in some kind of a cell, and someone was knocking on my doors. When i opened the doors i saw a soldier who said to me ""Its time for you do do your job"" and he told me to follow him. We were walking trough some halls, they were clean and made out of metal and to me they seemed like those halls of an underground bunker, the hall was so long that i could not see its end, we passed next to a few doors and windows while walking. The colors of the hall were greyish but i could see all the bright colours trough the windows

After a long walk he stopped in front of some big doors and told me ""The battle is over"" and the doors opened. The room that i walked in had very high ceilings and the walls had been covered with monitors, it looked somewhat like an airport control room but bigger and with more people

On the monitors i could see a list of strategic and civilian targets and a lot of world maps

The soldier led me to my table, that was in middle of the whole room and told me to press the button on the table. Everyone in the room started looking at me and then i realised that i am about to launch a nuclear missile. I was thinking to myself that i had no options, so i pressed the button. The moment i did that everything started shaking and over all monitors i could see the destruction i brought upon humanity, all the explosions and deaths. I remember that one of monitors was showing text that said ""NUMBER OF DEATHS"" when i pressed the button the numbers have gone insane (i also remember seeing a number thats way biigger than there are people on earth, but thats a dream anyways)

I started crying while the world was dying and remembering all my friends, i had also screamed a lot of things (including the name of my sister, mom and dad and the name of my ex gf, and that i am sorry for what had happened)

I woke up and ran to the window and realised it was all a dream

I remember seeing a long row of opened mailboxes, and I open mine. A small envlope with a thin 5cm black syringe with a cap, and a card attached. I had already accepted the meaning of the situation, but I read the card anyways and it quoted something from the bible. Something I deeply feared yet understood. So I sprayed the poison unto my hand to examine, and I did see the name of the drug, though I had forgotten. It had started with a C and it was a green paint-like substance. I was intensely scared of this position.

I am not entirely sure why, but I had a sort of conviction to carry through. I injected it and I knew it was suppose to provide a painless death. After the injection I began walking and no one was to be seen, I was hallucinating and suddenly felt very apologetic and guilt in which I did not want to leave

532,I predicted my Great Uncles death.,Dreams,"I was about 15 (05-06) when i had a dream...
I was standing in a big garage like room, with long tables full of faceless people. I turned around and i saw my great uncle B and my grandfather. So I've gathered the people in this room are all dead. I sit with them and start eating and visiting. I look to my other side and i see my great uncle J... Just eating quietly. These two are my grandfather's brothers so you have a guess at the age group. 
The next day, i called someone who would listen and not pass judgement. I called my grandfather's favorite cousin V. I told her about the dream..
V: So what are you thinking?
Me: Honestly? I think J is next. 
V: what do you mean?
Me: Not like next in the family but...next of grandpa's siblings.
V:...
Me: i don't know how, but i think he's next. Please, if you can, keep an eye on him.
V: I'll do my best but if he leaves the state again thats going to be hard. 

Usually when i have a dream that i really feel is prophetic and i tell someone...it doesn't happen, but if i keep it to myself it happens. Damned if i do, damned if i don't.
 
But over the next several years none of my greats had died.

Summer 2012 I'm on the phone with my great aunt L, we were pretty close, and she tells me that V is in the early stages of dementia. My thoughts: great...the one person who knows is slowly going off the deep end. (I'm really fond of my cousin V even though the last update i got was 2 years ago and she's probably passed by now so dont get me wrong.) I then tell aunt L since we're talking about V. And i tell mom who of course cant do a damn thing except listen but i feel like someone has to know.

Winter 2012 i get a text from my brother
 Call dad.
 I call dad.
 ""Uncle J died this morning."" 
I'm standing next to my then boyfriend and i fall apart...aside from grief, im feeling an inaccurate sense of guilt because, mother f***er, i was right and there was nothing i could have done.

548,Was it a dream or the spirit world incarnate?,Dreams,"Happy October! This is a spooky account of a real occurrence that happened to my mom years ago.

*TW — Trigger warning* content involving suicide 

Spirits were an open topic in my household. Both of my parents delved in various forms of spirituality, both had their own accounts of interactions with the mysterious “spiritual dimension”. Of all my mother’s stories, this one is the most chilling.

About 22 years ago, my mother had a dream that shut her off from any thoughts of spirits. At the time, she was reading The Tibetan Book of the Dead. This text translates the Tibetan Buddhist philosophy of both life and the process of death. (Side note: I recommend it to all readers. There’s some great philosophy in there) One night, she wakes into what she described as a half-dream like state. She had woken because she heard a scream, gaining in intensity. When she opened her eyes, she was met with a gaze of our neighbor; a ghostly image at the side of her bed. In that moment, she said she could feel all of his pain. It was the worst emotional agony she had ever felt. When she fully awoke, he vanished. Later on, my parents were told that this man had hung himself in his garage that night. As you can imagine, the shock to my mother was overwhelming.

So, I ask, is this just a coincidental dream? Or proof that somewhere in the realm of dreaming, we have potential to make connections with another plane of existence?",0,dream spirit world incarnate happy october spooky account real occurrence happened mom year ago tw trigger warning content involving suicide spirit open topic household parent delved various form spirituality account interaction mysterious spiritual dimension mother story one chilling year ago mother dream shut thought spirit time reading tibetan book dead text translates tibetan buddhist philosophy life process death side note recommend reader great philosophy one night wake described half dream like state woken heard scream gaining intensity opened eye met gaze neighbor ghostly image side bed moment said could feel pain worst emotional agony ever felt fully awoke vanished later parent told man hung garage night imagine shock mother overwhelming ask coincidental dream proof somewhere realm dreaming potential make connection another plane existence

551,Lucid dream,Dreams,"One time, about a year ago, I had a very lucid dream. I was in a house and the front door was open, and I was looking out the door from the living room. I realized that I was dreaming somehow, and decided to test my ability to control my dream. I wanted to see a tornado and then one appeared and crossed in front of the open door. I made it disappear and then decided I wanted to see a flock of doves. Instead I saw a flock of pelicans fly by the door outside. I looked it up on google what doves mean in a dream and it mentioned something to do with death. My theory is that, since I wasn’t dying and didn’t know anyone who was, my dream wouldn’t show the doves I wanted to see. So, it showed pelicans instead. The dream interpretation for pelicans says you are taking care of others and it happens that you sometimes forget about yourself. To dream of tornados means that you feel overwhelmed and disappointed. Strangely enough, this describes me perfectly.",0,lucid dream one time year ago lucid dream house front door open looking door living room realized dreaming somehow decided test ability control dream wanted see tornado one appeared crossed front open door made disappear decided wanted see flock dove instead saw flock pelican fly door outside looked google dove mean dream mentioned something death theory since dying know anyone dream show dove wanted see showed pelican instead dream interpretation pelican say taking care others happens sometimes forget dream tornado mean feel overwhelmed disappointed strangely enough describes perfectly
552,"an edgy, overly vivid and detailed dream i had about highschool.",Dreams,"in the dream, i was in really big, golf-cart-rich school with something like 5,000 students. it was ENORMOUS. my squad was all catty white girls and i was somehow the passive leader. anyways it's the championship basketball game and radcliffe (someone i went to highschool with and briefly talked to) is the head and mvp of the basketball team and has been since freshman year, effectively saving the team. we march around campus & the gym, me right next to radcliffe, but he pushes me to the side so some other girl can be next to him and i feel myself getting jealous. i don't even know how to march so i'm clumsily laughing at myself. anyways the pervy old pasty principal pulls me to the side. he wants to talk to me about a student. he really uses this as an opportunity to use me as softcore, safe-for-work porn as he rambles about jagger (who is a guy i actually went to school with until the end of 8th grade), his head in my lap, hand rested on my thigh. i lack the energy or interest  or fear to tell him to leave me alone, so i just let him lay there. i even run my fingers through his hair. i haven't slept in two weeks and i'm actually really bored so it's whatever. we're continuing our conversation and my friends are on our side, as they followed us up and through to the top of the bleachers. Apparently jagger has been through a lot ever since he was a child, which i picked up on anyway. in both real life and in this dream. i tell him how i can tell when people have been through a lot or are going through a lot. i can see it in their eyes and the way they talk. it's obvious, as are ulterior motives and wishes. the principal says he doesn't even get how i can do that. it's really heard for him. he leaves, but not after getting a good feel of me. again, i really don't care. i'm bored. i'm tired. nobody's looking and nobody cares. and if they are looking, they still don't care. i go back over to my friends, who probably aren't actually my friends but two of them are arguing and it's getting intense. i duck as some guy pops his head over the railing at the front of the seats at the top of the bleachers to jeer at a friend behind me. anyways, the argument has now escalated to the point the girls are physically fighting, and our entire group is standing, yet still unnoticed by everyone watching the game. a girl joins the argument, pulling out a knife, and i try to yell for help, but nobody hears me, or they just don't care. she cuts HERSELF. deep. i snatch the knife and wave it in the air, still screaming for help. all the other girls have already run away. i look over at the knife wielding maniac, and she's pissed. which is probably cause i took her knife, but whatever. she doesn't speak, but we're now in something like a dorm/ school that looks like a giant plantation mansion with maybe classrooms but definitely bedrooms and bathrooms. our maniac is now on the floor, passed out. i call the ambulance and the responder is annoyingly calm. i keep having to make sure he's actually still on the phone and hasn't hung up on me, and i'm screaming about the situation, giving him the address of (an old irl friend) and he hangs up. assuming they're still coming, i go to find the girl. by the way, she has blue hair. like teal-blue. and this pretty olive skin and big eyes. this time, she's running the bath and has a hairdryer in her hand, and i remember feeling so, so, sad and feeling so much for her. it was like i could see the sadness inside her leaking out. which is a common thing in my dreams. things people are feeling or thinking inside leak out of them in colors. for her, it was black and blue. it's kinda like smoke, or blue iodine vapor. really specific. anyways, i run to grab it before she gets in and drops it. by the power of good dreams, i succeed and she's once again pissed. according to her, i just don't get it, but i do. i was just like her like three years ago and i show her my (real) scars and manage to calm her down. this is the first time we actually maintain eye contact, and i see all the sadness in her face. in her eyes. i don't think she's slept either, and she surely hasn't eaten anything in twice as long. she's tiny. I'm 5'1 and 120 lbs, and she's TINY. maybe the same height as me, but i'm not sure because we never stand together long enough for me to see, but she's definitely skinny. her nose is little and pointy, and none of these details are actually important but she's SO beautiful and adorable to me. at this point i've basically fallen all the way in love with her, and i've been staring at her for what should be an inappropriate amount of time, but i ask if she needs clothes for the hospital, to which she nods. i figure she doesn't live here because i've never seen her and if i did i would have remembered. we dig through my clothes and i find things for her to take, along with some deodorant and toothpaste and other things you need for a suicide watch visit. i also figure she's been before, because we have a mutual knowledge of what she needs, and i haven't judged and still don't judge. again, i was exactly the same. as we wait, she draws, writing their pronouns down in pink lettering. this is SO detailed but it was so real. i felt and saw everything and the colors were vivid and expressive just like real life. i now know they're possibly non-binary, and we hear the ambulance approach. at first, i think about asking for their number, but i know they'll take her phone so i write mine down on their paper full of doodles so they can call me when they're getting ready to be discharged. they stand, i sit. they kiss me on my cheeks and nose and i try to kiss back, but my lips are super fucking chapped and dry and i can't really open them, which i explain to them. they laugh and i frown. we exchange a hug, and the bored staff put them in a stretcher, and i finally wake up.",0,edgy overly vivid detailed dream highschool dream really big golf cart rich school something like student enormous squad catty white girl somehow passive leader anyways championship basketball game radcliffe someone went highschool briefly talked head mvp basketball team since freshman year effectively saving team march around campus gym right next radcliffe push side girl next feel getting jealous even know march clumsily laughing anyways pervy old pasty principal pull side want talk student really us opportunity use softcore safe work porn ramble jagger guy actually went school end th grade head lap hand rested thigh lack energy interest fear tell leave alone let lay even run finger hair slept two week actually really bored whatever continuing conversation friend side followed u top bleacher apparently jagger lot ever since child picked anyway real life dream tell tell people lot going lot see eye way talk obvious ulterior motif wish principal say even get really heard leaf getting good feel really care bored tired nobody looking nobody care looking still care go back friend probably actually friend two arguing getting intense duck guy pop head railing front seat top bleacher jeer friend behind anyways argument escalated point girl physically fighting entire group standing yet still unnoticed everyone watching game girl join argument pulling knife try yell help nobody hears care cut deep snatch knife wave air still screaming help girl already run away look knife wielding maniac pissed probably cause took knife whatever speak something like dorm school look like giant plantation mansion maybe classroom definitely bedroom bathroom maniac floor passed call ambulance responder annoyingly calm keep make sure actually still phone hung screaming situation giving address old irl friend hang assuming still coming go find girl way blue hair like teal blue pretty olive skin big eye time running bath hairdryer hand remember feeling sad feeling much like could see sadness inside leaking common thing dream thing people feeling thinking inside leak color black blue kinda like smoke blue iodine vapor really specific anyways run grab get drop power good dream succeed pissed according get like like three year ago show real scar manage calm first time actually maintain eye contact see sadness face eye think slept either surely eaten anything twice long tiny lb tiny maybe height sure never stand together long enough see definitely skinny nose little pointy none detail actually important beautiful adorable point basically fallen way love staring inappropriate amount time ask need clothes hospital nod figure live never seen would remembered dig clothes find thing take along deodorant toothpaste thing need suicide watch visit also figure mutual knowledge need judged still judge exactly wait draw writing pronoun pink lettering detailed real felt saw everything color vivid expressive like real life know possibly non binary hear ambulance approach first think asking number know take phone write mine paper full doodle call getting ready discharged stand sit kiss cheek nose try kiss back lip super fucking chapped dry really open explain laugh frown exchange hug bored staff put stretcher finally wake

554,Weird and Kinda Scary/Unsettling Dream,Dreams,"Okay so, it was approximately 3 am, and I was in my bedroom, not sleeping but was in bed. I glance out my bedroom window, (the curtains were open for some reason, which is weird because I rarely open them and don't leave them open at night) and I see the moon looking extra large and red (blood moon. So I go to search for my phone to get a picture cuz this is cool. I manage to find it, open the camera app, but by that point the red is gone. I take several pictures then look out the window again just in time to see the moon pass really quickly over the top of my house looking huge (as if it were only half a mile away) For some reason almost everyone in the neighborhood is outside at this point and my neighbor is outside walking her 3 dogs, on of which is actually dead in real life. The dogs freak out and for a split second, I get a mental image of Jigsaw in my head. I start to panic at this point, but am still looking out the window to see a lot of bizarre things. (A Minecraft Enderman is the one I remember but there was more stuff) I go to my mother's bedroom and tell her everything that happened and she starts getting up, and preparing for me, her and the dog to leave. I head back to my bedroom to get dressed and I see someone we know outside, ""borrowing"" my mom's car. The thing is, the car doesn't work, it won't even leave the driveway, but she manages to get it started, and she drives away. About this time, my dream ended because I was woken up by tapping on my window.",0,weird kinda scary unsettling dream okay approximately bedroom sleeping bed glance bedroom window curtain open reason weird rarely open leave open night see moon looking extra large red blood moon go search phone get picture cuz cool manage find open camera app point red gone take several picture look window time see moon pas really quickly top house looking huge half mile away reason almost everyone neighborhood outside point neighbor outside walking dog actually dead real life dog freak split second get mental image jigsaw head start panic point still looking window see lot bizarre thing minecraft enderman one remember stuff go mother bedroom tell everything happened start getting preparing dog leave head back bedroom get dressed see someone know outside borrowing mom car thing car work even leave driveway manages get started drive away time dream ended woken tapping window
555,"Redhead with green eyes, weird lucid dream! (Need help understanding it)",Dreams,"Hello, 

I am no stranger towards lucid dreams, or out of body experience. In the same fashion, I used to have them every day as growing up through my teen years. However, this one was a bit different, and a little more real than ""my"" usual lucid dreaming experience. 

I'll physically describe the woman, so you have a better understanding of her.  

A young woman around the same age as me (I am 22-year-old male), super-bright ginger hair, but redder. Moreover, bright clean green eyes, by that I mean like just generally beautiful green eyes that just pop in your face, I have never seen anything like that before. Pale white skin, and overall I feel very calm when I am around her in the dream.  

\*back to dream\* 

First one 2 weeks ago, I was kinda going in and out within the dream exploring this forest, and I found her next to this cabin. We didn't talk, nor say a word, but just eye contact. The more we looked, the more we understood until the erotic part started. But it wasn't like any other sex dream I had, like I felt everything beyond everything. The weirdest part of the dream, we did not break eye contact once. 

The dream I had today: the same woman, never have I seen her in my life, but before I just remember those green eyes, and how physically I just couldn't do anything. As if, just looking at her eyes made everything just go away, melt, and it was just me, and this redhead in a bed looking at each other, until we started kissing (a bed I have also never seen before). A very old style bed too. 

Now, I do have mixed feelings, because I feel good within the dream, but mixed afterward - however, I feel like I am not really in control, like the usual setting for me within a lucid dream I act on logic and instinct, but this was different. As if it wasn't logic, nor instinct, but a calling. 

&#x200B;

Sometimes the highways have these super complicated interchanges with extremely high ramps and bridges, and other times they lead to weird places (one time I dreamt that a local DFW highway had a dead end at a casino strip in the middle of some desert).

560,"Betty, WW3, Justin, Interview",Dreams,"Location: New York or SF, A stretch of homes along the embankment of a large river with a large bridge nearby. 

Dream started by knocking at my friend Betty's house (She use to be a friend of mine that I had a thing for, but she passed away). I wanted to stick around but she wanted me to go.  attention is drawn to a nearby window. Large Military ships carrying fighter jets and Missiles can be seen cruising down the river and the environment turns dark and stormy.  Then a random guy from class (David Lee?) Appears at the top of the stairs in his underwear. I go to leave but when I open the door some of her many cats get out and I have to round them back in. I finally manage to leave and head down the street towards the bridge. I find my friend friend Justin standing by his car, waiting. Humvee military vehicles occasionally pass us.  I ask him for a ride but he says he's busy with other friends right now as I turn to see them in the car. I walk to another house in the opposite direction that overlooks a cliff. I have come for what appears to be an interview at a restaurant/home set up.  I walked past the dining/living room that has an elderly woman sitting on sofa; the decor is old and grungy, much like the oldy lady. I reach the kitchen, which on the contrary is modern and clean, and begin my interview with an older and clean looking couple. They have me do a test where I chop up a salad and present it to them. I seem to get the job and they tell me to have the oldy grungy lady in the living room show me how to set the table. When I walk over I find her with her head back on the sofa, frozen and presumably dead. I head back to the kitchen to let the couple know but I see them frozen in place while standing up. I run back to get out of the house but begin to levitate to the ceiling. My head hits the ceiling and I immediately wake up (Now IRL) to the sound of firetrucks passing my home.

561,Bare w me I'm tired,Dreams,"Little bit of back story, I've had dreams involving this blue flower or some shit like 30 plus times and they've always taken place in the past and I would have to do numerous chores for ancient beings and when done the flower would appear out of the ground and in the water, so obviously I was like oh the ancient ones have shown they're gratitude I better yoink the boi and keep em, but as soon as I grab the flower I either wake up or I'm in a different place in the past. I had dreams like this for months straight and then it all stopped abruptly once I finally took the flower and saw myself holding it in my hand but like in third person kind of, like not my perspective. Super trip anyways here ya go. 

So it was in the future but not too far in the future but like all the people from my school and other people in they age group were there and everyone was walking up this giant hill and I was like wtf is this and so I parked my car and started walking up with them and I asked around and people only said  ""if you dont know then you dont know."" . Eventually i found one of my old friends, I knew if I asked the right questions I could get the answer I need just because of how me and this dude used to be, so i was like ""bro you're not gonna do it are you?"" And of course he was like ""I mean I'll drink the shit but idk about the flower I really only came for the steak"" And that instantly gave me flashbacks of all the fucking trials I did in my other dreams so I was like oh shit this is about to be good. Well when we made it to the top of the hill we were on a road called memory lane, it was just a road, but once you reached it you had to walk past every home you've lived in, and every house you've ever been to. Most people were already out but it took my moving every second ass a while. And by the time I came out we were no longer on a road but in a playground. The playground was basically are last chance to turn back and our last chance to socialize. (And what's even weirder is How the dream before this ties into it so perfectly with no foreshadowing at all.) But yeah alot of people turned back. I told my friend I'd do it if he did it but hed have to explain it to me completley. And he did, basically there was this ritual only people of a certain age were invited to meant to show the truth. And it was kind of like everybody is doing it we have to do it kinda thing. And I think the year was 2035 but I'm not sure I just know we were in our 20s and we are all like 18 now.  But somehow I became the cook and one of the people who ran the shit came up to me and was like please be seated and I had to explain like oh no I work here and then I had a flashback to my real life job at petland and started thinking how did I really get here? And then I went over to the table and started serving people their food and I saw my brother in laws little brother and to put it simply I was not happy. I was like what the fuck are you doing here you are not allowed. And he said oh God here we go hes gonna tell my mother. And I started to crouch down to where he was seated and started telling him Ethan it's not that I'm gonna tell your mom it's that I, i then got cut off by the same dude that told me to be seated and he was like good because i would have to gut you. And I knew somehow exactly what to do and I stood up cut his hand and then mine but like his right one and my right one and shook hands with him twice. The first time I swore to the order. The second time was an oath to silence. And he nodded and told me not to worry because my brother in laws little brother didn't actually do the ritual and he got upset about it and eventually left.
 Well
The ritual is. 
1 gallon of some dark red liquid? 
I dont think its blood i dont think they would do that 
It's probably wine but honestly could be anything. 
And then you eat all of the steak 
You then you'll have to rinse it out with a gallon of red koolaid. 
And then consume that damn flower
And I believe they were using humans bodies as like a filter/vessel for whatever they were producing. But everybody was out at that point. 
I stayed around to see if anything crazy would happen but after a few hours the people from the prder came in and looked around and said ah yes we've already checked in with the south so if the north and west have begun this will fix their atmosphere. at that point I told em ima dip gotta go get the girl. And they had me do the same oath of silence and has me swear to the order for each member. 
For some reason I had my step dads pryus, apparently something happened to him and he wasnt around and mom was always at work. But besides the point, I made it to the girls house and it was very very different. And of course her parents didnt want me to come in if they were asleep but idc. I walked in went into her room and she was starting up at the moon and the sun. 
I'd say it was around 6 PM. The sun shining bright af, but the moon there in the distance
She looked up for a second and then turned around back to me and we started kissing and I layed her on the bed and asked her where her parents were and if she wanted to come with. And she was like oh they're in there sleeping you should go before they wake up. We had along conversation talked for about an hour and the sun started to go down, but I made it outside with some shit she wanted me to take to my house because she planned on moving in since she was done with college. And I made it outside but I dropped a movie in her pond. And it was a very tiny pond like 🏃‍♀️ this being a human (.....) was the size of the pond. Anyways I went down to pick it up and dropped something else, tried to grab it again and dropped my phone. Eventually I had dropped everything and just put my head in the water because I couldnt see where the shit went without doing so. Well I got it all back and started walking to my car but then noticed my girlfriend was walking over to me. She started telling me ""you already know, you've known all along for you were chosen to know. Why don't you just know"" 

I did not know. 

But then the sun started getting darker. And it exploded 
As it exploded it turned into orbs of energy or light flying around the earth and all the stars and cloud dissapeared. She told me about how the earth is really contained inside of a temple. We were a test for an ancient but advanced civilization in space similar to humans, wondering how we would have been if we never had the technological boom, if we had limited resources, if we were left to our own devices which apparently they were humans, became addicted to progress, became androids, and then were basically capable of some kirby type shit, like you are what the fuck you eat when your them dude.  They tried to put us on Mars but they kinds made it go big boom instead of little boom, So they took over the dinosaurs planet and decided it was the right one. Then they put the earliest ancestors to man on the planet. They made a temple around the planet and a spell that was unbreakable until knowledge had been recycled numerous amounts of times. Space wasnt space how we know it, we were shown a fake space, all the planets where nasa has robots taking footage and images were actually fake planets and space put into the temple to keep us from seeing the abundant life off of our planet. Now keep in mind these people were developed and sophisticated, to us they used magic but in reality it was science, like Our universe was there but it wasnt really the universe. And now that the spell was broken. Everyone on earth was in a panic. Ten giant stone pillars fell around the earth, and I was like well it's time to dip so me and girl got in the car and drove. After I proposed to her and she said yeah sure ofc cause ya know sun kinda exploded. Anyways yeah I woke up and I hate myself because that was a 10 out of 10 dream.

562,Half dream half-real​ experience in Sober October,Dreams,"This month I'm doing Sober October, which means I cut drugs & stuff (I'm a daily weed smoker and sometimes I take psy stuff).

All these dreams about this person feels so real.

566,Why do I always dream about my teeth and my father ?,Dreams,"I've always had disturbing dreams. Last night I dreamed about my teeth again and don't know what it means. Let me tell you what was my dream about. (to better visualize the story, I'm a girl and I'm 20)

In my dream, I don't remember how, I was under the influence of a young man and his mother. 
The man stole both my front teeth while I was drugged. He remplaced them with one single bigger tooth from an unknown animal. When I woke up after this ""surgery"" and saw the horrible result, my first instinct was to think ""It's ok, my front teeth are repairable. I'm glad he did not steal my extra tooth.""
(when I was a child, I really used to have an extra tooth. It has been broken on accident)

The man and his mother were not aggressive at all to me. They were just really weird to each other, having insane conversations. I wasn't captive, I just had no way to go back home. 
The mother said they had to do something important in town and she gave to me the keys of their boat for me to sleep in. I'm afraid of ocean but I had to say yes. So I went to sleep in the boat while they two went away with their car. Then I realised I wasn't alone on board, there was also a man. Actually he was my father, but in my dream we did not know each other. I don't know if we were even related.

He convinced me to start the boat. He said I should trust him if I did not want to lose more of my teeth. The sea was rough and I fell overboard. I do not know how to swim well and I struggled in the water. I kept my head out of the water enough to see that boat driver seemed not to give a fck at all, he was not even looking at me. I thought I was going to die but as I was totally hopeless, the boat came back and the driver saved me. He said I was right to trust him and he thanked me for it.

We arrived at a harbor and we walked in the city until the day came up. He explained there was a tram that could take me home. The tram arrived and when I was about to get in, he told me he wasn't coming with me. He said ""It is your home, not mine"". He said I was pretty, I smiled and then he noticed my extra tooth was broken in two part. He advised me to have it cut into two small teeth replace the ones I lost. The tram moved away and I woke up.

Well, the end. I don't know what it is supposed to mean. I often dream about my father or about my teeth, sometimes both. In real life I have normal teeth and I don't remember my father a lot (we were not very close and he died a long time ago). So the ""paternal figure"" is abstract to me. I never really experienced abuses neither. 
Hm... who has a clue ? Do you know how to analyse this kind of dreams ?

567,Dreaming about ...Maria?,Dreams,"So this happened last night...

We find ourselves on a west side street on an sweltering August evening. The air is thick, smells of diesel from cars idling in traffic. An old landlady is hanging laundry between buildings. There’s a commotion and a slammed door. An incredibly handsome man with slicked back hair, a half unbuttoned shirt and a chest for the Gods runs out to the street. He turns and looks up and yells “what a wonderful sound!” I look up and see a girl in the window. An ingenue; stunningly beautiful. The setting sun lights her face in a pink and orange glow. 

“Tony! I’ll see you soon, you’re the only thing I see!” She calls out. 

I realize it’s the 1950’s. Guess where this is going? 

She sees me. “Who is that?” But I’m smitten. 

Tiny and I look at each other and burst out into song. We both sing to her, “Maria! Maria! Maria!”

569,Ghost Tarot Card Dream,Dreams,"   In the dream I find a box of tarot cards, my first reaction is ""Free tarot deck, sweet!"". This goes about as well as you'd think.


   I keep getting the Three of Swords every time. For people who don't mess with tarot  cards a lot three of swords means heartbreak and emotional pain. I'm thoroughly spooked so I throw the deck out the window. Only to have it reappear in my pocket. I try every way I can think of to get rid of it (burning, burial, ect.) But it always reappears.


   At this point I've almost gave up  but while I'm looking through the pictures I've taken with my phone I see one from the night I found the tarot card, with a ghost girl in the background. She looked kinda like the girl from The Ring but she was impossibly pale and had teeth that resembled a sharks that barely fit in her mouth.


   I do some research and somehow I find out what happened to the girl. She was from a wealthy family and her parents were getting a divorce. 


   The lawyer said that the Dad stood to gain a lot of money by losing custody. Don't ask me how that works because I have no clue. The Mom ends up dying before she can get custody, so either the Dad or the lawyer drowns the girl because she doesn't have a use anymore.
   

   I manage to appease the girl by going to the lake and throwing her tarot deck in along with something for her to entertain herself with. We end up being friends and chatting afterwards because she was just lonely and looking for attention.",0,ghost tarot card dream dream find box tarot card first reaction free tarot deck sweet go well think keep getting three sword every time people mess tarot card lot three sword mean heartbreak emotional pain thoroughly spooked throw deck window reappear pocket try every way think get rid burning burial ect always reappears point almost gave looking picture taken phone see one night found tarot card ghost girl background looked kinda like girl ring impossibly pale teeth resembled shark barely fit mouth research somehow find happened girl wealthy family parent getting divorce lawyer said dad stood gain lot money losing custody ask work clue mom end dying get custody either dad lawyer drowns girl use anymore manage appease girl going lake throwing tarot deck along something entertain end friend chatting afterwards lonely looking attention

577,"I had a extremely vivid, long dream about the world ending via a meteor, which felt like hours, and it has affected me in real life.",Dreams,"So I had a sleepover with my friend, i'm young and only browse reddit but this dream, it's messed with my mind. At first the dream was realistic, with the news just frantically proclaiming a meteor destined to hit earth was on its way within the day. My family reacted as you would expect but they weren't the focus. Strangely I was sent to school one last time, but as I was with my friends I felt I strong, godlike feeling inside me as sadness as confusion washed over me. My friend asked me, ""do you believe in heaven? Like a afterlife after the meteor hits."" I didn't answer as I got lost in my thoughts. I was absolutely terrified of nothing after death. Just ceasing to exist terrifies me and no after life would suck ass. I'm  thinking about how if I died, what would happen if there was a afterlife. Were the Greeks right? Christians? Hindus couldn't be right if I was just reborn into a fiery hellish Earth. Maybe god sent a asteroid because he got bored of Humans. ""Yeah y'all can go to heaven I have a new idea. I call them Godlings and unlike some shitty humans, they all WORSHIP me."" After my hours of thinking, Me, being a clout chasing 8th grader that  even while facing death ignored the unpopular kids that I was friends with many years before and hanged out with the popular kids like a little shit. When I got home my dream started bending reality. I was selected to go through a bridge to another planet that had appeared. A holy bridge that just appeared, for some reason it didn't faze nor confuse me,  I just said. ""Oh i'll survive."" Of course this dream brought out the true instincts of survival inside me. I care and love my family but they were forcefully pushed back in the list of priorities inside my mind. I ran through the bridge not looking back, it was only a few 100 meters long but it was sort of a magic portal to a safe, beautiful world. I fell out through the air and landed on the ground unscathed, I wondered if this was just how I traveled into the afterlife. That the meteor had already hit and this was the way to reach the afterlife. I naturally grouped up with all my friends who had been on the bridge with me. We looked around and had a sudden aggression towards a group of ""unpopular"" kids. We were assholes, and chased them on magical boats through the water while feeling a constant holy divine presence watching over us. The most vivid part was when me and an acquaintance fell through a water fall. The fall was a couple 100 meters but I remember just having instructions on how to ""protect"" myself from the fall just, appear, inside my mind. We all forget about the chase and start walking until we find houses, and get to choose where we live. We all ""saw"" a holy presence which was actually a voice in our minds with a shining light always in the corner of our eye. It offered us homes. When I selected my house I jolted awake, still thinking that the asteroid was on its way. I sat awake for another hour thinking about how vivid it was. I feel that same presence at times whenever I'm not around things such as electronics or anything that requires my full attention. I don't know how I feel about death after that dream. I feel like that dream was put there by somebody. Something silly in that dream was that the first thing I did after finding out about the meteor, I snapped my ""crush"" that I ""loved"" her. I didn't look at the response and immediately brushed it off. The strange thing was that I wasn't really attracted to her before the dream but my feelings for her have grown a lot within a couple hours. This dream has freaked me out and I needed write about it to get it off my chest.

580,Humiliated by airport customs,Dreams,"I was travelling back to the UK through Amsterdam airport with some colleagues. My colleagues all got through but I was selected for a 'random screening'.

Unfortunately, the customs official couldn't speak English, or so I thought. He was getting angrier and angrier, then I realised all his colleagues were laughing - he was deliberately pretending not to understand me.

Then they gave me a series of complicated immigration forms to complete - things that played on tropes of British people - like I had to sign a form to say I'd never been involved in a fox hunt, and that I'd been to a dentist. The whole time all the Dutch customs officials were laughing.

Then a female customs official came over and started another thing, but whispered to me ""just go along with it, it's part of the Brexit deal, it's easier if you just let them laugh"".

581,A Semi-Lucid Nightmare. Can't Kill Myself In Dreams Anymore and The Monsters Know.,Dreams,"In the beginning I was a famous magician who was lying about their magic powers. I was in a rush to get home to my apartment building, but I was in front of a red light. I called out to this random cop to get him to escort me but by the time he came over light had already turned green. He kept fangirling over me and I tried to tell him that my magic wasn’t actually real, but he didn’t believe me.

*I woke up and went back to sleep. I guess my mind didn’t like that….*

Because suddenly I was high up in an apartment building on one of the top floors, I was trying to hide behind stacks of grey chairs (the ones used in assembly at my primary school). I knew she would find me here, but there was nowhere else to hide! She entered the room and started talking about how ‘all she has been trying to do is protect me,’ (it was the other mother from Caroline, full monster form. Eight limbs all made of needles, cracked skin, just generally bloody terrifying). She was getting closer, I could hear the consistant sharp taps of her steps on the wooden floor. She was almost crawling, using all of her limbs and moving similar to a spider. Fucking Terrifying. Her head was whipping back and forth, frantically scanning the room. 

Inevitably she saw me. She started slamming the stacks of chairs in front of me and soon I was standing in the middle of a hallway. The rows of chairs created the walls taller than me and she crawled beneath them then stood at her full height right in front of me. Too close. I- I didn’t want to hear any more of the horrific things she had to say, I didn't want this, I want to wake up, so I turned to the wall behind me and threw myself out the window. Somehow, I knew it wouldn’t kill me, I knew this wasn’t real, *just a dream, just a dream, just a dream, not real, cant hurt, just a dream*.

As I was falling through the air she was still saying something about how ‘she had been drugging me for a while, but they tested my blood and it’s not the drugs affecting me, it’s something already in my blood, a part of me, that’s fucking me up.’ I saw straight into her beady, black eyes (not buttons, solid black) as she said it, although I was still falling I could clearly see her face. Her face was sunken and pale, she had huge black ovals around both eyes that covered almost half her face. Her voice was loud and clear as I plummeted, I could hear it all running through my mind as I fell, I could see her face and those dead eyes digging away at my soul. I wanted this to be over, I could see the ground getting closer…

 ...but I never hit it. I immediately, suddenly, reappeared directly in front of her, closer than before, she had moved closer. She hadn’t panicked at all, like she knew exactly what would happen. She said that all they’re concerned about is protecting me but that’s not fair, and she mentioned some of my family and friends but I cant recall exactly what she said about them. She kept moving closer and closer, I didn’t know what she was going to do but, as those needle fingers stretched towards me, I was terrified to find out. 

*So I woke myself up.*

*This, I think, was the first dream I noticed that I couldn't kill myself - and believing that this is true has made it so. Since this dream if I ever kill myself to end a dream I (ususally) respawn at the last place I touched, like a videogame. Once I even switched consciousness with a bunch of people, like a lego game, to get away from a flying allegator.... Luckily, my brain will ususally let me bail out when there is no other way out.*

It was very brief, I stopped by after work and had saw you, my parents, and grandma. 

I walked in, to be greeted by a, ""Who is it?"" in a very familiar voice. Only to reply with, ""It's me."" While walking into the family room to see you and hear, ""Raymond!?""

To say the least, I was in shock. At a loss for words from seeing my grandpa in the flesh, at your normal weight.

The rest of the dream was just me telling him how much I missed him and filling him in on my life since June 17, 2019. 

It's been a long few months. I wish I could have another conversation with you. We haven't had one since I visited you in rehab that one time and we watched hockey together.

585,The Gentle Fool,Dreams,"I had a really weird dream that took a surprisingly sharp turn just now. 

I was on top of a hill with a bunch of ""classmates,"" talking to our teacher. It was a kind of sombre setting, as this seemed like some kind of after school, extra credit thing. And I say ""classmates"" because everyone was in very different age groups. I had an assignment due soon and I was preparing how to write it but I couldn't think of a subject, when my teacher suggested I do it on the ""underworld."" A mysterious cave system down by the beach. He was discussing with another student, who was saying it was really dangerous, but then a third student who couldn't have been more than 10 really wanted to check it out. I was trying to start my essay but I kept rewriting the first sentence over and over again and was struggling with writers block. 

At one point the kid said he was going and I decided to go with him to keep an eye on him and make sure nothing happened. As we were walking down towards the beach you could hear the other kid freaking out in the background almost hysterically about how dangerous it was. 

As we walked along the beach, we approached an opening in the side of the hill. Not knowing what to expect, the mood completely changed as we entered the cave. Immediately a saw a bunch of kids standing in the middle of a large chamber looking up in aw at these weird waterfall like pillars lining the walls. The kid said they were calcium pillars. As we walked the gravity in the room changed. Its like we were nearly weightless, making it difficult to walk or move quickly. Another group of kids were standing in the middle looking around in aw, but I quickly realized they weren't the only... entities there.  

I looked up and saw a iron chair with restraints on it and one of the kids strapping himself in. He seemed to be in some kind of a trance. As my eyes adjusted, I realized that there were more compartments, and I made my way up a ledge in order to see into one of the other compartments. There were slabs with what appeared to be bodies restrained to them. Except they weren't kids, they seemed to be dried husks that were glowing and blue.

I saw another chamber opposite to the entrance with stairs leading down it. But as I approached it, I heard a billowy voice exclaim ""I need sustenance,"" and I decided it was time to leave. I slowly made my way across the room and told the kid I was with that we were leaving, who was still struggling to work his way through the low gravity. As my eyes continued to adjust I saw more compartments, including pathways that seemed to continue on forever immediately on both sides of the entrance, as if this room defied the normal laws of space and time. I found that hopping on one foot at a time was the most effective way to move, pushing myself as if I was underwater. Tensions rose as we did this, and it seemed to take forever. 

As we left the cave I remember passing by a pile of beach debris covered in sand. The affects of the weird gravity still acting on me, I pushed off one of them only to realize that it was a pile of old boots that were discarded at the mouth of the cave. We worked our way back to the top of the hill, and after catching my breath, I suddenly knew exactly what to write.",0,gentle fool really weird dream took surprisingly sharp turn top hill bunch classmate talking teacher kind sombre setting seemed like kind school extra credit thing say classmate everyone different age group assignment due soon preparing write think subject teacher suggested underworld mysterious cave system beach discussing another student saying really dangerous third student really wanted check trying start essay kept rewriting first sentence struggling writer block one point kid said going decided go keep eye make sure nothing happened walking towards beach could hear kid freaking background almost hysterically dangerous walked along beach approached opening side hill knowing expect mood completely changed entered cave immediately saw bunch kid standing middle large chamber looking aw weird waterfall like pillar lining wall kid said calcium pillar walked gravity room changed like nearly weightless making difficult walk move quickly another group kid standing middle looking around aw quickly realized entity looked saw iron chair restraint one kid strapping seemed kind trance eye adjusted realized compartment made way ledge order see one compartment slab appeared body restrained except kid seemed dried husk glowing blue saw another chamber opposite entrance stair leading approached heard billowy voice exclaim need sustenance decided time leave slowly made way across room told kid leaving still struggling work way low gravity eye continued adjust saw compartment including pathway seemed continue forever immediately side entrance room defied normal law space time found hopping one foot time effective way move pushing underwater tension rose seemed take forever left cave remember passing pile beach debris covered sand affect weird gravity still acting pushed one realize pile old boot discarded mouth cave worked way back top hill catching breath suddenly knew exactly write
586,Questions about night terrors and such,Dreams,"Sorry in advance for the longer post. I'm having late night can't sleep thought vomit and dream related questions:

I have always suffered from night terrors, sleep walking, and waking nightmares. They have always felt extremely real, been what I can only describe as ""evil"", terrifying, and usually gory, to the point where I went to therapy for them. I wake up screaming, I've left my hotel room in the middle of the night because I sleepwalked right out the door, I accidentally kicked my husband in the chest because I thought I was fighting off a killer, and usually experience utter terror with them. I have had no trauma, other than what comes with being raised in a fundamental Christian School and church, and have no real reason to explain them. My therapist told me there isn't an obvious underlying cause for me to have them (they're pretty much only caused by early childhood trauma) other than I just have a fabulous imagination. On top of those, I have 2 other types of dreams: ones that are the regular typical silly dream type and involve what has happened in my daily life, and ones that involve things, places, and people I've never seen before. The latter of them are extremely vivid. They don't seem like dreams, more like memories and they stick with me. For example, in one of them I was following someone around the corner of some type of roughly carved stairway leading down with torches on the wall. I can still feel the cool, rough stone under my hand as I touched it.

Though my having a fabulous imagination is totally plausible, I've always had this nagging itch of a feeling that it's more than that. Like maybe that I'm more sensitive to the darker things in the universe, I'm astral projecting in my sleep, or something similar. As for the memory like type dreams, I am leaning towards these being past life memory blips as there's no way those are dreams. They feel more real than some of my memories from last week. 


My questions are:
1. Could my night terrors, sleep walking, and waking dreams be something else besides my wonderful imagination? If so, what do you think they are and how should I deal/manage them?

2. If my memory-like dreams are in fact from a past life, how do I learn more about it?",0,question night terror sorry advance longer post late night sleep thought vomit dream related question always suffered night terror sleep walking waking nightmare always felt extremely real describe evil terrifying usually gory point went therapy wake screaming left hotel room middle night sleepwalked right door accidentally kicked husband chest thought fighting killer usually experience utter terror trauma come raised fundamental christian school church real reason explain therapist told obvious underlying cause pretty much caused early childhood trauma fabulous imagination top type dream one regular typical silly dream type involve happened daily life one involve thing place people never seen latter extremely vivid seem like dream like memory stick example one following someone around corner type roughly carved stairway leading torch wall still feel cool rough stone hand touched though fabulous imagination totally plausible always nagging itch feeling like maybe sensitive darker thing universe astral projecting sleep something similar memory like type dream leaning towards past life memory blip way dream feel real memory last week question could night terror sleep walking waking dream something else besides wonderful imagination think deal manage memory like dream fact past life learn

588,The love of my life who faded away like tears in rain,Dreams,"Have you ever had a dream that felt so real, you mourned upon waking?

I watched a YouTube video recently on parallel universes when a segment of it featured a man who had a dream he had been married to the love of his life for ten years, literally lived a daily life including Nature's necessities, going to bed and waking in the morning, but one day reality began to warp and he eventually experienced excruciating pain--at which point he woke in a hospital bed from a 30 day coma after a vehicle accident.

I remembered a dream I had last year and forgot. I had married a woman with light brown hair she often wore in a ponytail. She was maybe 5'8"", Caucasian, she liked to wear jeans, dark blue shoes with white soles, and a burgandy sweater was her favorite because it kept her from being cold, it was like wearing a blanket incognito. She liked to window shop, she didn't care for eating out, and she loved movies and to read, but her taste varied. We were together for months. I didn't experience it in real time, I experienced snippets, like 30 seconds here, a few minutes there, an hour, nothing more, but the moments spanned several months at least. I knew her name, I met her parents (they liked me). She had no siblings. I can't remember her name, though, but I can see her in my mind clearly, and there is no one from my waking world that could have inspired the creation of this woman. She was NOT a dream character. She was real. At one point, we were going to bed and I was just staring at her. She asked what was wrong and I told her I didn't want to go to sleep because I was afraid that if I did I would never wake up there again, that I would never see her again or be able to find her. She laughed and told me how silly that was, and that she was not going anywhere. I went to sleep there and woke up here. It was jarring, I've never experienced anything like that before. I mourned losing her like I had lost a family member, until I fell asleep again and forgot about her. Just like I told her I would.

I've not seen her since, but now that I remember her, I can try to find her. Maybe.

615,Recurring dream of missing last bus/train/plane home.,Dreams,"Hey!

So I have this recurring motif in many of my dreams (lately it has been in almost every single one). I can dream about anything, usually mixture of memories and thoughts of the previous day, but it always ends the same - I want to get home from wherever I am but miss the last bus/train/plane home. Sometimes I am with someone, with whom I dreamed about, but usually it's just me.

These are some of my findings:

*  I always try to get home, very rarely a different destination. 
* I always miss the LAST bus, so there is usually no way to get home, as I don't own a car. 
* It is always dark outside, all of the sudden it gets dark and I know I should get home, but don't know how.
* I try to think of ways how to get home - hitchhiking, walking, trying to find different means of transport (JUST GET ME HOME kind of thoughts)
* I never reach home I ALWAYS wake up before I can figure out how to get there.
* I usually have this feeling of fear of the unknown,  anxious thoughts of being left somewhere, but sometimes filled with optimistic feeling of trying new things - like since I am bound to stay outside (till the first bus comes) I can think of new things to do during the night.

What do you think? I usually understand my dreams well, but this strange theme is so repetitive, that I really think it has some kind of importance.",0,recurring dream missing last bus train plane home hey recurring motif many dream lately almost every single one dream anything usually mixture memory thought previous day always end want get home wherever miss last bus train plane home sometimes someone dreamed usually finding always try get home rarely different destination always miss last bus usually way get home car always dark outside sudden get dark know get home know try think way get home hitchhiking walking trying find different mean transport get home kind thought never reach home always wake figure get usually feeling fear unknown anxious thought left somewhere sometimes filled optimistic feeling trying new thing like since bound stay outside till first bus come think new thing night think usually understand dream well strange theme repetitive really think kind importance
616,Sinking: Open to Interpretation,Dreams,"I sat on a tiny boat in the middle of the sea. It was nice out, the sun way up ahead and a light ocean breeze flowing through my hair. I could see for miles, no land in sight. Just blue, blue from the sky and the ocean, forming an endless landscape everywhere you looked. There were no birds, no fish, no life other than me. I was alone. I looked around for a few minutes, until the warm sun mixed with the cooling salty breeze convinced me to sleep.


I slept for I don't know how long. Long enough for the sun to fall considerably, so a sunset was touching the water, turning a slice of the horizon in front of me into liquid gold. Small waves licked the side of my boat, rocking it gently. An anchor lying on the floor of the boat shined in the perfect angle of sunlight. I stared at it, staring at the white glint that reflected off of it. I felt a shiver as I finally looked up again, to see that clouds had gathered in the sky, leaving darkness. The sun had retreated beyond the horizon. All that was left was water and dark skies.


It was beginning to get colder.


The clouds had darkened and became more threatening, looming above me. Finally it came: a crack of thunder, and a single bolt of lightning that arched across the heavens. As soon as that happened, the sky opened up and let out a torrent larger than any I had ever heard of. The rain fell in sheets, heavy and fast. Waves started appearing, beginning at just a few feet tall, but growing quickly. What started as harmless waves turned into walls of water the size of buildings, as big as 70 feet tall. There was no way my boat would be able to handle the damage that would be caused if I was hit. 


After what felt like hours of waiting, a wave finally crashed into my vessel, and it immediately collapsed on itself. I sank. Deeper, deeper, deeper still, until I was sure that I was miles under the water. Lightning continued to crash overhead, occasionally illuminating the area around me.


The water was cold and dark. The water filled my ears, making my surroundings completely silent. I was in an endless expanse of water. Somehow I wasn't suffocating. Or was I just not breathing? I'm not sure. All I knew was that I was sinking into what felt like a depth that would go on forever. I stared up towards the surface of the water that I had once been floating on. The wreckage of my tiny ship was nowhere to be seen. I lost hope. I stopped thinking, stopped feeling. I let myself fall.


There was another crack of lightning. I was suddenly aware of every inch of my body. Something was wrong. The water got colder suddenly. I closed my eyes and counted to ten. I opened them again. Dark. I could see nothing. My eyes shut again. I count to ten. Open. Another flash of lightning.


But this time, I see the silhouette of some massive serpentine creature.",0,sinking open interpretation sat tiny boat middle sea nice sun way ahead light ocean breeze flowing hair could see mile land sight blue blue sky ocean forming endless landscape everywhere looked bird fish life alone looked around minute warm sun mixed cooling salty breeze convinced sleep slept know long long enough sun fall considerably sunset touching water turning slice horizon front liquid gold small wave licked side boat rocking gently anchor lying floor boat shined perfect angle sunlight stared staring white glint reflected felt shiver finally looked see cloud gathered sky leaving darkness sun retreated beyond horizon left water dark sky beginning get colder cloud darkened became threatening looming finally came crack thunder single bolt lightning arched across heaven soon happened sky opened let torrent larger ever heard rain fell sheet heavy fast wave started appearing beginning foot tall growing quickly started harmless wave turned wall water size building big foot tall way boat would able handle damage would caused hit felt like hour waiting wave finally crashed vessel immediately collapsed sank deeper deeper deeper still sure mile water lightning continued crash overhead occasionally illuminating area around water cold dark water filled ear making surroundings completely silent endless expanse water somehow suffocating breathing sure knew sinking felt like depth would go forever stared towards surface water floating wreckage tiny ship nowhere seen lost hope stopped thinking stopped feeling let fall another crack lightning suddenly aware every inch body something wrong water got colder suddenly closed eye counted ten opened dark could see nothing eye shut count ten open another flash lightning time see silhouette massive serpentine creature
617,Weather controlled by bureaucracy,Dreams,"I have to wonder if my subconscious is making a statement about how much paperwork there is in life.

I've had a series of weather or disaster related dreams where the mechanics of the weather and such hinged on paperwork. 

One dream had a this huge tornado in the distance that kept coming closer. I found a line of people and was yelling at them that there was a tornado and to seek shelter. An official came by and said to calm down, this is a scheduled tornado, and it will wait till everyone is done with the paperwork before it would come through. When you filled out the paperwork, you were then taken to the shelter via bulldozer. Sure enough, the tornado stopped progressing and waited for everyone to finish up and didn't start destroying things again until it was given the go ahead.

The other dream I remember well had a requirement that you needed a passport to switch seasons. If you didn't have one, you would be stuck in whatever season you were in. You could pay to skip seasons as well if you didn't like one, you just needed the fee and the appropriate paperwork. All seasons existed in slightly separated dimensions, but you could still see other people experiencing them. So, you could be out in shorts and having something cool to drink while watching your neighbor bundled up, shivering and shoveling snow you couldn't see.",0,weather controlled bureaucracy wonder subconscious making statement much paperwork life series weather disaster related dream mechanic weather hinged paperwork one dream huge tornado distance kept coming closer found line people yelling tornado seek shelter official came said calm scheduled tornado wait till everyone done paperwork would come filled paperwork taken shelter via bulldozer sure enough tornado stopped progressing waited everyone finish start destroying thing given go ahead dream remember well requirement needed passport switch season one would stuck whatever season could pay skip season well like one needed fee appropriate paperwork season existed slightly separated dimension could still see people experiencing could short something cool drink watching neighbor bundled shivering shoveling snow see

619,Indian Store criminals or Kindergarten school dream?,Dreams,"I had a dream last night that me and my family drove and went to this Indian store that was ghetto and was a whole in the wall but it was not feeling like one and it kinda looked official” enough.

Once we went inside it looked nice and very inviting and it was very nice and there was a lot of couches and chairs and the front desk looked like a ticket stand like at a resort and it was made of wood and stuff and it looked like someone’s else’s home and like a bookshelf where all the products were being stored but we were at a store and someone’s house at the same time. 

There was some people there but not a lot. 

I was looking around a lot since I was interested in the place until I looked over and I saw mom and dad with his friend Mike, my moms friend Effie, and Nina with Donovan and them signing forms on a  little bar with a white woman at the desk who acted very condescending and very loudmouthed and was acting like I was a child saying stuff like, “Now remember young man! Do not!” when I asked her what was going on with my family. There was also a sign at the ticket stand front desk on the ramp saying, “Stay in here and shop with us and think about what you’ve done young man!” 

I went over to them and ask them what they were doing and they said they were bored and they were leaving but they had to sign a bunch of papers and have a buddy with them before they could which even though was easy to do it was completely tedious and I remember I was scared thinking it was gonna apply to me and the woman said to me in a very condescending but playful tone  that I could only have one buddy per person and one form per person.

Basically I was looking around the store while parents waited for me and pretty soon then I got bored and wanted to leave and they said I needed a buddy and to go find one and so I did and I used another copy of Effie as my buddy and once I got up there I was handed a book which had the form in it but they said that hat was just the brochure and I had a hard time trying to find out which one was which until I eventually found the form until they told me that that wasn’t the real form and then pretty soon they gave me a new one

I asked them, “Who do you think you are!” And they said, “We get that l the time. We wanna make friends. Have experiences. We want to create new friends for you.” And all I said was is, “All you’re creating is nothing but pain and kidnapping!” And I just remember reaching out for my phone trying to call the police but my phone wouldn’t work. 

Also I remember I was signing the real form with the help of the man at the front desk which looked like a ticket stand and I just remember it was a children’s test with pictures on it before I actually could sign the form and the first question was, “What City is this? It’s a place with parties, girls, and entertainment!” And it was a shilouette if a city which was Vegas and I obviously said so and then the man said, “Ah ah ah! Look at the city. Does it look like anything to you? No fair. Keep going!” And I tried telling him it’s Vegas cause it was completely obvious that it was. And I just remember the form got bigger and bigger and they said it was for emailing purposes and I just tried signing the form and scribbling not thinking about anything and trying to slap the man and the woman but they caught my slap before I could do anything and took my phone and threw it behind their desks and then I tried getting out myself of the place and I grabbed my phone and they blocking the way from where the exit was and saying, “Off-limits mister! Finish your waiver!”

627,Sequence of three movie-like dreams in which I was other people,Dreams,"1) I dreamed I was sleeping and in that inner dream I was a black bald young american guy who was fat, tall, happy, simple, very calm and somewhat dumb. The black young fat me worked as a private van driver. I was walking around inside a very stereotypical american suburban house, and somehow I knew my life was a very stereotypical bullshit TV show. I was happy because I was about to get married but I didn't know who the bride was. All I knew is that she was black and beautiful. But I didn't find that weird because I was not a real person and I knew that. I was a fictional TV character and my thoughts and feelings were not controlled by myself (like that movie ""death and taxes""). There were some random black people walking around that house too, but I can't remember if we talked. Then I ""woke up"" and googled ""dream meaning black guy about to get married"" in my mobile phone. My hand was white, so in this outer dream I was white. I found out it was a multi-level dream because the results were nonsense words that didn't form sentences. The only thing is that the word ""NOW"" appeared like every four words capitalised and in italic. The inner dream was in third person (I see myself walking around) and the outer dream was in first person. First person is unusual for me.

\-----

2) There were two guys talking. They were both black. One was mid-age with some grey hair and a moustache and the other was old and looked like B. B. King at 85 years old (almost moustache left). The camera kept switching between them like a dialogue in a movie. The weird thing is that I was both of them, I knew that and each one of me's had separate thoughts. Like if I used a time-machine to go to the future ask advice to my old self (not the other way around because I felt like I was primarily the mid-age one). We were sit in comfortable leather chairs in a quiet large room talking about how wonderful it is to have internet and be able to learn anything we want, despite not having enough time in life to learn everything there is to learn. Very pleasant dream. Again, why was I black and this time not fat nor bald?

\-----

3) This one was mind-blowing. I was a fat Italian guy with a very hot blonde wife who looked like a porn star with fake boobs, but she was actually a good woman and I was the scum. She was telling me she was pregnant, without any emotion and I was also not even listening to her. Suddenly the movie cut to a porn clip were I was f\*\*\*ing her in an acrobatic position, which was hilarious because my belly was huge. Then I remembered I had had a vasectomy shortly before that and she didn't knew, so she had to be cheating on me and that was weird because I was supposed to be the scum, not her. But here is where it gets really interesting:

the Italian me looked at the screen of the movie, breaking the fourth wall, and in that moment he realised he was in a movie because an alternate version of me popped into existence in the other side, and the camera backed away showing the Italian me and our wife in a big screen. Both me's didn't know how the one who just popped into existence looked like, but we both knew the alternate me was the father of the baby because we knew that right after watching the movie that alternate me would go inside the movie but back in time and change the chain of events so he would be the one f\*\*\*ing our wife in our collective memory. So together we would hack the chain of events so that our wife still cheats on us but with ourselves.

Both me's grinned at each other as if the Italian knew where the eyes of the alternate me were. We were satisfied because the alternate me, while back in the past in the reality of the Italian me, had also secretly moved all assets of the Italian me out of american jurisdiction and had hidden a plane ticket in the suit the Italian me was wearing. The alternate me ceased to exist when the Italian me felt the plane ticket appear in his pocket. The flight was scheduled to a few hours after that moment.

The Italian me was going to disappear and leave our clueless disloyal wife with nothing but a kid that wouldn't look like the Italian me nor have his DNA but would still pass on her beauty as well as my intelligence (which I didn't think I had in the beginning of the dream).

One of my old friends comes up to me and starts laughing at me becuase the girl told me no. After we get done running our whole class goes outside to the field. At the back of the field there was a forest with a hill. The teacher tells us there are shrooms in the area and says we have to get them all.

629,"Very vivid, but symbolic dream I just had and need interpretation",Dreams,"I had a dream that I was at my dads place, my mother was also there (they’ve been separated for years.) and so was my grandmother. Well, across the lake there was an automotive factory (not there in real life.) and a wooden bridge connected the opposite side to ours. Well, several new cars were being driven out, but one crashes and fell into the lake, where I promptly hopped out to go and help them.

I had to walk through a hotel that wasn’t there, a did see a few skulls on one part of the beach where several dudes were working. What’s more is that the sun didn’t rise till late in the day, and when it did, black clouds blocked out its light. 

If anyone can interpret this dream, please let me know.

630,I had motion sickness when I woke up.,Dreams,"I had the craziest dream the other night. It starts out I’m in this little rocket built for 2 people. In the lower section is a coworker, I’ll call him R.  R is seated below me in the rocket where all the controls are.  I’m above him in a harness of sorts. It becomes apparent that this is my first time heading to space. Apparently, I’ve never gone past our atmosphere. 
We take off and my heart falls to my stomach and I’m scared and feeling like I’m going to throw up, the whole time watching out a window as my view goes from ground level on earth straight up to space. R reaches up to take my hand and tell me some sweet comforting things because he likes me and he’s done this before. 
We are only in space briefly before we come back down to earth and “dock” in the back of an old family video in town. We part ways and as I’m walking home, there are kids playing and I see a guy walking, appearing disoriented. As he gets closer, I realize he is3D but he looks “fuzzy” . Not his outline, but everything else about him looks like the screen on an old television set. Like I was watching an old movie on one. 
This kid playing near by sees him too and is scared. We confirm that we are both seeing the same thing and I realize this “fuzzy” person is a dead person. And then I realize I’m seeing lots of these versions of dead people.

631,I dreamt about asking the devil the secrets of the world.,Dreams,"First of all, this is a REALLY weird dream. I watched a horror movie called ""Midsommar"" on the same night and it probably influenced this dream.

I just woke up and took notes from what I felt from the dream so I wouldn't forget about it. Don't mind if it's too weird. These are the first words I could describe from it:

""I was in a haunted house.

And there was blood in that house. And guts. Of who's I don't know. 

And there was evil.

But I didn't believe in evil. Neither was afraid of it.

And a black cat appeared, carrying a knife. It hid, but I could still see the knife. And a voice told me it was the devil. 

I didn't believe in the voice. So the voice told me to go to the cat and ask him if he was the devil. And then to ask him the secrets of the world.

I think that voice was me.

And then I came after the black cat, which tried to attack me with the knife. But I could easily handle it. 

The cat ran, and I was led to a mirror.

In the mirror, I looked at myself and called for the devil. He didn't appear to me.

And I asked, ""Why are there secrets to the world?"" 

The face, which was mine, got possessed by the devil. The eyes turned to white and the mouth was smiling widely, reaching my ears, showing up big teeth. 

He said, ""because I want to"".

In another mirror, figures appeared. Religious folklore figures passed by the mirror. The history of a church. However, that history told by the mirror was in backward. From the present church to its beginnings.

And that was scary.

Later we found wounded people in the sea. A man and two women. The man had his leg broken, with an exposed bone, his head was bloody, his eyes were red, his skin was pale white and his belly was cut open and his guts were coming out of it. The women were also pale and bloody, with wounds in the ear and neck. But there was a lot of mysterious blood on their clothes from an unknown wound.  

I think those wounded people and the backward gospel were both secrets of the world""",0,dreamt asking devil secret world first really weird dream watched horror movie called midsommar night probably influenced dream woke took note felt dream forget mind weird first word could describe haunted house blood house gut know evil believe evil neither afraid black cat appeared carrying knife hid could still see knife voice told devil believe voice voice told go cat ask devil ask secret world think voice came black cat tried attack knife could easily handle cat ran led mirror mirror looked called devil appear asked secret world face mine got possessed devil eye turned white mouth smiling widely reaching ear showing big teeth said want another mirror figure appeared religious folklore figure passed mirror history church however history told mirror backward present church beginning scary later found wounded people sea man two woman man leg broken exposed bone head bloody eye red skin pale white belly cut open gut coming woman also pale bloody wound ear neck lot mysterious blood clothes unknown wound think wounded people backward gospel secret world

633,I’ve had this nightmare since I was a kid.,Dreams,"It’s nighttime, and I’m spending time with a family member. I tell them that I wanna show them something. I lead them to a window in my house and I say, “Just stare.” It’s pitch black outside and after some time of staring, a demonic face jump-scares me and my family member. 

That’s pretty much the gist of everything that happens. Sometimes it’s a different window, sometimes it’s a different family member. Sometimes it’s two faces instead of one. I don’t exactly know why this has haunted me for over a decade, but last night was the most recent occurrence of the dream.

635,Did anyone try Lucid dreaming?,Dreams,"So I researched a bit on How to control dreams, the term ""Lucid dreaming"" popped up.
They say, it is the dream where you know you are in a dream and you have the ability to control it.
Sounds pretty awesome right?

I researched more, about how to get there...
Few of them were :
1. Having a dream journal
2. Asking yourself everytime, if you are in a dream and checking it normally as well, so once it becomes a habit, you will do it in Ur dreams as well and will realise that it actually is a dream(sounds confusing but they say it works)

And a few more that I don't remember of..

Please add more points and experiences...💫💫",0,anyone try lucid dreaming researched bit control dream term lucid dreaming popped say dream know dream ability control sound pretty awesome right researched get dream journal asking everytime dream checking normally well becomes habit ur dream well realise actually dream sound confusing say work remember please add point experience

The game had an intro where one chicken talks directly to the player about how crazy his other super skinny chicken buddy was. You reach your hand out to touch him and he pecks your hand. You drive around and explore getting points while the monkies close in around you(like a storm) and you had to drive into a hot air ballon to escape. I swear to god it was real. I even still knew how to play from my child hood and remembered how to unlock special karts in game. And the weird part was I remember saying while I was playing, so matter of factly, ‘this game is how they came up with rocket league.’ Bc the mechanics were similar but obviously not as smooth as this seemed to be an old game. I woke up still convinced it was a real game, remembering the map layout and how to get certain karts. But then it wore off as I realized it was just a dream.

I got on it and apparently at some points standing on certain parts would crush you with the ceiling if you were going up, while still being able to go through somehow. I had to move to avoid that going down maybe. But then going up I was worried that I would get crushed. I think I went up 2 floors, and I ended up on a platform in the middle of the train tracks. I had my leg out like I was trying to trip someone, and 2 people walked on it, and fell on the tracks and died. They didn't fall, it's kind of like they were thrown. There was some blood upon impact. I couldn't believe I killed 2 people, but in the end they were alive.

We'd had him for a while when we got another dog, Tilly, a small white dog who I really do have in real life.  One day the big dog telepathically showed me some clips of their lives before I got them.  The big dog had been a dog in a lab having experiments done on him.  I was shown the dog on the day we went to adopt him from the lab. He was lying on a table in a dark, scary room, and a small white dog was lying next to him.  We adopted the big dog and left the small dog to its fate.  This flashback is where I found out that the small dog had been Tilly.  I was absolutely devastated and so guilty to know that I had walked out of that terrible place and left my now beloved little dog to further years of torture.

644,I had a dream about a corn field a masked murder that looked like friday 13th and one of my fictional villains I wrote about. And well three clones that looked like Keanu Reeves and had the personality of Ron's Rats from Harry Potter. Clearly this is the cherry of the cake of all dreams I've had.,Dreams," 

Quick note I make a habbit of writing every dream I can remember in stories as long as I can piece every information together in a readable short story. As long as I can rember important details of course.


Also quick note the villian thing is I was writing a villian but somehow my subconscious made him look Jason with a tactical suit
Not something I wish I ever wanted to see ever.
But I did.

# The Cornfield 

The freeway was cold the wind I could feel bristle in my hair. The dark cold night was not lit with bright sparkling stars instead I could see grey clouds following me. I poked my thumbs on the screen of my phone waiting for texts to pop through the ding sound reassured me every time it occurred it felt comfortable. 

I was weary and I was cold. My jacket didn’t keep my warm and neither did my scarf. I tightened it up for the third time as my cold breath could be seen like a puff of white smoke leaving my lips. 

I tilted my head downwards to stare at the blank black screen of my phone as I kept poking at it. 

Once I was done I slid the phone back in my pocket and left my hand in there as if it would be taken away. 

My other hand was tilting my hat down to my forehead to hide it. I started to walk down the freeway again I had no reason to wait here, not a single soul would drive down this dead forsaken road. 

But here I am walking down this road the very road no one would dare to cross. I kept my fingers laced on my hat while my hair flew about in the wind. 

Having the entire road to myself I felt almost free but I still felt out of place walking here. 

There was nowhere else to go to not a city in sight or a town or a pub. Nothing. Just a long stretching road covered in dirt.

The further I walked out the worse my phones reception got and when it did go out I turned it off and was left with the cold darkness of the night around me.

I stood there in the middle of the road, in the middle of the dark. Nothing to be of any light and nothing to be of any guidance to any kind of civilization. 

Here I was on this road alone, yet a flash of light could be seen in the distance I peered down the road to see the flash of light which was moving down this very lonesome road.

I blinked several times to see if my mind was playing tricks on me, but there it is a flash of light moving on the road coming close to me.

When it came in to view yet so far away I could see the shape of a car. A car I thought?

When do cars ever drive on this forsaken closed off-road?

In fact, why did I even start walking on this road?

To be honest, I can’t answer that question myself.

So I blink at the car’s lights and I wonder if it was intentional but the headlights of the car blinked as well.

I couldn’t tell if the headlights actually blinked or if the driver just turned the lights on and off.

If it was an actually blink I may have gone mad.

Anyway, I was watching the car driving down this road for what seemed like an hour when it started to slow down as it came towards me.

Once the car had stopped right in front of me the lights were so bright I had to pull my hat down across my eyes to block the light out.

I heard the engine reeve for a moment and the sound of the door opening. Once I heard the door slam shut everything went pitch black until whoever was driving the car moved my hat back on my head.

I stepped back as I blinked for a moment. 

The person driving the car was wearing nothing but black and had a chainsaw for a hand. I held my hands up in defence and wanted to walk away but I was frozen in place.

“Who wha? Are you?” I asked but It felt like I had no idea how to speak.

The man I hoped was looking at me because he wore a mask on his face, I couldn’t tell if it was the Friday the 13th mask or some fictional mad man villain I had created somewhere else.

The man pointed his chainsaw hand at me and the sound of it-I just wanted to get the hell away from this guy than worry about the sound of the chainsaw so instead of listening to the chainsaw I sprinted for my life as if it was some kind of anime opening.

As I ran I kept turning my head back down this endless dark forsaken road to see the car was following me. 

Of course, it was, I mean why wouldn’t it? Right?

I kept sprinting down this road back to where I started instead of where I wanted to go. But I didn’t know where I was going in the first place so that could have been anywhere.

Yet the car was still following with the man with the chainsaw hand and the strange mask.

No sign of life still just an empty road, well except for me and the evil man driving in the car.

However.

In Fact, I mean, however.

The road that was supposed to be behind me before the man in the car that's now chasing me down this road I walked down earlier was no longer the same.

I was now running down a cornfield.

Great.

Of all places, it had to be a cornfield.

I checked my six to see if the man in the car was following and to my happy surprise he was not.

I had to wonder how far did I go off track to be at a cornfield and no longer have the man in the car following me?

It messed me up a fair bit.

So I decided to have a look around and yep to my conclusion it was a cornfield.

Now since I was chased by a man in a car and who had a chainsaw hand I had two options one I go in the cornfield and see where it takes me or two I find the road again and find civilization.

My last option which I decided not to include beforehand because that's was the option I picked.

I stood here. 

I stood right in front of the cornfield with the road behind me that seemed to end where the grass met and the border of the cornfield surrounded it.

Why was a road put here I wouldn’t have a clue.

So I stood there.

I kicked my feet on the ground as I stood there not moving a muscle forward or backwards or left or right.

Yet I saw the corn in the cornfield begin to shake and move in the wind. Not all of them only 3.

Yep, 3.

So I tilted my head to the right to get a closer look (Well it was not objectively as close as I wanted to be but it’s as staying in one spot good) and yes I saw the corn move.

Then I saw three heads pop out of the corns as if they too were running from something.

I stepped back yet again, this time breaking the rule I had in place which was never moving from this spot.

Damn it I thought.

Well since I moved from this spot I might as well wave at the people in the corn.

I waved at them. 

They waved back.

We all stared at each other not even sure what to do. Until the three people got out of the corn wearing winter clothing the same as me except one of them was wearing a dress and no scarf. 

All three of them started beckoning me to follow them so for a moment I did, I walked over towards them hiding in the corn.

But before I could even cross over I banged my knee on a fence. 

I could clearly see the corn wedged in between the fence as if the corn was grown on the fence itself.

So I decided to walk away from the fence while the three people were clearly trying to get my attention I shrugged my shoulders.

“You need to hide, the killer on the loose,” One of them said while as if their body danced like a mime.

I looked back and forth and thought to myself maybe my odds of survival were better elsewhere.

I mean it a cornfield right? Right?

At this point, I stood there again and said nothing and did nothing. 

So I went oh well and headed out to the highway once more.

But wait, how I can even go back on the highway when I was clearly at a cornfield for one moment?

At this point, I don’t even question what going because everything changing so quickly it ridiculous and I can’t even care.

So now I’m back on the highway after I watched the three strange people hop themselves back into the cornfield possibly to there deaths.

As I trudge down this lonely highway I decided not to think about anything on my way down.

Quite frankly there was not much to think about at all.

But I felt like my walk on the highway was over, as I felt my entire body sink into through the highway and the world began to change like a pop-up book returning me home.

I fell back on my couch to relax knowing the day was over but I turned my head to my right to see three strange-looking clones of myself all sitting cramped on the one part of the couch.

In Fact, they kind of reminded me of Keanu Reeves and Ron's Rat?

Clearly whoever designed these clones did not even think about what would happen when putting two and together, eh?

Oh well, I was no sitting on my couch with three clones all biting each other like rats and quite possibly safe from a strange killer and a cornfield too.",0,dream corn field masked murder looked like

646,Dream of walking aimlessly,Dreams,"I had a very pleasant little dream last night, and thought i would share

It all started with me in the middle of walking down a gravel road in the middle of two farm fields which where skirted by the forest. Seemingly in the middle of no where. I could feel the cool breeze, and noticed the beautifully clear sky. Jogging down the road I found that I didn't tire at all. Slowing down to a walk as pickup truck passed down the road coming from the tree line ahead. 


Walking down the gravel road and around the corner through the tree line i could see that the road ended at a small farm just on the other side. Turning around i walked back through the tree line and off the road to follow the trees for a moment, before walking through the tree line to go through the far side of the yard that sat in front of the house. Almost like i was worried about running into someone. Making it to the far side of the yard there was a creek which a rather odd stone bridge crossing it. 


Making it to the other side there was another small portion of the yard before it was yet again cut off by a creek. Stopping for a moment i wondered how i was going to cross this one seeing as it had no bridge. A log which laid halfway across the creek had caught my eye tho. Sprinting across the log to the end. I leapt across the remainder of the water, Grabbing a hold of the bank to pull myself up onto it. 


Standing up on the other side i glanced out at the open fields ahead. There where rolling hills for as far as the eye could see
bordered on one side by a shear cliff and a what looked like a ocean. It was all remarkably beautiful, and calm, But unfortunately that was where the dream ended.

647,A sad dream,Dreams,"Last night, I had the 2nd saddest dream of my entire life. 

I’ll share a bit of background info to set it up because storytelling is not my forte. I’m a shy but fun-loving 39 yr old woman with an amazing husband and 2 wonderful kids. My husband is a classic extrovert. He’s smart, funny, and very easygoing. Nothing ever seems to bother him too much. We have a tight-knit circle of close friends and we’re both blessed to have lots of extended family nearby. I’m a social worker / school-based mental health therapist. I work with at-risk urban youth and I absolutely love my job. 

Life is really great. Better than I ever imagined. But I struggle with generalized anxiety disorder and PTSD due to childhood trauma. I occasionally ruminate about unrealistic worries. Over the years, I’ve adopted lots of helpful coping skills, but all that I’ve learned is totally useless when I’m asleep, lol.

I hope no one makes fun of me or picks apart my grammar, but it’s a risk I’m willing to take in order to get this off my chest (and hopefully out of my brain), since I’d rather not share this dream with people I know (not counting my husband, because I tell him everything). Ok, here goes.

I dreamed I was driving home alone after having been out with my mom and my 23 yr old little sister for several hours at a fun family event. My husband had unfortunately worked late and wasn’t able to make it on time, but I had been expecting him to swing by whenever he could. Our 2 young kids were with him; idk why. Well, he never did show up, so I was disappointed and a little annoyed.

When I got home, there were like 200 people inside my house having a massive party. It was like something out of a movie. People were packed in almost shoulder to shoulder. The music was loud and distorted like the speakers were blown, but it was somehow soft and inviting at the same time. The song that was playing was slow and romantic. It felt familiar. A handful of couples were dancing, some people were mingling, but most people were just sitting around talking. Everyone was drunk.

I could barely see through the smoky haze, but I noticed right away that some of the pictures on the wall had been knocked crooked, there was a broken vase with its water and flowers spilled out onto the coffee table, and there were more than a few empty bottles and cans strewn around the room.

As I looked around, I was struck by one couple in particular, whom I did not know. They were slow dancing together and the lady’s eyes were closed, her head resting lovingly on her man’s chest as they swayed back and forth. It was a beautiful thing to see this couple in such a warm embrace, so at peace in each other’s arms that they seemed oblivious to the noise and chaos around them. I was transfixed for a moment, but then some guy off to the side somewhere laughed heartily and I snapped back into the confusing reality of the whole scene. I was like, what the hell?? I wasn’t mad, just bewildered.

I squeezed my way through all the people, looking for my husband. I found him outside on the back deck, laughing and talking with some of our friends and neighbors. Out in the yard, there was an awesome bonfire going and probably 50 more people milling around. Everyone was having a good time. 

I asked my husband what the heck was going on and he said he had been too tired after work to meet up with me, so he went home and had a beer out on the deck. A neighbor had leaned over the fence and started chatting with him, so he invited the guy over for a quick beer. That guy told someone else, who told someone else, and word spread until entire families started showing up. The other people on the deck laughed and told me that my husband had just kept saying, “the more the merrier”, and that he hadn’t realized things had gotten so out of control inside.

I was like, ok...um, still weird, but whatever, and I decided I’d better check on our kids, who are 9 & 10. 

I pushed my way back through the people, searching for my kids. I’m short, and everyone was taller than me, so once I merged into the crowd, all I could see was the people directly surrounding me. So many torsos and feet! No one seemed to hear me repeatedly saying excuse me, no one was kindly moving aside for me, and no one inside the house even knew who I was. I was starting to feel frustrated and anxious.

I found our kids in the basement with about 25 other children all happily eating popcorn and pizza, quietly watching a movie. There were no drunkards in there with them, so that was good.

Here’s where it gets odd...

I looked up and saw 2 garlic cups stuck to the ceiling. (You know, that buttery liquid goodness that comes with pizza sometimes...) Anyway, they had been opened, so in those 2 places, the ceiling was a greasy, drippy mess. Little splotches of the stuff were soaking into the carpet.

That’s when I got mad. I stormed through the crowd, back out to my husband. I asked him how in the heck that mess happened downstairs and why wasn’t he doing a better job of watching both the kids and the drunks. He slapped his knee and only said, “Oh yeah, the garlic!” before he doubled over with laughter. He was laughing so hard he couldn’t even speak, so I left in a huff and went back downstairs to our kids. Each time I had to plow my way through that dense mass of stumbling bodies just to walk through my own home, I grew more and more irritated.

When I asked my kids about the messy ceiling, my son shrugged and said he hadn’t noticed til I pointed it out. My daughter said, “I dunno, Daddy stuck them up there with crayon wax.”

I started shoving my way through the crowd yet again, heading out to my husband for the third time, fully prepared to give him a piece of my mind... But when I reached an open space in the kitchen, I saw him through the glass patio doors and he just looked so happy that all I could think was how much I love him and how it warms my heart to see him having a nice time. I no longer cared about the garlic cups or the broken vase, etc. It was all worth it to see him smile.

But then it was like someone flipped a switch in my brain and it suddenly hit me at that moment, the stark realization that he hadn’t texted or called me at all during the past few hours and that he’d basically been having fun with the whole town except me. I was so hurt. I didn’t mind the party or begrudge him his fun, I was just devastated that I hadn’t been included. He could’ve called to say hey, there’s been a change of plans or he could’ve at least texted to give me a heads up that we had company over, or something... anything... It was like I hadn’t even crossed his mind. I thought to myself, this means I’m not his best friend like I thought I was.

I walked slowly back across the kitchen with my head down as I thought, well that’s it, I’m not his best friend and I never will be, so I have to leave him. I wanted our relationship to be everything I thought it was or nothing at all. My heart was broken.

I stopped the music and made all the guests leave. Everybody was mad at me for spoiling the fun. The adults glared at me and made snarky comments as they shuffled out. The bigger kids called me mean and the little ones cried. I felt terrible. Some people refused to leave and some were almost too drunk to move. I had to threaten to call the police to get the stragglers out. It was super stressful and the emotional turmoil of it all was physically exhausting.

And that’s it. I woke up to find that I had been crying into my pillow.

On the bright side, I think I know where almost all of it was coming from... They say dreams are the brain’s way of processing real-life events, and I believe it.

So, first of all, I’ve been craving pizza like crazy. We usually have pizza every Friday during our family movie night, but due to extenuating circumstances, we didn’t have pizza (or a movie) the past two weekends. Then yesterday, the school I work at ordered pizza for lunch, but I missed it because I had a student in crisis. Last night, we didn’t have pizza either because the kids and I went to my mom’s to celebrate my sister’s birthday. My husband worked late, as he often does, so he couldn’t go with us. I really did expect him to swing by sometime, but he didn’t. He was tired and went straight home. (No beers though, lol.)

Secondly, we have recently moved from one town to an adjacent town. My husband bowls on a league in our former town, as he has for close to 20 years now. After bowling each Wednesday, he used to grab a beer with his teammates at a local bar. Well, our move has added 15 minutes to his drive time, so although he continues to bowl there, he has stopped going to that bar. Instead, he meets up with some of his other buddies at a bar that’s like 2 minutes from our new house. For the past 3 or 4 weeks, he’s texted me from the bar saying sweet things... telling me he misses me, that we should get a babysitter sometimes so I can be there with him, and that it will be nice when the kids are old enough to stay home alone so I can join him whenever I want, etc. So I know we’re good and I have nothing to worry about, but anxiety is not a logical beast...

My biggest fear in real life is not losing him to another woman or anything else that most wives worry about. The scariest thing to me is the thought of staying married and still being deeply in love with one another but losing our friendship.

I mean, don’t get me wrong. It’s totally awesome being husband and wife, and it still blows my mind when I stop and consider that he and I have created 2 new humans as if out of thin air! It’s beyond heartwarming to know that their existence is a direct product of our love. But more so than anything else, I cherish the fact that we’re best friends on top of it all. That’s the icing on the cake.

I know full well that a relationship like ours is a rare and beautiful thing, and that we should appreciate every day we have together and never take each other for granted. And therein lies the problem. It makes my heart so full and happy that I can’t help but worry that someday, when I least expect it, something may go wrong. Like it’s too good to be true. Like the easier it is or the more perfect it all seems, the less likely it is to last.

Awake me knows though, that we’ve got a good thing going and that anxiety is a damned dirty liar. We’ve been married for 11 years now and we were together 6 years before that. (That’s how long it took me to convince myself that getting married wasn’t going to jinx us.)

So there you have it. A dream about everything and nothing all at once. A little about pizza, a little about love, and a lot about fear.

(I told my husband about this dream while he was shopping online for accessory parts for his new truck. When I finished, he smiled at me and said, “Aww, babe. You know I love you and I always want you around. You’ll always be my best friend. Look at this trailer hitch cover.” LMAO)",0,sad dream last night nd saddest dream entire life share bit background info set storytelling forte shy fun loving yr old woman amazing husband wonderful kid

Skip forward a few hours irl, and there's this man. He looks into a hole going into the sea (for some reason) and I'm in the hole. He pushes me down but not intentionally. He says something along the lines of ""they come from the sea, ha"" and I'm sliding down the hole at this point. I'm scared, so in the dream I suddenly say ""I need to wake up"" and I do. Then I fall back asleep and I'm in a warehouse-type place. A guy tries to open the doors and he breaks in. Then I wake up. For good.

653,Apocalypse dream,Dreams,"Last night I had a dream that everyone was getting “taken.” Like dragged away out of nowhere and disappearing. So the rest of the humans left are going kind of insane, it kind of reminded me of The Purge or Blood Diamond. All the people left have just gone nuts and are cruising around in jeeps doing horrible things. The other more sane people are just hiding. 
So I’m hiding for what feels like DAYS in this random persons closet in a house. They have a pantry in the house with non perishables in it, so I occasionally leave the closet to get some food, then go back to hide. The time comes where I need girl stuff- so I leave the house to go find my supplies.
I’m walking in the streets as quietly as possible - I’m horrified. As the houses get nicer and nicer, I find myself in a very expensive looking neighborhood. I come up to a church and peek inside a window. There are numerous dining tables set up. The place is in perfect condition. Suddenly this super dark feeling comes over me, and for some reason I KNOW this is the place where the elite, or Illuminati, is meeting during this weird time. No one enters this building because they are the leaders of everyone left here. Horrible things happen here, and I need to leave. 
Then this voice comes into my head, and I’m either having a conversation with an angel, or God himself, and he tells me- “Someone is going to come and take you now. And you need to let them.”
So then I’m walking back to the house with my closet because idk wtf I’m supposed to be doing and I’m scared. 
As predicted, this person comes up and puts a bag over my head and I pass out. 
Next thing I know, I wake up in a space ship, buckled into a seat. I’m surrounded by people in space suits. The main astronaut explains to me that they have been gathering only the “right” people, to bring them up to the new community on Mars. This is where they are taking me.
Then the space ship TAKES OFF, and I literally experience the most realistic take off possible. I’m shoved to the back of my seat, shaking for several minutes, until finally I can see out the window that Earth is under our feet. 
Then I wake up. 

I’m sure that there’s a lot of symbolism I’m supposed to be dissecting, since that dream was a play out of when God comes for all the holy people, and all of the bad people are left to try to sort themselves out- but honestly I am so impressed with my brain’s ability to create a space ship launch, and what seemed like a genuine week worth of events, even though it was probably only 90 mins.

Last night I dreamed of being in my home city, then all of a sudden 6-8 triangular UFOs appeared on the sky, stood there for a short time, formed a circle then went away. After that, all some people could do was ask questions, at first it was nothing unusual as I didn't know the people in the dream and they asked me questions about the city and stuff. As time progressed, more and more people had a look in their eyes like they were lost, detached from their minds, asking questions which I do not remember, but I remember them making me feel uncomfortable. Then I realized that this was a part of the alien plan to conquer Earth by learning about it by infecting people, making them ask questions about it and just know everything they needed to know before the invasion begins.

661,Help With a Recurring Dream,Dreams,"Been having the same basic recurring dream each night for MONTHS now and I don't understand it. I'm always in a huge old mansion with my husband and something happens that makes me anxious (i.e. someone is mad at me, my mother shows up, etc.) and I run upstairs to find a hallway of nothing but bedrooms. I somehow know that they are all vacant and I can choose any one I want. Sometimes my husband is with me and he goes into the one I choose. 

As soon as I/we (depending on the dream) enter the bedroom I choose, we are fine. It's relaxed and calm but I'm still lowkey nervous the person mad at me will figure out which room I hid in.

A LOT of my other dreams over the years also revolved around having more than one bedroom or home to choose from, not sure why.

662,Being a passenger in a teen's car,Dreams,"I've had two dreams back to back where I am a passenger in a teen girl's car, sitting in the back right passenger seat. I sense a feeling of unease while in this situation; I am sitting there wondering why I am in the car and wonder who the driver is. The drivers were respectively black and white teenage girls enjoying the privilege of transporting me, maybe for the first time. Who knows. I can only go with the nonverbal cues they gave since there was no audible speech from them. The black girl grasped the stirring wheel so earnestly and tightly upon realizing I was her 30 something year old white male passenger.  She gave me a grimacing expression while looking back at me after picking me up for whatever reason. The white girl was more oblivious and indifferent to me and I was more stressed because she was driving while texting! I don't know why I didn't say anything but I was fuming over that observation. I may have said something but I was ignored; the ear buds and the phone distracted her too much to care about me, her passenger. At least there was no accident. 

Who knows what this means and I am open to feedback that is out there. Did any of you have dreams of being passengers in stranger's cars? I cannot be the only one. If so, I guess I am unique.",0,passenger teen car two dream back back passenger teen girl car sitting back right passenger seat sense feeling unease situation sitting wondering car wonder driver driver respectively black white teenage girl enjoying privilege transporting maybe first time know go nonverbal cue gave since audible speech black girl grasped stirring wheel earnestly tightly upon realizing something year old white male passenger gave grimacing expression looking back picking whatever reason white girl oblivious indifferent stressed driving texting know say anything fuming observation may said something ignored ear bud phone distracted much care passenger least accident know mean open feedback dream passenger stranger car cannot one guess unique

664,The most vivid dream I’ve ever had and scared about it again,Dreams,"Not sure if this is the right place to post but here goes, I need to get these thoughts out there.

This happened several years ago but I still think about it often. I had found my brother’s body after he shot himself. We hadn’t been able to get ahold of him for a few days and he had just broken up with a girlfriend. It felt so real- the circumstances, visual details of the gore, eerie silence after entering his home, and especially the smell of his decomposing body that I couldn’t shake even after waking up. 

My brother is not the most mentally stable. I’ve always been so scared this dream was somehow prophetic just because of how different it was compared to the nonsensical nature of my usual dreams.

667,I think I believe in the afterlife from a dream,Dreams,"I had a dream 6 years after a good friend’s suicide that I met up with him. We were in our early 20s when he died and it was traumatizing to say the least. It was the day I lost my innocence for sure, I was changed. Around the time we had both started dating people and had gone off on our own paths but he was someone I bonded with like a soulmate, but not romantically.  He was someone who I always needed to check on, needed to ask about and whose presence I needed even if we weren’t physically together. When he died his absence was tremendous and although it gets easier to talk about and feel, ill never be “over” it. 

One night I had a dream that we were together in a house I didn’t recognize. He came for me and told me he was ok, and that no one could have changed what happened and that he was sorry. He listened to me as I cried and held me for a while, and kissed me sweetly when he left, the way you’d comfort a close family or friend when they were grieving. I woke up and felt a release of all the grief and sobbed all the way to work, on every break and on my way home. I’m sobbing while I write this. The dream was so real that years later I really still believe we might have met up somewhere. 

I’ve never told anyone in fear of sounding crazy but the way it felt didn’t feel the same as when my dreams say what I want to hear to pacify me.    Has anyone else ever experienced this?

668,"Dream number VI. Shitty elevators, Pizza shops called ""subway"" and More Monsters.... I have a weird brain.",Dreams,"My friend and I got tickets to go see a hardcore band. We were staying on the second floor of the hotel, first few times we used the elevator it was all sweet, but when I took it alone my “I support Australian seabird rescue” shirt got stuck in the bottom of the door and was being sucked in dragging me forward with it. Luckily the elevator dinged signaling it had reached the second floor, but it had only made it half way. I pulled my shirt out, but that made the elevator sink down past the floor and blocked my exit……. So, I just clicked the button and went down. Three people came in and they were looking at me very weirdly so I explained what happened but I don't think they cared. 

The elevator took us to the roof of the building, and now we were all standing on the four corners of this wooden cube frame that was built on top of the elevator. I wanted the get down but the others are just chatting and having fun. No one was listening so I got off alone, but my side started to fall and I tried calling out but they’re still not listening so I thought ‘fuck it’ and went back to my room to get ready. Everyone was starting to line up to go so we got our tickets and joined the line. I remember standing in line and watching as the frame thing on top of the building collapse and thought those four people must have died….

Then I got a job working as a Nany, the kids were pretty cute, and their dad worked at a little pizza shop called “subway”. I got a Hawaiian pizza but anther worker came in and stole it. Then the mum came and said I was not right for the job cause the son was telling bullshit lies. He tried to stop me as i left but it was way too late… and I think I left them to be eaten by the monster, dunno maybe not.

We worked at a construction site now. There were monsters so I was getting people to stay in the light where you’re safe (think doctor who – the library). If any part of your body was in darkness they would latch onto you and drain all of the energy and flesh from your body leaving you a skeleton. There was a sexy lady that I saved and that night while we were tryna sleep the workers were all having a party so she went over to tell them to shut up, but I remembered the monster was a thing so I chased after her to help. Some dude signed me into the party and he was being a bit of a dick but I still wanted to save him, so I told him to jump from the balcony into the light below – which he did. So, he was safe but now I didn’t have anywhere to hide. 

I was waiting for death with my eyes closed but luckily the lady turned on all the lights! She saved me! I opened my eyes to thank her but...

669,Warning,Dreams,"A group of policeboys have been assembled to form a squad. Something big is about to happen.
The dream starts with these policeboys, me being one of them, standing, not in any particular fashion, in square cul de sac. One of the walls is covered with black and yellow striped strips. 
The objective of our call to arms is yet unknown. But as it is a part of our job to go wherever we are called, there's not much choice either. The mood of the place is jovial. Most of the boys are upto random shenanigans.
Tired of waiting I arrange for a football and call out whoever wants to play can come. Not that I needed to. Seeing a football these boys run towards it like a dog.
We must have played for a while for the next thing I remember we are standing in another part of town. 
A larger, a square, one of those places which are usually the central heart of the city. More policemen. Disruptive disturbance among them. A growing restlessness. The boys want to know. At this point the crowd has grown to a substantial number. A crowd of policeboys. With weapons but no aim. 
I am standing in front of this crowd, at a small distance from them with a few other people.
Suddenly, almost at cue one of the boys standing with me loses it and starts shouting hysterically. He knew all along. Just didn't want to break anyone. With a large stick dabbed in red paint at one end he chants repeatedly while painting the three numbers on the road. 
'9/11 IS ABOUT TO HAPPEN!'
'9/11 IS ABOUT TO HAPPEN!!'
'9/11 IS ABOUT TO HAPPEN!!!'

Looking at the way that we were assembled and how great in numbers we were, the crowd perhaps expected something of this sort for there wasn't as big of a shock. It was as if we knew the meaning of 9/11. As if it had happened before. Somewhere in between I also got the insight that government had killed Osama bin Laden and now his son was hell bent on getting his revenge. 

Next thing you know, we are in a large room with wooden benches and a whiteboard on one wall. The room is packed with loud policeboys. A plan of action is needed. No one here knows what to do. 
Enter chief.
Not helpful chief. Just chief.
He tries to calm us. Reminds us of our true objective. After settling everyone down he asks us our opinion of what we can do. We start talking and soon it gets to the point where the chief asks who broke out the 'rumor' in the first place. A boy (an old school friend) gets up and tells the chief it was him. Silently I whisper in his ear from behind 'I knew even before you.'
Chiefs expression's are grave but he stays calm. He confirms the rumors and lets us know now that this time it, whatever it is, will be much, much bigger. The boys have lost all of their remaining patience. They want to save their lives now. 

Suddenly the ceiling panel starts shaking violently. Someone is trying to get in through the roof. 
Run.
Chief was the first one out of the door. A couple of boys ahead of me, I grab my bag as I exit the room. The strap gets stuck in the staircase handrail while I'm running too but immediately it is freed too.
 The passage was divided into two ways where the staircase ended. Everyone was going right. I saw only one lonely figure going left and I run after him. He slips into one room in line of many, in a long corridor. I try to get into another but as I reach for the door handle, boom.

678,Trapped in the land of the dead,Dreams,"I'm nineteen years old. I'm running through a razed city. Buildings are on fire, the streets are a mess, smoke rises into the air and makes it hard to breathe or see. It's something like a warzone. I don't know what I'm running from, but I am absolutely terrified. I know if it catches me that I'm done for.
There are a few other people running with me. I don't know any of them. 
We make it to this compound surrounded by a tall chainlink fence topped with barbed wire, but the gate has been busted open. One side of the gate is lying on the ground, completely torn off its hinges, the other kind of hangs there.
Inside the compound we find a helicopter, and one of the other survivors claims he knows how to fly. He starts it up, and we all try to scramble in. The thing is there isn't enough room for all of us. Laying close by is a rope. I volunteer to tie myself on to the landing skis of the helicopter, and we take flight.
We have escaped. Relief fills my mind even though I'm dangling by a rope. 
I can see the city in ruins. Everything is ablaze. Explosions erupt from buildings. I feel terrible for those that didn't make it out.
Suddenly, I hear an alarm going off from above me. I look up, and see the engine of the helicopter is smoking, and the rotor stalls.
We drop.
I remember the gut-wrenching feeling of weightlessness and terror as I fall still harnessed to the heli.
The ground rushes up so fast.
I don't feel the impact as everything goes black.
I wake up in a panic and try to take a deep breath, but I inhale sand instead of air. It tears at the inside of my nostrils and fills my mouth. I cough it out, and vomit a little as I pull myself out of a sand dune. 
I kneel there, and blast sandy snot rockets out of my nose, and spit sand out of my mouth.
I look around in awe at a massive, hot desert.
I realise I am dead as I remember the helicopter crash. Is this heaven? Hell, perhaps? Some kind of afterlife I have earned or been punished to during my years alive.
I stand up. The desert is hot, and I can see the shimmer of heat as I look out upon my surroundings. I start to walk, aimlessly.
I notice how I'm not sweating, or thirsty, or tired, even though the place I am in seems so unforgiving. It's confusing, but reassuring. I know for sure this is death.
I walk and walk. Up and over massive dunes, then down the other side. Time and time again. Nothing but sand. 
I walked for 2 days and nights. Going somewhere. Going nowhere. Just going. Sometime during the third day i see a figure in the distance, also walking on the dunes.
I start to shout and run toward it. As I get closer I can see that they are walking in my direction. They are dressed in a dark brown cloak. A hood covers their head and creates a dark shadow that obscures their face. A long, white beard is the only discernible feature I can see.
As I reach this man he remains calm.
I am overjoyed to meet another person in this desert.
I ask where I am, and where I should go.
He responds ""You're lucky I've found you instead of them. But, I know they already know you are here. We don't have time to waste, as they will not be kind if they find you. Come. We have a ways to go yet.""
""What?"" I say, ""What the hell does that mean?""
He turns and begins walking back in the direction he came from without explanation.
I stand there in disbelief, but decide to follow as he meanders his way through the sand. 
Again I walk for days, but now with a silent guide.
Eventually we come upon a giant city, with a massive stone wall fortifying it. It has to be about one hundred feet tall, and spans unending into either horizon. 
We walk to the wall, and then alongside it for a while, coming to a wooden double door set in it.
He stops and turns to me, ""From here you must stay close to me. Don't touch anything, and DON'T talk to anyone! Understand?""
I nod. 
He knocks on the door, and a ramshackle guard of sorts opens one of the doors. He looks at the old guide, then at me, snorts, and lets us in.
 The guard is not human. I've never seen anything like this creature before. Almost orcish looking, but hairy. Giant yellow tusks point upward out of its mouth. 
We walk past it, and into a bazaar.
There are beings everywhere. Some human, most are not. Aliens. Monsters. Whatever you'd like to call them. Coexisting. Trying to sell goods and wares. Haggling. Shouting. Laughing. It's all so surreal. 
I follow my guide in disbelief, trying not to stare at any of the creatures who are not paying any attention to us. 
We pass by a stand selling some kind of fruit, the likes of which I've never seen. I stop and pick one up, it seems like it would be delicious. The fruit seller says something to me in a foreign language. I look at it, and shrug.
Suddenly someone grabs my arm forcefully and shouts, ""I told you not to touch anything!""
I drop the fruit into the stand it came from, and am pulled away by my guide.
We make our way through, and out of this giant market into streets that are less bustling. 
It seems like a residential area.
Small mud and stone houses line the alleys, and fewer beings are hanging about.
We stop at one of the huts, and my guide pulls out a ring full of old, iron keys. He finds one amongst the many, and slides it into the keyhole of the wooden door and unlocks it. As he opens the door he turns to me and says, ""I'm sorry, but this is all I can do for you. You must do the rest.""
Then he grabs me by the shoulders and forces me into the small hut. 
I don't have time to protest or ask why before the door closes behind me and I hear the door lock again. 
Scrambling at the knob, I try to open the door and release myself. It's no use, I am trapped, and once again alone.
I begin crying uncontrollably. I feel so ashamed and angry for having been fooled. I slam my fists against the door and shout as tears continue to stream down my face. 
I collapse into the door and slide down to the ground, sobbing.
I lay there for a while feeling utterly defeated and betrayed. 
By this time my eyes have adjusted to the darkness of my prison as a little light creeps its way around the wooden door and through the few small cracks in it.
To my right is a small bed, with a tattered, old blanket on it. The wall opposite the door has a small dresser and a big, round shape draped with a white sheet.
I don't bother getting up, but instead just slump back down on the ground and begin to cry again.
I cry myself to sleep on the cold, dusty floor.
When I wake up the room is dark. No sunlight creeps through the door, and I assume it is night. I pick myself up off the floor and shuffle to where I remember the bed being. Slowly, I lower myself onto it, and drift off again.
I awake to see the light once again shines through the door, and come to remember I am trapped in this room. More tears and sorrow. 
This is my life for a few days.
On the fourth day I decide I should keep track of the time I spend here, so I scratch four lines into the wall above my bed. I assume I'll spend the rest of eternity here as penance for something I did in the Land of the Living. But I don't know what it was, as I kniw I lived a rather mundane, and non-violent life.
Day eight: I open the three drawers of the dresser to find they contain nothing, and I finally remove the sheet from the round shape next to the dresser. It's a big vanity mirror. For the first time in 8 days I see my own reflection. I look exactly how I remembered myself looking the last time I peered into a mirror.
I sit down in front of the mirror and just stare at my own reflection. I talk to myself, and try to assure myself I will be okay, and things will work out the way they are meant to.
The next day, I sit infront of the mirror, and I decide to meditate. I clear my mind, and try to attain peace. 
It takes a few weeks, but eventually I reach a state of stillness.
I continue this ritual every day.
Day 783: I have a hard time maintaining my stillness for some reason. I can't figure out why.  So I open my eyes, and notice that the mirror in front of me is different somehow. I reach out to touch it and my reflection begins to ripple.
The ripples grow in size and then calm, revealing a reflection that is not my own.
I can see a young woman, about sixteen or seventeen years old, sitting at a desk applying mascara. She is beautiful. I assume she is getting ready to go out sonewhere.
I know this is my chance.
I slowly reach toward the mirror, and feel fear as my hand slips through the glass. I notice her expression change to fear as well as I make my way through this portal of sorts. I climb out onto her desk and free myself from the solitude I had been confined to. She stares up at me and begins to scream. 
I wake up in my own bed, and inhale my the deepest breath I have ever taken. I am alive again. 
I'll never forget her face, or let go of the guilt I feel for causing such trauma to someone. I still think about her from time to time. I wonder if I'll ever get to meet her again. Is she even still alive? Why was she vital in my resurrection?

679,"I Had This Dream A Few Months Ago, It’s Hilarious But I Have No Clue What It Means:",Dreams,"So the night I had this dream I had what I believe were three separate dreams. The first one wasn’t relevant but then the last two were connected, so here it is. 

Dream One:

So I got a text from my friend, Pierre, who sent a text saying “come to the German teacher’s house.” Me: “Why?” Pierre: “Just come here.” So I got to the house, which in real life is my grandparents house. I open the door into the cold, dark, kitchen and see Pierre standing there. All around him are multiple guitars, each with triangle pieces cut out of them. As I turn to leave, the German teacher walks in with his groceries. While I’m walking away I turn and see him step into the house, freeze, and drop all the bags on the ground. 

Dream Two:

I’m in my high school with a group of mostly friends. It’s night out, and all lights in the school are out. No light except for a few red emergency lights. Then, my biology teacher comes over the P.A. And says “Come to the game room.” In real life, this section of the school is a staircase though in the dream it was a solid wall. A small staircase appeared which led to a room higher up in the wall. Me and the group all headed in. Inside there was a TV hooked up to an Xbox, a long leather couch that went almost the entirety of the room, and my bio teacher in a wooden chair. “You will each play this game one by one.” he says. We all sit down and he goes through the line. He finally gets to Pierre, who’s sitting next to me. As Pierre gets up a day “oh yeah, Pierre, what were you doing at the German teacher’s house?” He’s standing in front of me. He turns to face me, puts his hand up to his mouth, and proceeds to spit up the wooden guitar triangles from earlier. He then places them in my lap and goes to play the video game.

So yeah it was weird. The weirdest dream I’ve ever had. My and my friends always have a good laugh whenever I tell the story. Was wondering if anyone could find a deep meaning at all.

681,I had a dream about fighting ghosts while being a ghost,Dreams,"So at the start of the dream, I’m hanging out with my friends in some random neighborhood. At one point we go into this Forrest and find a gun. So I take the gun, call the police, and give it to them.

That part really has nothing to do with the rest of the dream

So after that I go to a dinner party with a bunch of my friends. But this dinner party is at this house, that feels like belongs to all of us at once. I don’t know how to describe it, but let’s move on.

So we’re all sitting at this table eating, and all of a sudden this ghost comes in. This ghost was like clear and you could see through him, he kinda looked like high five ghost, just with two arms in their correct positions instead of one. This ghost isn’t being scary or anything, but he’s being like annoying and asking us for food.

So one of my friends walks up to this Frame on the wall, and the frame has like a cut out piece of a quilt or blanket. The cloth had a little design on it, it was a diamond, with four more diamond in it. And they were each a color, red, green, blue, and yellows.
 
This guy touches the blanket and turns into a ghost, and beats up the other ghost. And everyone’s like cheering him on. But as my friends beating up the annoying ghost, more of that ghosts buddy’s come in.  Now there are like four or five annoying ghosts, and my friend explains to us that the only way to fight ghosts, is to touch the blanket to change into a ghost.

So I decide to turn into a ghost, and I help my buddy out. So we keep fighting these ghosts, but more keep coming. And as more keep coming, more friends turn into ghost form to help us fight. And for some reason, this all had a like comedic vibe to it. 

So eventually my friends and I are outnumbered by the ghosts, and all of a sudden, one of my friends touches the blanket a second time. This takes my friends and I, and like locks our souls in the blanket. So we all become the blanket, and then all the ghosts we we’re fighting just explode.

683,Same dream for months,Dreams,"Every night I have the exact same dream with a variation at certain parts. It either takes place in a church basement, my school gym, or the cafeteria. I'm there chilling out with my friends and other random people that go to my school when suddenly a group of people busts in (7-20 people) and starts threatening everyone. Sometimes the group is armed with guns, other times knives, and rarely, nothing. They always have the intent of killing everyone but sometimes ""mess around first"" by injuring me in many different painful ways. By this point, the dream starts constantly switching between third and first person every few seconds. Either I get up from the torture or emerge from the crowd to fight them and I always succeed at stopping them, most the time without killing them. Very very rarely kill them in the dream and when I do it's always by biting or ripping them apart. I rarely emerge unscathed, most of the time I am either critically injured or die. No matter what happens the police come in and secure the area after this. If I was critically injured, I always tell my friends that I may die and what to do if that happens. The dream then goes to me learning how to live the rest of my life with the injury. If I die, I bleed out slowly and offer my friends some last tips of advice and give them all letters containing personal messages for them.

No matter what the dream ends on a positive note, as I feel fulfilled that I protected my friends, even if it cost me my life.

I don't know where this one starts or ends but I'm walking through a very large mansion. 
I have the feeling I'm there to babysit the children, or otherwise am maybe their father or something...

I walk through a very large long dining hall to a kitchen, to the side I see and notice two kids playing in water or something
and making a mess. I am at first concerned they are special needs or something, but then a woman later comforts me that they're fine.

I end up in the kitchen and focus heavily with my full field of vision on a whiteboard/magnetboard on the fridge. I don't know if anything is
written on it, but there is a blue LCD/LED like clock in the upper left, all one piece, with no black square for the digits, they are just
more illuminated than the body of the clock.

There are magnets on other corners of the board, and then I see the aforementioned woman for the first time. She doesn't talk that I recall
but assures me the kids are ok.

689,Best friend dog bit me.,Dreams,"The dream goes like this... One of my childhood best friends came to my house to pick me up and we went outside in a park, he was in a very good mood as usual. When we got to the park he started arguing with me that I'm always silent and I only come out with him to meet new people around him.(or something from this nature). We have a very good and honest relationship in real life. This part kinda makes sense because I'm not a very social person.

I went and sat on a distant bench because I felt bad, he later came and asked me if I want something to eat or if I want cigarettes because he was going to the shop. I said that I'm going home, he said ""do as you wish"" and turned his back.

I got up from the bench and started looking for my flip flops. I forgot to mention I left my house with my house flip flops 😂 and during the dream I left them on one of the slides. I found them, got down from the slide and his little dog came running and barking at me. He got me by the index finger of my right hand and started growling and biting. I was not scared, I was looking the dog dead In his eyes without moving, not even blinking(I am not scared of dogs I've had a couple of pitbulls, I've also been bit numerous times.). He let go, and went and bit me again. The second time I grabbed him with my other hand by the top jaw and started squeezing until he squeaked and ran away. There was no blood, the dog wasn't biting with his full force.

All of a sudden my best friend's girlfriend came out of nowhere and asked me what happened. I explained and she called the dog back. The dog refused to come close to her, turned around at me and said ""I got you"". 
That's pretty much it.

690,Weird And Creepy Lucid Dream/False Awakening Thing Happened Last Night,Dreams,"So last night something extremely weird and kind of creepy happened. I woke up at around six thirty needing to go to the bathroom. So I went. I got extremely cold going there and back to my room so decided to turn off the fan. I didn't have to get up for school since it was a Saturday morning and it was still dark outside so I decided to go back to sleep.

This is where things get weird. I tossed and turned a lot and just couldn't get back to sleep, so I decided to go on youtube. I picked up my phone and saw an endless number of notifications. I started scrolling through them but they all just said random things that didn't make any sense. Not only that, but I realized whatever notification I predicted would be next always was. I tested this by thinking of the words red hot chilly pepper and soon enough that's what the next notification said.

And that made me realize that I had in fact fallen asleep and was dreaming. That got me excited so I sat up and tried to change my bedroom. But the more I tried, it felt like something was pressing on my chest, forcing me to lay back down in my bed and I don't know ... follow the script of my dream I guess? And the whole time this was happening, I remember feeling extremely exhausted and dazed, like I was on laughing gas or something similar. And there was also this feeling of dread in the air like I was being watched or something bad was about to happen. And there wasn't a single sound except for the air conditioner and the sounds I made whenever I moved.

I finally woke up for real a few minutes later but wasn't sure if I was awake or still in the dream. So I checked my phone and there wasn't a single notification there at all. What do y'all make of this?

691,This has been on my mind for a while...does anyone else remember specific dreams they had as a child? Dreams that occurred over & over or ones that affected you so much that you still remember?,Dreams,"I read all these posts in paranormal or glitch in the matrix about these dreams people have had. Someone said they remembered a dream from being 7 months old. I remember thinking yeah right. But yet, I remember so many dreams from my childhood/growing up. How do you even know what was a dream or what was real? How do you know if it was a dream and not a distant memory? 


For example: I distinctly remember being outside as a kid...maybe around 6-7 years old. I remember playing on our swing set. It was a hot summer day in Indiana and I was getting ready to climb up to the little landing when all the sudden 2-3 huge dogs (I always specifically thought coyotes) came up aggressively. I remember running as fast as I could to the side door on our house, bawling my eyes out & screaming. Now, a couple months ago I finally brought it up to my mom who told me that had to be a dream. Coyotes don’t do that. Only I’ve watched many videos where they do. I just don’t know how to figure out what’s real and what isn’t. Makes me feel a tad crazy sometimes lol 


Another dream that I used to have as a kid a lot was one that messed with me. My husband is the only one I’ve told this to. This is super strange. Lol. I don’t remember much of the dream, but I remember being suffocated by a boob. No joke. Like I was breastfeeding as a baby and ended up smothered. I was breastfed shortly as a baby, but I wouldn’t think it would’ve been long enough to have a memory like this? My mom got really sick shortly after having me, then I did too. I had scarlet fever and she had mastitis. I would wake up from that dream panicking and out of breath. I was always embarrassed for having it too. But I had it SO many times as a child. And now I have this major fear of being suffocated/held down. If I get pinned to the ground, I freak out.  


These obviously aren’t life changing questions I’m asking here. I’m just trying to understand. I randomly have my childhood dreams pop up in my head so just curious why. And even why I remember them. I don’t have the best memory so of all things to remember, why these things?? 


I also remember always having to protect our house in my dreams. There was like a war of the worlds going on in our backyard and I remember having a string (like a kite) and being pulled up in the sky, but fighting like hell to get back down to the ground. Stuff like that or random people trying to get in and kill us and we’d have to blockade our home. My brother has off the wall dreams too. I’m not sure if my sister ever did while she was alive. But my brother dreams of zombie apocalypses and stuff like that.

693,Lucid dreaming on Mandy,Dreams,"Snorted half a gram of MDMA by myself before bed. Couldn’t sleep all night.
At 4:30am I really wanted to sleep so I tried. Closest I could achieve to sleep was this weird hallucinatory lucid dreaming.

I dreamt that I was sat in maths class and I was only allowed to go to sleep in the bed at the front of the class (it looked so beautiful and comfy) if I completed a whole page of maths problems.
I did not want to do that.
So I stood up, walked over to my teacher and absolutely walloped her in the face. I could actually feel the connection of her cheek on my fist in real life. But as soon as I got into the comfy bed at the front, the dream reset and I was back in my seat.
So I stood up and punched her, much harder this time. But again, I was back! 😭 I tried this many many times but it failed every time.
So I gave up trying to sleep and got back to pingin.

I had a maths lesson that morning and I felt really guilty...

694,I drank the wrong koolaid,Dreams,"So another two parter. And boy is this a doozy. So the first part of the dream starts rather normally. Im an art major and living in a dorm. I meet some guy who saves my life and the world goes to hell.

Its me and him in a relatively safe apartment. Adequite food, running water, and immunity to whats out there. On occassion someone tries to seek sanctuary with us, but he refuses to let anyone in. 

The latest was a father and daughter. They banged heavily on the door.  ""Please."" The father yelled. ""If not me then my daughter please take her in.""

He's not having it despite my insistence. ""It could be a trap."" He growls. ""Let's see.""

He steps out and confronts the father and his 5year old daughter. He paces around them wiestioning both.

I hear the father mutter ""They're listening"" and see the earbud in his ear. I snatch it and toss it as a car pulls up with three other people.

""Failed to mention the car buddy. Seems you guys are good on your own. Let me guess there are more waiting? Get out of here."" The guys picks up his daughter and they leave. We head back in and bunker down.

We had been there a while, i was getting lonely and he insisted only he could be trusted. I tristed him to a point but... Another knock on the door.

I peered through the peephole and saw raven hair and the familiar slant of eyes.

""Sho."" I cried out opening the door. She was a gorgeous asian female from the film department. She specialized in dogital effects and movies.

The male wasn't having it though. ""We dont know if its really her."" He said.

""Babe, help me with something."" She said as sge befan prepping a work station. As she sat down at the digital station she gan weaving filmscenes together into a diamond tapestry the same 3scenes. A woman in a pink flowing robe slowly turn towards the camera. A woman in a blue robe talking with a man. And a woman in a blue robe descendimg stairs on a horse. When she finished she played the woven film. Sounds accompanied each real and somehow blended into a soft melody that played over and over.

Regardless though Sho earned his trust and we went out of the apartment to the music department. There were more people there.

A class was in session on the difference between classical and other pseudo-classical musics. He played one with harps and strings, that to me sounded like a traditional classical song but explained due to the addition of certain instruments was less than 50years old, and as such not classical but charlayne. He played another he described as serrated due to the sharp beat of the violas. 

We listened to the lesson for a few hours and then broke for lunch. As i walked up the stairs i dropped something i turned to grab it but he slresdy had it in hand and he grabbed my arm roughly to demamd what I was doing. I started to answer but a knife was plunged into my stomach. I woke up then.

695,Recurring dream that my balls are being crushed,Dreams,"I’ve very recently noticed that I’ve been having the same recurring dream for years now, in which my balls are being squeezed painfully, sometimes to a point where I think they’ll just pop. The dream has no narrative structure, except maybe the very visceral feeling that a hand is clamped around my balls; one dream in particular featured a dog biting my balls for what felt like a very long dream.

696,Dream where I helped my brother develop a video game,Dreams,"This dream started with me at home. I walk by my brother's room, where I hear him groaning. I peek in and see him slumped in his chair with a defeated expression.

""Dude, what's wrong?"" I asked.

""I entered a game jam... There's only a little bit of time left... My game is nowhere near finished..."" He mumbled.

&#x200B;

I take a look at his computer screen. On it was an unfinished co-op adventure game with sub-par graphics. It had a few areas implemented, but with no goal. And while there was health bars, there was no enemies.

""I better get back to work..."" He muttered.

&#x200B;

The doorbell then rang. I left my brother to his work and went to the door. I opened it to see the mailman, who handed me an envelope and left. The envelope was adressed to my brother.

""Hey, dude, there's a letter for you"" I exclaimed.

My brother walks over and takes the envelope from me. He opens it, and read it with a worried expression.

""There's only 6 months left?! I'll never get it done by then!"" He cried. He then walks over to his bed and lays down in defeat.

&#x200B;

""Uhh, want me to help make the game less, horrible?"" I offered.

""Go ahead."" He answered.

I sat down at his desk and looked at the code he had already done. While it was fine, his vision for the game could simply not be done in 6 months. So I took it upon myself to change the genre. It would be easy, considering how little my brother have done, it could've really been anything. Inspired by River City Girls, I began reworking the game into a beat 'em up.

In the dream our grandmother had died, and we inherited some of her furniture. As my parents were setting it all up they went to do something else (probably just taking a break), and then my sister walked in and said something along the lines of “this isn’t right” (btw, the room was flooded with water) and she started to tear the furniture down. I just sat and watched her cuz even dream me knows a 13 year old doesn’t have a lot of power to stop this. I don’t remember what followed afterwards, but I do remember that something led to her threatening to kill herself. And she wouldn’t stop saying it. I kept trying to talk her out of it but she didn’t listen, I even said something quite selfish along the lines of “if you can’t stop for yourself, then stop for me” and I wish I was having a lucid dream so I could control what I would say. She persisted and I tried (and failed) to think about the things that made her happy to talk her out of it. I woke up before anything else happened, and now I just feel sad.

700,The only dream I've ever had where I woke up screaming.,Dreams,"I had this dream like twenty years ago but it sticks with me.

In the dream I was a scientist and it was in first person perspective so I was seeing through my own eyes. Part of a small team of scientists. We were working on an experiment that would transport an object from one location to the other. We had built a laser type device that when it hit an object it would grab it, atom by atom, and transfers each atom to our designated location which was only a few feet away. 

The object we chose was a sewing needle.

In the dream this was the first time we were ready to fire the beam and try the experiment. Before we began there was one scientist in the group, an old man, who took his last opportunity to talk us out of it.

He said something to the effect of, ""Before we do this I want to say one more time that there is a small chance that we might destroy the universe.""

In this dream, he explained that when we grab an atom it's in a state of suspension for just a millionth of a second, and that small fraction of a second equates to us technically taking an object that exists in the past (again, just a millionth of a second in the past) and cramming it into a time and space where it didn't exist. He said that if we thought of matter in the universe as an arch, removing or adding from it, even something as small as an atom, could cause the arch to fall and the universe to collapse.

I should note here, I'm not a scientist in real life. I don't science at all.

Anyway, we decided to go ahead with the experiment.
We fired the beam and watched as the tip of the needle started to disappear and on the other table it began to assemble. Almost immediately the universe began to fall apart. The first thing that was apparent is that reality seemed placid and two dimensional. Imagine your looking down at your phone and there is no difference in depth from where your phone is to anything behind it. That your thumbs, although they are closer to your face and move normally, your vision is flat and 2 dimensional, so there is no difference in the distance in anything you see even though you know somethings are further or closer then others. Instead of depth, my vision was now like a flat painting that moved. 
Everything in the lab started doing this, the scientists were screaming and then, it started to drip. Reality couldn't hold itself up anymore and started falling like melted plastic in an oven. The woman infront of me was screaming as this depth less world started melting away and I watched in horror as the walls and machines in the room slowly dripped into each other as the world was melting down. Then the woman in front of me began to melt with it, her face blobbed into a long drip melting in with the falling room, and the sound of her scream turned into a distorted pitch that was slowing down as all the other sounds in the room seemed like they were playing their last dying note.

And then I felt it. I felt my self start to melt with everything else. I felt myself dripping in with everything else and my mind begin to freeze like everything else. My thoughts were stopping and I was beginning to melt into oblivion. I started to scream and I woke up screaming. Not a over and over again scream, just a long scream that pulled me out of that nightmare.

701,Woke up from a very surreal nightmare today,Dreams,"I was a security camera with a grainy filter in the corner of a large basement, and there were several unconscious men on the floor. From my point of view, they were faced directly at me, so the view would be as if you were on an upper floor looking down at them through a glass floor. The men kept laying there for a while, sometimes making minor groggy movements. Suddenly, a group of of men each with a chainsaw in one hand and a huge fish tail in the other entered the room from the opposite corner. They proceed to cut off the laying men's legs, waking them up. They were too weak to defend themselves, however. After their legs are off, they attach the fish tails to their torsos to make them a sort of morbid mermaid.

710,The Spanking Crone,Dreams,"My boyfriend was telling me about recurring nightmares he had as a kid. It was about a demon-like woman he called “The Crone” who would turn him over and spank him repeatedly.  He said she had pigtails and was very creepy. She has made an appearance in his dreams several times and over time she began to morph into a scary lion. But then, as he got older, he was really sick of the Crone, so he beat the shit out of her and she never appeared again. 

Last night we were watching a new movie on Hulu called Uncanny Annie. He said the little girl looked exactly like the Crone from his dream.  He started questioning whether or not some people have also seen this woman before or if she’s even real. The little girls mannerisms in the film were just like the Crone’s. 

Also let me just add, he was bullied as a kid and he got licks (spanks) from his teachers before that shit was considered a no no in school. Not sure if that fear had anything to do with the dream.  

So my question....has anyone ever experienced a dream like this or has seen a woman like this?

711,Haunted house and correctional facility wrapped into one,Dreams,"Hey all. I am new to this subreddit, but not new to my fascination with dreams and their meanings. I would like to share my dream I had last night. 

It started out in the Walmart parking lot. Me, plus 4 other people went to a haunted house (I am very fascinated with the afterlife and supernatural things). We went to this house that was abandoned in the woods somewhere. It was a very unsafe home as it was decaying rapidly. The group leader (who I would describe as an emo/gothic guy), decides that we are going to summon the ghosts and demons that reside in this house. Reluctantly, we oblige. We all sit down on the floor against a wall. He summons the spirits. Unfortunately, I don't remember what happened in that portion of the dream, other than we made it out alive. 

Then, as many dreams do, it transitioned into a mental facility (correctional, but more like Litchfield camp than Litchfield max OITNB) While we are inhabiting the correctional facility, it is bombed or blows up. At this point it's me plus 30 other men and women in this facility. We are told that we will be moved to another facility in Tennessee (where I am from and live currently.) We are picked up on a charter bus driven by this little Hispanic woman (she is more like a midget.) The bus ride seems normal until we get about 20 miles from the TN border. The bus driver turns around and heads back to the old facility ( it felt like it was upstate somewhere.) She tells us that she has orders to bring us back immediately. We do this a total of 3 times. We never make it to TN due to here turning around so many times.  We all come to the consensus that something is not right. It feels like we are being imprisoned on this bus or that she wants to kidnap us. The last trip back upstate, we actually get off the bus at a station. The driver then disappears and we try to hunt her down. We locate her multiple times, but she slips away so easy when we have her in our sights. She seems subhuman, almost like a creature from the X-Files (season 1 ep 3 ""Squeeze"".) I woke up after that.

It’s a dream I’ve been having for years now, but it’s not very frequent (every few months maybe) and it’s not the exact same dream but quite similar.

I Forgot I could do that, how could I have forgotten”, then I start going at it, but it is not really flying it is kind of flimsy or like some irregular kind of hovering. It’s like the gravity is not as strong but I still have to make effort to stay in the air, but I get better at it after a while.

What I really “like” about this dream is the way in which I fly but especially the way in which I “remember” that I can fly, it’s somewhat like when you realize you were only dreaming when you wake up but it’s during the dream.",0,could forget know dream flight quite common felt like sharing dream year frequent every month maybe exact dream quite similar walking street alley something similar suddenly remember fly always think oh sh forgot could could forgotten start going really flying kind flimsy like irregular kind hovering like gravity strong still make effort stay air get better really like dream way fly especially way remember fly somewhat like realize dreaming wake dream

716,I need an explanation,Dreams,"I originally told my girlfriend this story and decided to share it on Reddit to kind of get an explanation...


I don't know where I start out, but I enter a mansion and talk to an old guy who has his son and his wife with him. I end up touring the mansion with them. We walk up the stairs and I'm just barely in front of the wife and the child is in front of me. I'm with a friend, but I'm unsure of who it is. This time unlike most times, I know what's going to happen as if it's a video game. After about 10 or so minutes, the wife falls over and passed out cause she wasn't very fit. In this time, the old man grabs two pans and kneels down next to his wife and bangs them together while saying a prayer, in hope that his wife won't die. He then tells us that we must save her and that were her only hope. We walk down the long corridor walkway which was kind of like a bridge over the entire first floor. After a little while, I notice a glove looking thing that was kind of like the infinity gauntlet. I told it to come up to the balcony and so it did. It kind of ""digested my hand"" to become one with it. I said ""I hope this thing will come off afterwards."" We then continued down the hallway. We then went to the ""next scene"" and I was at a certain area that was like my school, but wasn't. It was a corner intersection between two buildings. With my new glove, I decided to climb up the building with it. At each window, my hands felt sweatier. And the only thing that kept me alive was the glove. As I neared the top of what seemed like a 5-6 story building, there were signs up there that said ""lol."" Once I was up there, my other friend was also up there And I didn't question how he got up there (until now). Anyway, as people noticed us at the top of the building, some tried to climb up. I don't remember anyone falling, but I do remember that there was this kind of autistic kid that goes to out school, John. We told him not to come up, but he did anyway. There were styrofoam blocks shaped like trees on top of the roof and they were blown over on top of me. The glove helped me out and pulled me out from underneath it. We threw the blocks off the roof, but it was still crowded with mats and other things like that. We looked for an exit at the top of the roof, but there was none in clear view, however, what we did find was a secret storage. There were two things inside of the storage. They were red and blue. but I had already guessed that. I had guessed that there were 3 of them... Blue white and red, however, I guessed again that it was blue and red. I was right of course. We then searched for a new way off the roof. We grabbed my glove and fashioned him in a certain way to bring up down the building as if it were a grappling hook. We took the things that were on top of the roof and got off of it. I then realized that the windows had steps on them so if you did get stuck on the roof that you could get off. We started heading down, but as we went down level by level, we got closer to one floor that had it's windows as wooden crates as if they were on shelves. I took a peak in and there was a rabbit staring in the opposite direction. In short, I threw the crate at him and he ran right out the window and out to the floor. I retreated back up to the top floor/the roof(which was actually the 9th floor, I remember myself counting the floors at this point). The rabbit, however, could jump at extreme heights. He jumped all the way from the ground to the 8th floor in a single leap.

721,My dream may have bled into real life,Dreams,"I was either three or four years old when this happened, but I remember it quite vividly. 

It was really late, probably two in the morning. I was laying down on my left side, staring at the wall, which was about a few feet away from my bed. I had my night light on, which illuminated this faint yellow glow throughout the whole room, because no way was I sleeping in the dark at that age.

At this point, I'm pretty sure I was dreaming, because all the sudden my older brother is standing next to my bed, looking at me. He doesn't say anything. I don't say anything. After a moment, he starts walking away, and eventually he just faded away, right before my eyes. It was like someone turned the transparency up and he disappeared right then and there.

So, immediately I'm like ""what the fuck was that?"" You know how three year olds usually talk. I get up out of bed and walk across the hall to my brother's room and there I find him fast asleep in his bed. And just to be sure it was actually him, I decided to pull at his eyelids (I guess in an attempt to wake him; I don't know why I did that lol). He wakes up all grumbly asking what am I doing in his room. I'm convinced he's real, then I go back to my room and fall back asleep.

Years later, I bring this up with my brother and he still remembers me walking into his room and pulling at his eyelids.

So, I guess I wasn't dreaming? But technically I was, since I did see my brother in my room, even though it wasn't actually him. Still weirds me out to this day.",0,dream may bled real life either three four year old happened remember quite vividly really late probably two morning laying left side staring wall foot away bed night light illuminated faint yellow glow throughout whole room way sleeping dark age point pretty sure dreaming sudden older brother standing next bed looking say anything say anything moment start walking away eventually faded away right eye like someone turned transparency disappeared right immediately like fuck know three year old usually talk get bed walk across hall brother room find fast asleep bed sure actually decided pull eyelid guess attempt wake know lol wake grumbly asking room convinced real go back room fall back asleep year later bring brother still remembers walking room pulling eyelid guess dreaming technically since see brother room even though actually still weird day
722,"The undertale corruption infestation (Weirdest, haunted dream halloween special, interpretation please!)",Dreams,"This is a pretty long and weird dream I had just this morning, I thought It would be awesome to share it here, because it would be an very interesting material for interpretation. I infortunately don't remember that alot of details, since the dream was very vague in It's nature.

**Before beginning with the dream,** I'm gonna share my daily life details. I'm 20 years old, male, I still live with my Father but I'm about to pass to hostel soon. I still attend school, a special education one which takes kids up to 21 of age. I was diagnosed with ADHD back when I was a small kid attending a elementary school, but later on I was ""Cured"" from it. Today however, I was diagnosed with; Oppositinal Defiant disorder (2015, 10/12), Socialised Conduct Disorder (2016, 4/2), Conduct Disorders (2015, 10/12), OCD (2016, 11/2), and later on OTHER NONORGANIC PSYCHOTIC DISORDERS and  UNSPECIFIED NONORGANIC PSYCHOSIS.

Last years starting from high school, I became short tempered and was quickly to anger, turning into destructive behavour and acting on my impulses up even to this day. My sleep schedule is also kinda bad, and I have those worry thoughts that I will not be able to sleep. Later on those days, I'm experiensing some conflicts with my Father, usualy fron the steem that he is ""Dissapointed"" in me that I didn't follow up his expectations, he wont get off me about that I should start living alone and telling me to get a job (Being very pushy about it).

I do care about my ""Self-image"", I'm trying to exercize, sometimes struggling with my laziness, as those last 3 years I gained lots of weight and a quite amount of fat, I even had to throw away some clothes because they didn't fit me. I do care about my clothing choice and always trying to fit it on my style. Unfortunately, when I wen't with my Father to buy shoes and clothes, my Father responded with ""Ha! See? Told you I was right."" when the seller said to him ""Well, actualy, your son is more full than you"" something like that. That wasn't pleasant for me, cause I know that my Father ingludge the same food as me and he very rarely does exercize compared to me.

&#x200B;

**Anyway, here is my dream;**

`Seemingly, the dream started with my Father getting a better PC than me. Later on, he even got a Better phone than me and started to boast about it, said ""See? Now I have better phone than yours!"". The phone that my Father got in the dream seems like an old telephone with bottoms, yet I preceived that his phone is better than mine, but still I asked ""Does your phone has buttons?"", my Father responded Negatively to that, I don't remember how the conversation went on.`

`Later on, something happened that the Monitor of my PC was unable to hold properly, as It's ""Leg"" got absolutely broken and unable to stand properly, so then I got dissapointed, as my Monitor rendered unuseable because of that.`

`Then, I see that my Father has started to play Undertale (Yes, that game), he seems to enjoy it, even though in my waking life, my Father never played undertale and he doesn't like those games. When looking at his Game screen, I've noticed 3 characters there standing facing the screen; Flowey, Chara and Asgore.`

`The game got glitched to hell though, and my Father for some reason put the blame on me, and told me I should fix it, or something like that.`

`I've decided to see what happened to his game (Undertale), and this is where the Dream wen't weird, creepy and completely f*cked up.`

`So what happened to the game exactly? Well, the game seemed to be completely glitched, just purple colored ""Glitch"" effects everywhere. To describe how I interpreted it as, some haunting ""Evil"" entity, which was female, has cursed the game during It's ""Initiation"" proccess.`

`This is the part of the dream where it wen't vague. I just remember that I was struggling to somehow eliminate this entity, to make the game Undertale to launch properly.`

`The ""Evil"" entity was just so extended out it started to corrupt the world outside of the Undertale game. Purple colored ""Glitch"" effects everywhere.`

`I remember that there are 3 ""Evil"" characters that was plaguing the Dream world:`

`> The main ""Evil"" entity. For some reason, she was a Female, she seemed to have purple hair, and she seemed to be very determined in keeping plaguing the Dream world, she quite resembled Maleficient in rest of her appearance.`

`> The second character, seemed to be a man, a shadowy figure but all purple, he seemed to be wearing a Fedora hat and a Trench coat.`

`> Third character, was for some reason, was Shrek. So random. And yeah, he was also an ""Evil"" entity, just like the 2 above. He didn't have anything ""Extraordinary"" expect his face was creepy for some reason, he had a little of blood coming out of his eyes.`

`The dream wen't on with me numerious times trying to contain all this ""Evil"" plague.`

`It is the last scene of the dream, where I reached my Father's PC, booted up the game Undertale. The scenario started with Sans the skeleton first looking at me, but then he started walking on to the Right side of the game screen, I was at this part hoping that booting up the game again would make Undertale starting normaly and eliminating this weird cursed plague.`

`Second later I've heard voice saying ""Don't look, or death will come."", purple glitch effects starting to appear as Sans was walking in the Game screen to the Right side, meanwhile the 3 ""Evil"" entities are standing looking at Sans. I covered my eyes, as the voice said. I was in hope that Sans reaching the Right side of the Game screen will eliminate this cursed plague from the game and the Dream world. But to my surprise, while I was trying to not look and cover my eyes with my hands I still able to see the game screen with Sans trying to reach the other side.`

`This is where it started to get intense, rest of the game was blacking out expect for Sans face, as Sans was reaching the Right side of the screen, this is where the feeling of creepiness and dread started to intensify. I covered my eyes as hard as I could but I was still able to see the screen a little, it is then at the end when Sans reached the Right side of the screen just standing there and facing my direction, suddently Shrek's face appeared, though I'm not sure it was really visible, It's like It's there and not there at the same time, but I just remember It's details perfectly for some reason, already described above. At this moment the creepiness and dreadfulness got very intense, which resulted in my waking up with a gasp.`

Strange thing about this dream is; I'm not sure why it used the Purple color as the representation of the evil entities. I'n real life, purple (Especialy violet) is my favorite color, green is next after it. Especialy that purple for me symbolises being powerful and overall I just find this color the most beautiful, inspired from all those anime's where powerful characters have their super/magical powers purple colored, unless there is something more to this color that I'm missing. And about glitch effects, same as purple color, It's very cool effect and I use it quite alot when I make my animations (Which is a thing for another thread).

We're on the sixth floor and my balcony isn't attached to a roof. But in my dream it's almost the same layout but the couch is gone and my balcony is attached to another building's roof.

I was sitting on my bed and in the room with me, on my balcony and the roof attached to it, there are men. My little sister is with me and we start bickering and kinda fighting. One of the men comes up to us and screams in our faces to shut up, we do but soon after bicker again. He come back and screams again. At this point, I am terrified of these men (I'm wearing a long shirt and really short shorts) and I'm terrified for my sister. I get up from my bed slowly and quietly (afraid he might come back and scream at me) and go to my parent's room which is to the left when you leave my room. I had left my sister so I was moving quickly, afraid of the men doing something to her.

My mom is laying on the bed and I get go to her and sit next to her and tell her about these guys. She says nothing and just smiles. Suddenly, the same guy from before comes in my mom's room and sits in front of me, he says something but at this point I can't remember. He puts his hand on my thigh and then inner thigh kinda going up, I'm basically paralyzed and I look at my mom, she's just smiling doing nothing. Then I wake up sweaty and terrified.

I finally had enough and decided to make it so that I could never work there again. I started off small and made a mess of the work area. I let crumbs of food drop into computers and consoles. My partner cleaned it and kept working. I went a more extreme route and started dropping water on them. He freaked out and quickly dried it off. I took it one step more and started deleting files and closing important programs, to which my partner reset my computer to a backup that's periodically made throughout the day.

733,Another one of my weird media-themed dreams.,Dreams,"Yesterday I dreamed of a carnotaurus-looking dinosaur (it basically was like a reddish T-Rex with horns) attacking Spongebob's house, and Ash, Misty and Brock from Pokémon try to defeat it. Since I woke up just a few hours ago I have a good amount of memories of it to describe it in detail.

The dinosaur was around twice as tall as Spongebob's house while the others were around the size of the usual character of the show, meaning that by comparison the carnotaurus-thingy was absolutely massive. To defat it they first shoot it with water using a water Pokémon to get it wet (even if they already are underwater?) and then the trainers line up alongside some of their Pokémon to ""carry electrical power to Pikachu"" or something.
A shock comes from Ash at the bottom of the line (like, no Pokémon or weapon, he's the one that casts the shock all by himself) and moves to the other trainers and Pokémon, it ultimately reaches Pikachu that uses it to shock the dinosaur to death with a mid-air shock (like the Thunderbolt he uses in the Anime) after a high jump.

The dinosaur drops dead on the floor next to Spongebob's house, which remained intact, Pikachu then lands on the ground and smiles, and I wake up.

Also the only Pokémon I remember were Pikachu and a Mankey (being one of the ""links"" used in Ash's electrical attack), I don't remember any of the other ones, including the water one that ""wet"" the dinosaur.

What's wrong with my dreams always being weird like this? Like, I do have occasions where I remember my dreams and most of them are all crossovers of stuff I like or weird versions of them. I have a ton of similar media-themed dreams, as in ""cartoons/videogames"" etc., but I guess that's to be expected since I barely have any friends and don't go outside often, so stuff that I look at on screens is what my brain has to work with when I sleep, I think...",0,another one weird medium themed dream yesterday dreamed carnotaurus looking dinosaur basically like reddish rex horn attacking spongebob house ash misty brock pokémon try defeat since woke hour ago good amount memory describe detail dinosaur around twice tall spongebob house others around size usual character show meaning comparison carnotaurus thingy absolutely massive defat first shoot water using water pokémon get wet even already underwater trainer line alongside pokémon carry electrical power pikachu something shock come ash bottom line like pokémon weapon one cast shock move trainer pokémon ultimately reach pikachu us shock dinosaur death mid air shock like thunderbolt us anime high jump dinosaur drop dead floor next spongebob house remained intact pikachu land ground smile wake also pokémon remember pikachu mankey one link used ash electrical attack remember one including water one wet dinosaur wrong dream always weird like like occasion remember dream crossover stuff like weird version ton similar medium themed dream cartoon videogames etc guess expected since barely friend go outside often stuff look screen brain work sleep think

My presence instantly made them turn their heads and smile at me oddly - note that they were ready to tickle me because it is most likely for me that when I have a dream with a spongebob-theme to it, I will be followed or literally be given a test by the characters and once they got me or I fail the test they will tickle me - a very annoying experience.",0,childhood dream gary playing video game dream long time ago single digit age remember much remember walked video game shop tropical theme either normal game store orange wall anyway walking store greeted spongebob watching pet gary small mechanical plane controlled plane flying jellyfish field shown video game projector screen presence instantly made turn head smile oddly note ready tickle likely dream spongebob theme followed literally given test character got fail test tickle annoying experience
739,Bit by owl in dream meaning?,Dreams,"Had a dream that my SO and I were in bed and there was two cats stampeding around the room. My SO was asleep but I was watching the cats try to catch a small flying animal. Thought it was a bat or small bird but it suddenly flew towards me and I pulled up the sheet to cover myself. It kept diving towards me and I woke my SO up. When I asked him what it was he said, very nonchalant, “it’s one of those small owls” and went back to sleep. The owl continuously did a lap around the room and would land near my face. Every time I’d pull the sheet up and he’d bite my fingers through the sheet, I’d shoo him away and he’d do the same lap. Over and over. I woke up to actually feeling pain on my finger like I’d really been bit. Can not get over it for some reason. So strange.

740,"A weird, creepy dream I just had that may have no meaning but I have to talk about it somewhere since Im not sleeping anytime soon",Dreams,"So, I feel like its important to state that I havent been able to remember dreams at all up to this one, and even this one I remember bits and pieces of. I dont know if there is some hidden meaning in it, but it shook me way more than I am used to being shaken by stuff like this. Please just dont tell me Im crazy or anything, thats the last thing I need to hear right now.

My dream 
Some kind of futiristic pastures and im running around and over mysteriously big fallen trees and seeing disturbing creatures. 
I, i guess i teleport home, or rather ""home"" whatever it was and suddenly im in the middle of trying to find an empty space to sleep with a very good looking girl, i dont know where that came from. Fastforward a little and im in the middle of a field thats supossed to be the little field in front of my appartment building but its a whole lot bigger and the girl is there qith me, the one i was suppssed to dream of having sex with. She and i are talking, when all of a sudden, since theres some kind of event? , that my sick mind came up with, come out of nowhere these disturbing looking priests? monks?  I dont know, but they were disturbing in every sense of the word, like, not scary, well, a bit scary, but not like nightmare fuel by them selves, the way they moved and looked at us and everything else made the scene so much more scary than it should have been. Me and the girl walk forward. She is scared of them apparently, and sobbingly squezes my hand, while im calm and colected, they only disturbed me right before i woke up from the dream and then later more. The last scene i remember is of me and the girl, who, id like to state, that i dont even know, of all things i cant remember her face and thats bugging me, so me and the girl walk up to some of the
creepy disturbing pilgrims/monks/priests and i look one in the eye and she starts jumping around and hittimg me lightly on the shoulder. She looks like your typical creepy ""oracle/fortune teller"" with eyes that are red at the sides of the eyeballs and a few bad and yellow teeth. There were more of them and they blocked our path, but i only remember one more face, the last one i saw. He wasnt creepy looking, but given the circumstances, he was creepy to me and at that moment, with the creepy fortuneteller hitting me, jumping around like a monkey and screaming jiberish i couldnt understand, i walk up to the last guy i remember and try to just pass through them, but they shove us back and i try again. At this point, the girl is terrified and squezing my hand very hard, but im still trying to act cool, even tho i was just about done using my shiting-my-pants pants. So we try to go through the crowd of pilgrims in front of us one last time and they push us back hard, start walking to us and suddenly we are surounded. At that point, i lost all ability to act cool and start panicking, but the last thing that happens is the last guy i remember comes up to us and says to me:""Now you are going to go sleep with her!"". Aaaand, thats when i wake up... Pretty crazy dream, the first one I could remember a big part of in a while. So, reddit, tell me what you think this means? I know dreams can be crazy but this was something else to me.. 

Id like to describe at least one of the pilgrims. The one i remember through fog looked like a human alien. Like one of those tall grey ones that you most often see but he was human so huge head and black eyes, veins all over his bald head and he was a tall dude, wearing some kind of purple and black robe like all of them but as far as I remember he was the only one that looked like that out of all of them, the rest looked like generic pilgrims that all wore the same robe as the tall grey alien looking dude.

741,Dream in my own POV as self and POV as an anime character (NSFW),Dreams,"I had this long dream but only for a short time. 

At first, I was myself in a big school. It was lunch time or something that I brought the school's stove, that contains rice, to this certain place because I want to eat alone. What I do not know is that the place I am is the hangout area of 3 girls. So, when I was eating, when I heard someone tried to enter, I hid somewhere in the room but eventually, they found me. 

We had a talk and agreed to keep it secret and all; we even shared the rice I brought. At night time, they said I could sleep with them, so I did. Few days later, they invited me to a trip, I don't know where but we have a hotel to stay too. Two girls left us to do something, so I was alone with this one girl. And from that moment on, we start to get attach to each other and had sex. We even had sex when we returned from the trip. Every night, when we all sleep, both of us always had sex in the bathroom quietly. It felt real to be honest. 

After we slept together is this second dream. I am an anime character; specifically I am dreaming as Ryuji from Toradora, and that my girlfriend is Taiga. We were eating at this cafe and Taiga is being really cute to me that she even suggested that we do it on the table, and so we did. Hours later, we are in this tree, looking at the beautiful scene of the city. It's like we're having an intimate at that time. And of course we had sex. Before we slept together on the tree, she told me that she wants to do it with protection next time. Then when I woke up, something happened to the world, it has become more futuristic and Taiga is gone and nowhere to be found. So I went to town to buy some protection and tried to find her anywhere but couldn't. Eventually, I went back to the tree where we always used to be and there I found her. The tree aged fast too. She hugged me like she misses me and I do the same. Then, we talked about the things happened around us. After that, I opened the protection, but the protection looks robotic, that we didn't even use it. She told me that she wants a family, and so we had sex and I ejaculate inside her; it was vivid that it felt so real, even the way she hugs me while having sex. 

After that, I woke up. Kind of felt sad that I wish to continue it.

742,I dreamed of a melody,Dreams,"I was trying to take a nap in the afternoon today, and had one of those short, fast moving dreams you get when you’re about to fall asleep. There was an indistinct autumn scene with a clarinet playing an eerie, descending melody, and strings were accompanying it by quickly switching between two notes softly. I returned to a waking state, and was able to recreate it on my keyboard before I forgot it, thankfully.

743,Grief Dreams/Processing Dreams. Dreamt of my brother again.,Dreams,"I dreamt of my deceased brother again last night. I'm sharing in hopes of gaining perspective and coping skills.

Some context: he passed 16 yrs ago in a car accident at the age of 19. I'm 15 months older than him, it's fair to say we were close in age and that we had many of the same interest and many of the same friends.

Last night's dream wasn't too bad, I pulled it together pretty quick afterwords.

Sometimes when I dream and he's in it I wake convinced it was real, that he's alive. Then the whole world crashes in on me and I can't breath. The loss consumes me all over again. This is common around his birthday or the anniversary of the accident, or sometimes around big holidays like the 4th or Christmas. I suppose there's a nostalgia I get lost in around these times of the year. I actually enjoy the dreams, just not the tail spin I go threw when reality hits. 

It's not near any important or annual date right now. So last night was unexpected.

In last night's dream I was a teen again and my violent father had hurt someone horribly and they were missing. I was grilling my brother for details and he didn't want to give them up, didn't want to anger our father further. It felt so real. I woke missing him so much. The bitter sweet part was seeing his face and hearing his voice.

In one of the first dreams I had after his accident I was riding with him in his car, just driving around. Every time we came near where the accident happened he'd turn off onto another road. We never went by that spot. He was so upset. He asked me why everyone was ignoring him? Why no one answered the phone when he called? Why people where acting like they couldn't see him? He said even our grandma was acting that way. What had he done to deserve that? That I was the only one acting normal. I swear we drove around for hours. Finally, when we pulled up to a four way stop and the place of his accident was just up ahead out of view I told him no one was ignoring him, that we all loved him and missed him so much. I asked him why he kept turning and didn't drive forward. He said he didn't know why. I told him just ahead is where he had gotten in a horrible accident and there was nothing anyone could do and that he had passed. He was horrified, and then disappeared. Poof, gone from the car. I woke sobbing. It took me weeks to recover. And I told no one.

A few years ago I had a dream that felt so real. He found me and told me it was all fake, the accident and all of it. That he had witnessed something horrible and had to go into hiding. The accident and funeral was all faked to protect him. That it had finally all been resolved so he was free to return to his life. I couldn't believe it, but he had all this proof from the CIA & FBI, it was wild but there he was in the flesh. It was so exciting. A real miracle. I went with him to brake the news to our grandparents. It was amazing, the kind of thing that only happens on TV or in the movies. I actually woke believing it was all real for at least 5 minutes before I dropped by my bed, drowning in the reality that it was all a dream. Just deep sobs and unending tears. Again, I couldn't tell anyone, it just hurt too bad.

There has been a handful of dreams like the ones I've shared, the ones that feel as real as anything else in life. I don't know how to process those. How to find meaning in them. I'm often hopeful that there's messages in them or that they're from him. Mostly I think they're just undealt with grief.

A common thing in a lot of the dreams I've had with him is that he is silent. He will smile or nod, but will not speak. Sometimes it's so obvious that I'll even ask something like don't you have anything to say? He'll smile and shrug at that. Other times I won't realize to after I wake that he never actually spoke, that we fully conversated with me speaking and him using gestures.

I have a big fear of when the time comes that he's been gone longer than he was here. I'm not sure how I will process or work threw that. 

What can I do with these dreams? With the fall out? I feel like I have very little control or perspective, that I always tuck them away. I have a love/hate relationship with them, but would not rid myself of them if I could, I'd just process them and the fallout better. Is there a name for this?

746,Dreamt of my dead Grandfather,Dreams,"I had an extremely vivid dream of my deceased grandfather about a week ago that I just can't shake off my head. My grandfather has been dead for over 7 years. I only met him a handful of times when I was a small kid, I am now 40 years old so I'm a bit confused only because the dream seemed as real as can be. 

My dream showed me standing next to my grandfather in his small ranch house next to a coral where he kept his sheep. He was just standing there with his old weathered flat cowboy hat and his crooked little smile, one of his eyes seemed to be a bit droopy. Although it seemed that he knew I was there he never acknowledged me.

We were standing there quiet just watching his sheep when a small white dirty baby lamb snuck out of the bottom of the coral door. My grandfather was quit to grab it but then the lamb snuck back out, this time the lamb managed to get out of the gate surrounding his house and although grandpa was just standing there not saying a word I had a feeling that he wanted me to go catch it for him. I walked outside the gate and the streets were completely empty and the lamb was nowhere to be seen. 

I walked up to the corner of his house where a street ran parallel and there was no sign of the little lamb, eventually my grandfather walked out and headed towards me just gazing but still ignoring that I was there and he never looked directly at me. He made a left turn and began to walk away from me although I wanted to follow him I couldn't do it, my feet wouldn't move. Out of nowhere  people appeared and began walking in his direction, I then started to walk away in an opposite dorection of him,  I then turned around just to see him one last time and when I did I noticed that there was a small child walking next to him. Idk who the child was or where they were headed and i couldn't tell whether it was a boy or girl. 

Next thing I know a small group of people began to walk next to me including a young man who kept talking to me but I couldn't understand a word he was saying, all I know is that he looked hopeful.  Shortly after I woke up.

747,2 Dreams # 16-18 the girl dies (multiple dreams obviously),Dreams,"So in this dream I was going to this boot camp thing for some reason idk and it sorta looked the part but it wasn't that at all (more of a singing camp),

So the place had red padded walls and black rolled up mats and a isle to walk through to get to there place,

And as they were standing (omg as I'm typing this there are more dreams flooding back with more detail and my brain is hurting) I look and see this screen and it's like a movie theater screen outside so be able to sing the lyrics and the teacher comes out from the right of my view and the session starts as we are taught to sing and how to sing high notes and stuff like that, I could see the lyrics but forgot what they said.

So this is another kingdom hearts dream,

So in this dream I am meeting with a friend and when we get to his house I learn he has kingdom hearts 1 and 2 and me wanting to fight the secret bosses wanted to play so I find the games and start telling him about the secret bosses (cause apparently he didn't know they were there) and so he let's me put the games in to fight them but then I get too excited and wake up.

Now I never told this one cause it's really dark (and now I forgot some bits but I will try to remember it) but it involves the same girl from 2 Dreams #12 but in this dream something happened and the girl had died from stress (idk if I should really say exactly what happened so I'm just saying that) and I'm thinking about all the times we've had  together and I'm sitting next to this baby carrier and said,

""Well son it looks like it's just me and you, and I'll be kind to you like I was kind to her""

Then I woke up and was then depressed.

So in this dream and it's the same girl from 2 dreams # 12 but we were in this tower and she was in this dress,

(So idk of anything else happened before or this is how the dreams started, though I thing I was walking in circles listening to music id remember though) so I was face to face with the girl and she had a knife and stabbed me in the heart,

So as she then yanked the knife from my heart I fell down to the ground holding the stab wound and as I saw blood coming from my heart I also saw blood coming from my eyes and then i looked at her as she was smirking at me and then I looked back to the ground,

But then i was then switched to seeing from her view and saw my self still down on all fours,

Then I looked up at her and my blood had turned pitch black and my eyes were pure black as I said,

""I have no heart""

And then rushed to her screaming in rage and her face turned from a smirk to complete horror as I then ended her, then my dream jump cut me to still walking in circles listening to music but this time me being angry.

748,I had a dream where the Rugrats children characters got molested.,Dreams,"It was the most terrifying dream I had in a longest while that made me almost vomit!

I was at work in a new mall. This mall had an under-ground section for shopping. It also contained a restaurant which I work at in real life. We were closing and the lights in the food store was still on and we were the last few to leave. Everyone left already and I stayed for a bit for some reason. There was another girl there who was staying and we both left as she texted on her cell-phone as we go up these airport stairs escalators. They were broad and wide open. As we go up, it felt as if I was in an airport or in the first floor of the shopping center. The entrance and exit was there on my left with other cashier places there. The place was massive like an airport. As I kept walking straight down the isles, the area had gotten darker, and darker and no light was shown to be. All I could remember was Chuckie being child molested by one of those character like designs from the Rugrats in a huge cloud that filled the area. This area was now blue and black that filtered each other brightly. The Rugrats had their own clones that those men looking characters made from the clouds. They were laughing and pointing fingers at the characters when they completely brought impaired and meet their clones that were soggy and droopy like looking. They weren't moving and just sitting as the other originals ran while they got raped by the clones. (To me, this part was more disgusting as I over-looked at it.).

749,Dream Number Four 09-Jan-19 (I've had so may more) this one was a really weird combination of things haha,Dreams,"I was playing the game of god. We had to recreate Earth, but it had to look the exact same way. I had just about finished and got one of my supervisors to look over my work. She pointed out that part of china was still blank and there was an extra continent swirling around Australia (like the hand from Coraline closing in around the continent)*.* I couldn’t be bothered to fix this so I just piled huge wheat seeds on top of the blank space in China, then got distracted thinking I should create some humans so I'd have someone to live through....*such a stupid idea*.

Then I was playing the game with my cousin and a young child who reminded me of Matilda. At first it was just the two of us playing in my kitchen but then I explained the rules to the child and created a starting tool for her out of some play-doe. I told the child that this was only temporary, and I’d have to take them back home soon. 

After a while this mean, creepy, old man came and tried to take the child away. He tried to take the child into his house which we were suddenly in front of; it was in a desert there was sand everywhere and a pale wooden door (similar to the sand village in Naruto). I wouldn't let him take her, so he tried to kill me using his shadow. But he missed, so I used my shadow to kill him while holding the child’s hands. (It was shown from behind us with our hands in center screen and my shadow stretched to cover the man and drag him through the ground screaming into hell). The child was in shock and awe at what I had done; she suddenly declared “I’m attached!” claiming me as her guardian. I was too. Then she explained that we would need to get out of there because the whole place and everyone in it was corrupt and the old man had many political ties, (it kinda reminded me of the episode of archer where they’re at the Mexican/American boarder).

How ever many times this repeats is called a ""layer"".

I wanted to open up a discussion for the best way to get out of these loops with less ""layers"" traversed and tactics to more quickly realize when you're in yet-another-dream rather than reality.

One thing that I've found helps is considering if you're in your actual house or bedroom when you wake up. I am often falsely waking up in a house or bedroom of the past or that I am otherwise familiar with, but not my own, yet do not make that logical connection quickly enough.

753,I keep having dreams where I lose my virginity and something terrible happens.,Dreams,"I am a virgin - never even kissed a guy - but for some reason I keep having dreams in which I lose my virginity in a PG13 fashion.  Afterwards, I end up pregnant, or just plain old sad because I didn't like the guy, and my (very conservative Christian/Asian/Caribbean) parents shame me for having sex and force me to drop out of college in the pregnancy ones.  In one of the dreams, my mom tried to help me hide the pregnancy.  In other ones, she's super mad that I even had sex.

I looked at the ""common dreams interpreted"" pregnancy page, but I don't know what kind of symbolism to get from these dreams.  I don't know what kind of idea that I would be gestating.

There was this group of women protesting something, but it didn't seem serious. Then we looked forward as something hit the ground faster than I have ever seen about a mile away. It looked like a missile. Then there was this explosion that ballooned out. I had time to say ""Well, we're going to die."" Then, some girl next to me screamed and we all died in the explosion.

756,Medieval surgery,Dreams,"So, this is a pretty vivid and painful dream I had though now that I awake I find it really interesting.                
So I was with twenty-ish guys all armed with curved swords for some reason, making our way up a flight of industrial stairs. Suddenly, half the people turned on us and a bloody fight ensued. In the end, only me and one enemy stood and, just as I felled him, he managed to slice my neck. We both fell down and I tried my best to stop the bleeding while the world turned black. I don't know how long I layed down, but at a certain point I had accepted the fact that I was going to die, and was just waiting for it to happen, only, at that point, I must had lost so much blood that bleeding had slowed down to a point where my hand still resting on the same position as when I had tried to stop the bleeding , was actually helping keeping me alive. I was just waiting for all of it to be over when I heard: ""This one I still alive! Bring a surgeon!""       
Being that I was, for some reason, in the Middle Ages, I wasn't exactly thrilled at the idea of a medieval surgeon trying to fix me up. I though I would still end up dead, but with added suffering. They started to fix me up, and it wasn't pleasant: I could not move nor see, but felt the blade of the knife slicing my skin to expose and suture the artery and the drill that, for some reason, was piercing my teeth. The surgeon actually saved me, but for some reason linked the thread from my neck, through my upper lip and a couple of teeth too.       
I came back home, in the modern world (dream logic) this time, only to be made fun of because of this thread hanging from my lip to my neck.      As I said it was really painful to experience, from the blade slicing my neck, to helplessly bleeding out and the dreadful wait for the surgeon to cut, but hey, he actually knew what he was doing!

758,Weird and Worrying Dream,Dreams,"Before the dream...

 I've been receiving texts from one of my friends about her mental health status. She's saying that she's fine but her texts made it seems like something's seriously wrong, she's constantly saying that she's alright but I called her just to make sure everything's alright because she's been missing from school for a week, she's okay but I'm still concerned about her because the texts have this tone of... you know what I mean

In the dream...

I am sitting on a desk with my surroundings being gray and nothing else, only gray and a few specks of white particles that's either snow or dust. A few moments later, I heard a voice, to which I turned around and saw a girl standing next to me, around my age, in a short dress and summer hat, glowing green and translucent. She walked up to me and started asking ""What's wrong?"" with me answering with my problems. We both got engaged into a conversation, with her being *really* chill and knew that she's just a spirit and I'm the only one who can see her. I started talking about problems and finally engaging in a casual conversation, walking down alleys, sitting on a bench and even float for a second. And its not like she's being controlled too, she *is* sentient and is aware of what's going on. We would be together everywhere with me being the only one that can interact with her. The only aspect I did not know about her is her face, because... she covered it with a face mask from what I remember.

Everything was fine until my surroundings started distorting, and she just said ""Times up now... its nice talking to you... see you in another dream..."" before she fades away and I wake up

762,Lots of violence. Advice?,Dreams,"This one was so clear and it’s stayed vivid after two days. I had a dream where I was in my apartment, and there were a couple friends of mine, they kept appearing one by one like out of a John Wick movie. They are all men, and all had a knife or a weapon of come sort, and each of them had an intent to hurt or kill me. And they all seemed so sadistic, because they were smiling or laughing whenever I got hurt or was in pain or when I was slammed against a wall while fighting. Even my lizard, my male bearded dragon named Oscar, was lunging at the door to his cage, hissing and snapping at me angrily. I was able to lock him in his terrarium, but the guys were so persistent that the only way for me to survive was to kill them, one after the other as they appeared. They wouldn’t listen to what I said, as if I wasn’t speaking at all, or if they couldn’t hear me. I had to use the k-bar my parents gifted me for Christmas a few years ago to protect myself. After they were all dead, I walked out of the apartment and down the stairs, came to the stair-loft, and just couldn’t walk anymore. Just cut, bloody, bruised, and alone.

Every part of the dream was so vivid and the hits and movements felt so real, that I found myself flinching when one of those friends touched my shoulder, or called out to me. I’ve even felt timid towards Oscar.

763,"It seems naps always give me the most vivid and terrifying dreams. This is an example of that, having happened just within the last 15 minutes.",Dreams,"(for purposes of this dream, “we” is myself and my boyfriend)
a man went through the hospital while we were visiting my mother, mass killing everyone.  
we knew of it first because of the elevator. 
it had a screen read that it had been stopped because of excessive blood in the shaft and elevator itself. 
while it was stopped, we ran. 
i pointed out the nearest exit and instead of waiting to find out what happened to my mom or anyone else, we ran to get out but didn’t make it.
he for whatever reason wanted to stop for some whack ass pudding shit that the hospital was giving away at this sample stand before we could get to the door. 
while we were grabbing that, a young girl ran to me from the top of the hospital stairs. 
she had short purple hair and one of those rainbow drug rugs on. 
she was my friend in the dream or something but i have no idea who she was. 
she asked me what our plan was to tell this killer when he got to us because he was questioning and killing everyone on site in this “zombie massacre” as she called it. 
we had no clue what we were gonna say. 
it was then that the hospital orderlies found us and filed us in a lobby area with the rest of everyone. 
my brother managed to meet up with us (i’m guessing he was already in the hospital when we got there) and was behind me. 
i had no idea what happened to my mom and was terrified for her. 
we were sat down in a line near the hospital window and the man came in, dressed in a tan trenchcoat, and looked at everyone. 
he walked to the front of the lobby area we were in and pulled each group of people (families that were together) forward. 
he would kill one member from each group as everyone else drank those protein ensures in a toast. 
finally.. it was us. 
he pulled my boyfriend, me, and my brother forward. 
he held a knife to my back as we all sat and my bf looked at me with that “i love you but dont say anything” look. 
he gave this whole rant before choosing one of us. 
while he did so, i began to make some sexual  comment or something about what his reasoning was for doing what he was doing because it was ridiculous and psychotic. 
he put his foot on my chest, looked to me and asked “what? are you a slave? a dirty little whore? begone slave.”
orderlies were yelling and screaming from the back and he for whatever reason looked to them
(mind you this was comical because the mass killer was a mixture of russell brand and dennis quaid). 
my bf managed to get him off of me and my bf headbutted the mask he was wearing, causing him to drop his knife, and the mask cracked into pieces all over the floor. 
the man sank down kind of vulnerable at first. 
my bf, dazed, fell to the ground with your head on my chest. 
my brother was curled up on the opposite side in fear. 

then i woke up.

764,"Dream number three. Me, She, He, We had to Escape!",Dreams,"*It’s all jumbled in my brain……*

We were in a futuristic prison, but we didn’t realise (it was like Black Mirror episode 2 but only in vibes). I was seeing the situations through so many different eyes, but they were all working towards the same goal – escape.

At one point I had to fill out a survey, it was similar to a test in class and there was a woman there overseeing what we did. It was weird questions…. 

My friend and I got off a bus down my street and began to walk to mine. A dog started following us and I wanted to bring it home, it was small and white and fluffy. There was also another dog that already had a leash on it and my friend said somebody had claimed it. Then a car came, some other guy picked us up and told me to leave the dog. He took us home. The dogs were a part of our escape plan.

When we walked in the front room it had different couches. The test results were displayed on the wall behind us next to the door, I thought that I couldn’t judge this man's test result because I was forced to make kind of kinky videos about my socks.

We were being monitored. All the time, there was someone else was watching us…. I keep thinking of portal*.* It was like that, but we were all in different rooms/locations and had to solve pieces of the puzzle without being caught. 

A different me was sitting on computer in the front room and mum was next to me. She got up to do something so I quickly looked something up on her computer to help us with the escape, it would be underway soon. We just needed to bide our time for a bit longer. I was looking up videos of the patterns on the beach, the ripples in the sand, the lines engraved into rocks. I felt like I was in the waves, part of the ocean.

767,Dream About Voodoo Dolls,Dreams,"I had a dream taking place in my house and in like a alternate universe setting. I suppose it could be considered a nightmare.

I should probably use an alt account instead of my art account, but I thought some might find this interesting.

The dream begins with me waking from my bed. I exit the curtain that surrounds the bed and look out the big window to the left of me. It’s dark outside with dim moonlight illuminating the area. I see outside glowing animal like dolls milling about. The fabric seemed to be of burlap sack in texture. They had large strings holding the body together but the creatures themselves ranged from guinea pig to cat sized. Upon seeing them I initially was confused, but then got a dreadful feeling. 

I exited my bedroom and went to the living room. Everything looked as it should. The air felt chilled as it does in winter. The living room has a whole wall of windows leading to a deck area and the entire lawn visible. I saw more of these multi colored voodoo animals moving around outside. Some in trees and some in the grass. Monkey, dog, lizard, and all sorts of animal shaped burlap creatures out in the dark. It seemed almost ritualistic.

I calmed assuming since I was in the house and they were outside I was safe. I turned to go tell the rest of the family when I saw a small lime green glowing stegosaur looking voodoo creature beside the backside of the couch. It swayed its head like a living creature does when looking around. I screamed for my mom and she came downstairs. “You are those things too?”, she asked. I was about to point out the small stegosaurus voodoo creature when I woke up.

769,A wild dream I had awhile back,Dreams,"Hi guys, I really enjoy keeping a dream journal and thought I’d share a crazy dream I wrote down.

There was a group of bad people.  Some of them were chasing little kids down a path with cars.  A dove with a blazing ring of fire swooped down in front of the pursuers and grew so much brighter.  This caused them to burn to a crisp.  The kids were saved and the burnt bodies remained, but not long after, exact copies of the killed assailants appeared to replace the dead ones.  As this was happening I ran back in the direction they chased the kids from.

There was a small property with a cabin.  I went into the cabin and there was a door with a hallway on the other side.  In the hallway you could either go to a door on the left which was a bathroom, or keep going to the end and turn the corner to a broader area where there was a house.  I ran past the bathroom, around the corner, and into the house, locking the door behind me.  My pursuers didn't find me but I felt threatened and intimidated because they were looking for me.  I found a cage in the house that had a couple geckos and a rat in it.  

For some reason I thought these were my pets, and I felt like I forgot about them for a year.  I tried to remember their names but couldn't.  The rat severely attacked one of the geckos, but I didn't try to stop it because I was scared of the rat shredding my hand.  I was angry at it and managed to grab it by the tail without it attacking me.  In contempt, I flung it across the room as hard as I could.  The gecko wasn't dead but it was pretty badly injured.  It had cuts all over and some of its top lip was missing.  

I removed it from the cage and desperately tried to find items to heal it. I kept getting delayed from finding anything, such as needing my teeth fixed by a dentist that randomly appeared.  I had a bad chip in my tooth that the dentist somehow didn't notice, but when I pointed it out to him he said he’d run out of time and left.  I came across my brother who had multiple cages of pets.  I tried to feed them but gave them the wrong food by mistake.",0,wild dream awhile back hi guy really enjoy keeping dream journal thought share crazy dream wrote group bad people chasing little kid path car dove blazing ring fire swooped front pursuer grew much brighter caused burn crisp kid saved burnt body remained long exact copy killed assailant appeared replace dead one happening ran back direction chased kid small property cabin went cabin door hallway side hallway could either go door left bathroom keep going end turn corner broader area house ran past bathroom around corner house locking door behind pursuer find felt threatened intimidated looking found cage house couple gecko rat reason thought pet felt like forgot year tried remember name rat severely attacked one gecko try stop scared rat shredding hand angry managed grab tail without attacking contempt flung across room hard could gecko dead pretty badly injured cut top lip missing removed cage desperately tried find item heal kept getting delayed finding anything needing teeth fixed dentist randomly appeared bad chip tooth dentist somehow notice pointed said run time left came across brother multiple cage pet tried feed gave wrong food mistake

On one side the sea was dark (left) and on the right side it was white. In between there was an old bridge. The bridge was very long and not wide at all. I couldn’t see where it ended, it was made out of wood and very old. 
My boyfriend told me “you probably can’t walk on that bridge, it would break” 

I watched a girl in a colorful dress walk over it as she was being recorded by a man. 
Her dress had the same color as the sky (pink, yellow, orange) 

I saw the moon on the left side of the bridge. It was also pink, yellow, orange. It had 4 symbols on it, the only one I remember is the peace sign on the bottom left.

775,Back to the future?,Dreams,"Had a dream last night that took place some amount of time in the future, not sure how much further, but the remaining humans (myself included) are captured and end up in a huge spacecraft of some kind. It is dark and dingy and resembles a large warehouse or garage but with many different rooms and areas.

We are chased and attacked by the government officials in charge of whatever this was. People all around me are dying, getting shot, stabbed, thrown. I manage to find a decent hiding spot and stay there while I listen to hundreds of people scream and die. Funny side note: on the way to this hiding spot I see one of my birds, a gray cockatiel, that passed away years ago just siting in a large cage against a wall.

I stay in my hiding spot while debris hits me from all angles, covering my head with my arms. Finally after a while, a man fully covered in a dark suit finds me and I yell as I assume I’m dead next. He grabs me and yanks me away to a a separate, clean room. Everything is different. No killing, no screaming. Lots of other unharmed people. It looks like a cruise ship now. I don’t know what to think. Others are walking around, not happily, but safely.

I realize I was in some sort of process of elimination, survival of the fittest test, and only those remaining were to be chosen for whatever life this is next. There are windows to the outside now, a little bigger than airplane windows, and the ones who just entered this place are looking out wondering what is happening. I look too, and the world below is sad and bare. The average daily temperature is 200 degrees and uninhabitable to most life we are briefed. (Not sure where I was before this ordeal, some other barely livable place.)

I step away from the window and look around. There are many different kinds of people left which is surprising to me. Some look like they have been here for a while. I wonder how they all made it past their elimination round. I was not very proud of my way in so I already felt inadequate.

I make my way past the living area and into the community sleeping area. A man around my age (late 20s) points out an unoccupied bed that I can use as mine. The area resembles a detention center with small cot-like beds, the floors are still concrete as they were before, but you have everything you need to be just comfortable enough. I chat with this man and he seems nice and decent. He’s also attractive. I think to myself, whatever this is, it’s my life now and I hope I make it.

780,HAHAH UH I talked to Anthony Bourdain,Dreams,"TW: suicide mention
Obviously not really him but it was weird. And comforting. And incredibly embarrassing!!
 I'm missing a lot of what happened.

I've always had an issue with depression and suicidal ideation is something I struggle with daily (I got that handled though); since I discovered his shows, years ago, I've felt some kind of kinship with Anthony and he's big part of why I wanted to be an anthropologist at one point. 
His death *fucked* me up. 

ANYWAY. 

In the dream, he is very much dead but we are conversing nonstop over the phone while I'm sitting at a table in an empty/closing restaurant. Either chatting through text or otherwise. I end up leaving and I remember being outside of a taqueria-style food truck, its raining, and telling that ""I would rather you here"" or something along those lines. Now I have an SO that I love very much but shit took a sexual turn after that? But somehow... deeper and existential? I wish I could remember the conversation rather than the feelings. Like there was a spiritual connection that defied death. 

I have my own theories but if you made it this far, what is your interpretation?

784,This was a Hectic Dream Too. I had it Sometime in 2018.,Dreams,"*I was sleeping in the upstairs bed alone when I had this terrible nightmare!* 

It began with me and some close girl friend. We were travelling together, and I remember walking down the street of an English town and sitting on a small wall next to the sidewalk to have lunch. 

Then we got on a bus, it was still bright and sunny. All was fine and well until I realised that Sam Winchester was in the front passenger seat! So, we went over, and I sat next to him. Then I look into the review mirror and saw Dean Winchester was driving the bus!

*“wait, if the Winchesters are here doesn’t that mean something supernatural is going to happen?”*

BOOM! With that thought the buss starts swerving out of control. The sunlight is flickering, I get out of my seat and look through the front window. There are smudges of bright grey in stark contrast to the rest of the black road – I know exactly what they are. 

The angles (from Doctor Who), they’ve found me. I mustn't look in their eyes, but every now and then the swerving buss seems to freeze, and I stare directly into their cold stone eyes.

**BOOM!** Out go the lights, it was day time but now it is complete dark not a single star in the sky. Then just as suddenly the light is back. The bus still swerves, I can see flashes of their faces getting closer!

...We stop. The buss has come to a complete halt. There is an angle directly in front of us, it must have stopped the bus. I know I cannot take my eyes off of it or it will move but – 

**BOOM!** The light flicks off for a solid second then back on - Its moved. its closer, its coming closer. 

**BOOM!** Darkness, light. I tell everyone not to blink, don’t blink but no one will listen, no one can hear me-

**BOOM!** Darkness, light. Oh god it’s in the buss, it’s only a few feet away from me. I am alone, they’re all gone, where has everybody gone? Did the angels get them? They must have!

**BOOM!** Darkness, light. The angle is directly in front of me now, its arms outstretched and its elongated teeth out on display in a fearsome, frozen screech. 

**BOOM!** Darkness, light. Its moved away, back in front of the bus, but it’s not alone anymore. The other angles have arrived and I’m seeing this now from outside my body. 

**BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!** The light is flickering on and off, strobe lights, the angles are jolting into different positions. I am watching from a bird’s eye view looking down, it’s as if they are dancing around in a circle.

Forcefully a rift is torn right at the centre, time and space pull apart and an eye emerges (the Prison Guard's eye in Doctor Who S5). As it moves forward its long silver worm-like neck (Prisoner 0’s body) is slowly emerging from this portal and I am suddenly thrust back into my helpless body.

It is taller than the bus! Reaching far into the sky beyond the limits of the window frame. It brings its eye down, I try not to move so I don’t attract its attention but it knows where I am and stares directly into my soul. It creeps closer, reminding me of the angle who followed a similar path not too long ago.

I don’t know what it wants from me, but I don’t want it coming any closer. I’m afraid of what it might do.

I don’t want this anymore – *and so I wake myself up.*

*Startled, I realise that I am at home. Alone. it’s still dark. 3am. Now, I must now try to get back to sleep without envisioning the silver hand creeping out from the darkness as I close my eyes and leave my body entirely defenceless.*",0,hectic dream sometime sleeping upstairs bed alone terrible nightmare began close girl friend travelling together remember walking street english town sitting small wall next sidewalk lunch got bus still bright sunny fine well realised sam winchester front passenger seat went sat next look review mirror saw dean winchester driving bus wait winchester mean something supernatural going happen boom thought bus start swerving control sunlight flickering get seat look front window smudge bright grey stark contrast rest black road know exactly angle doctor found look eye every swerving bus seems freeze stare directly cold stone eye boom go light day time complete dark single star sky suddenly light back bus still swerve see flash face getting closer stop bus come complete halt angle directly front u must stopped bus know cannot take eye move boom light flick solid second back moved closer coming closer boom darkness light tell everyone blink blink one listen one hear boom darkness light oh god bus foot away alone gone everybody gone angel get must boom darkness light angle directly front arm outstretched elongated teeth display fearsome frozen screech boom darkness light moved away back front bus alone anymore angle arrived seeing outside body boom boom boom light flickering strobe light angle jolting different position watching bird eye view looking dancing around circle forcefully rift torn right centre time space pull apart eye emerges prison guard eye doctor move forward long silver worm like neck prisoner body slowly emerging portal suddenly thrust back helpless body taller bus reaching far sky beyond limit window frame brings eye try move attract attention know stare directly soul creep closer reminding angle followed similar path long ago know want want coming closer afraid might want anymore wake startled realise home alone still dark must try get back sleep without envisioning silver hand creeping darkness close eye leave body entirely defenceless
785,A weird and disturbing dream,Dreams,"I had a really weird dream (although i always do, this one was extra weird) I dont remember much of it but i remember a few parts. I was walking down a sidewalk near my school, I picked up a piece of paper and a red pen. I wrote something on the paper although i do not know what, only that i had the intention on cursing someone with misfortune or death. I continued t8 walk down the sidewalk until i cake across a trashcan. I threw away the pen and paper into the can and i turned to walk away. As i was turning i saw a short woman who was staring at me and gave me the most evil and twisted grin I ever saw, the kind of grin that makes your stomach turn. I saw her and i quickly walked back where i came from and into a building. The inside of the building was dark and there were isles of shelves (like in stores) that held toys and clothes that looked as if someone just threw them at the shelves. I went into one of the isles which were so close together only one person could go in at a time and it would still be tight, and i saw that woman. She looked about 5'4 in height and maybe about 20. She wore short shorts and a long sleeved sweater. When i walked into her in that isle she gave me some really creepy, evil, twisted smile and then challenged me to a sword fight with plastic katanas to see how fast i could hit her and she even shown me a paper that tells you a certain way to swing the plastic swords super fast. Then we began our duel in the messy, tight, old closet smelling isles in the dark building. She swung fast and hit me hard but i swung faster and hit her face repeatedly. All of a sudden it was like her face busted open and i mean it looked like someone stomped her head in. She covered her face and started sobbing. I looked at her and saw no blood nor fleshy bits. It looked like she was made of plastic on the inside and a voice box attached to a cord was hanging out of he face. I was so scared and confused. I asked her if she was ok but then she started screaming at me. Not the kind of screaming you'd hear from someone angry or the spoiled brat kind of scream, no it sounded like she was in pain, a ton of pain, it sounded like someone torturing her and she couldnt do anything. I tried to grab her arm and she did that horrible scream again and quickly ran away, hiding her face with plastic hanging out of it.Then i stood there shaken, confused, and scared.
The dream ended there when i woke up to the smell of bacon.

Also, she didnt look like plastic on the outside only the inside, she looked like a normal human outside.",0,weird disturbing dream really weird dream although always one extra weird dont remember much remember part walking sidewalk near school picked piece paper red pen wrote something paper although know intention cursing someone misfortune death continued walk sidewalk cake across trashcan threw away pen paper turned walk away turning saw short woman staring gave evil twisted grin ever saw kind grin make stomach turn saw quickly walked back came building inside building dark isle shelf like store held toy clothes looked someone threw shelf went one isle close together one person could go time would still tight saw woman looked height maybe wore short short long sleeved sweater walked isle gave really creepy evil twisted smile challenged sword fight plastic katanas see fast could hit even shown paper tell certain way swing plastic sword super fast began duel messy tight old closet smelling isle dark building swung fast hit hard swung faster hit face repeatedly sudden like face busted open mean looked like someone stomped head covered face started sobbing looked saw blood fleshy bit looked like made plastic inside voice box attached cord hanging face scared confused asked ok started screaming kind screaming hear someone angry spoiled brat kind scream sounded like pain ton pain sounded like someone torturing couldnt anything tried grab arm horrible scream quickly ran away hiding face plastic hanging stood shaken confused scared dream ended woke smell bacon also didnt look like plastic outside inside looked like normal human outside
786,Protecting people I have grievances with from a mass murderer,Dreams,"For some reason I was back with my ex girlfriend and we were going for a night with friends and family in a country house we had rented. When we arrived at the house everyone who was there wether it be friend or family I have a grievance with in waking life.

During the conversation we both hear a noise and look at each other then we hear the noise again and realise it’s gunshots and run to the kitchen, people start to follow and my brother being selfish tries to not let them in however I open the door and let them in. I’m sat in the corner with my brother under the counter when a quad bike starts to drive past slowly with the gunman looking through the windows. All of a sudden I notice the door in the hallway that leads outside is hatred open and race to shut it before the gunman returns locking the exterior kitchen door on the way, I’m racing to lock the door as he rides past and dive under the counter however we make eye contact. For some reason he doesn’t seem to be bothered about me and doesn’t try to enter the house unbeknownst to him the rest of the room is filled with most of the other people and we survive until morning. The next day we find out that he had killed 3 people when he got into the house upstairs, we also found out about a mass murder a mile away the same day we had been attacked at a horse racing meeting in the morning. we return home and that’s where the dream ended.

I dreamed I was in a hidden area of a video game, a grassy, hilly area with an apple tree at one end. Semi-lucid, I realized I could eat an apple here without my allergy kicking in. I laughed and picked the small green apple and bit into it. Oh, the flavor! I haven’t had an apple in years, but this one was delicious!

And then the character next to me said, “No! That’s an assassin’s apple!” Indeed, this hidden area was an assassin’s hideout DLC for TES4 Oblivion, and I was about to die. “Whoops!” I said and watched my health bar dip down, rise back up, dip down more, rise up less, and inch closer to death in spurts.

793,Another strange dream.,Dreams,"I was on a swing in the middle of those parks you find in Russia/Ukraine, those in-between giant flat blocks.

Unfortunately, like all dreams, I forgot more and more so I probably butchered the thing the magic voice said. Does anyone know what this could mean?

Note: There was sort of relaxing music with a voice like Alan Watts, I think it's an Atlantic accent they used for TV/radio voices back in the 80-'s or '90s.

She was just amazing, and I never felt so happy in my entire life. She was gorgeous, but not what I would regularly consider 'my type'. I don't know what this means, so I wanted to ask here.

798,Dreamt that Greta Thunberg washed my car.,Dreams,"I dreamt that as I got back to the parking lot at the mall, Greta Thunberg was just finishing washing my car. Actually she hadn't done such a good job, so I moved the car across the street where she'd have more space! Without me saying anything, she could tell I was disappointed. But then she said she didn't want to wash it there, because it was a dodgy area and outside of the parking lot. She said I could move it back to the original spot and she'd wash it again there.

I felt quite shitty about the fact that a 16 year old girl was washing my car. Not to mention that she was GRETA THUNBERG. So I asked if I could buy her a soft drink. She gratefully said yes. It was kind of weird to me that she would drink out of a plastic bottle like an ordinary human. Don't know what I expected, I guess I kind of expected her to be like a priestess or a minor deity.

My interpretation: I basically see Greta as representing my inner child. Apparently I'm still not treating my inner child very well, but at least it stood up for itself a bit and I did buy it a soft drink.",0,dreamt greta thunberg washed car dreamt got back parking lot mall greta thunberg finishing washing car actually done good job moved car across street space without saying anything could tell disappointed said want wash dodgy area outside parking lot said could move back original spot wash felt quite shitty fact year old girl washing car mention greta thunberg asked could buy soft drink gratefully said yes kind weird would drink plastic bottle like ordinary human know expected guess kind expected like priestess minor deity interpretation basically see greta representing inner child apparently still treating inner child well least stood bit buy soft drink

I was outside my apartment smoking with my roommate. It was like a replay of an actual reality check I did in real life that I distinctly remember, but this time when I looked at my hands and asked ""am I dreaming?"", my wrist had 2 tattoos of playing cards on them (I dont have any tattoos). After I did that, everything became incredibly vivid, and I felt completely in control, but I didnt know if i was in a dream or not yet, so i thought about it for a second and looked around, but everything looked SO real that for some reason i just brushed off the possibility of it being a dream and said ""nah this is real life"". After that, my dream went back to normal. How can I convince myself I'm really dreaming after a reality check? I feel like I definitely should have become aware of it after seeing the tattoos, but I definitely underestimated how real a dream can feel, and how hard it is to remember what reality is like.",0,almost lucid dream night ago need advice reality check lot lately think dream night ago tried remind one outside apartment smoking roommate like replay actual reality check real life distinctly remember time looked hand asked dreaming wrist tattoo playing card dont tattoo everything became incredibly vivid felt completely control didnt know dream yet thought second looked around everything looked real reason brushed possibility dream said nah real life dream went back normal convince really dreaming reality check feel like definitely become aware seeing tattoo definitely underestimated real dream feel hard remember reality like

802,Strange dark dream,Dreams," Somewhere that I recognized, I had been there before in a dream. Small building with a few rooms. Colourful bookshelves, some large red vending type machine. I stand next to it and see this small dragonfly, except it's not an insect. I look closer and it's a little drone, looking the vending machine up and down.

 I talk to someone with blonde hair, a man I know. I offer him some spare computer parts, but he says he appreciates what I gave him last time, and he's used all those parts, only now their operation is larger and he doesn't need anything I have. I don't know what they do. I remember giving him parts the last time I was there, but the place was more run down.

 There is a subway in the building with a hanging florescent sign nearby. It sways mechanically, with a camera on each end of the sign. But it hits the building swaying too far. It keeps hitting the building, making a banging sound that no one cares about. 

 In the same building. It's night time now, I'm looking in a room with three sleeping children, an infant, a toddler and a young child, sleeping in their bed with their father. Two men are sneaking into the room, im looking through the eyes of one of them. Or I am one of them, I'm not sure. One has a weapon drawn, pistol it looks like. Thoughts come to me ""obviously youngest to oldest"". One man shoots the infant in the head, it's almost silent, more like a paintball gun. A small coin like object hits and sticks to the infants head and I know it's dead. The toddler stirs and the man quickly shoots another coin onto his head. I know he's dead too. The older child lays quietly still sleeping and the man pulls the trigger point blank, except the device doesn't work. Nothing comes out, he fiddles with it momentarily and then tries again. It works and he kills the third child. He tries to shoot the father but the weapon stops working, or is out of ammunition. I'm not sure which, he can't get it working again. The father wakes up and realizes what has happened in an instant. I'm looking through the father's eyes now or I am him, but I know I have to kill the man with the gun. I grab him by the neck and choke him with all my might, feeling my fingers digging into his flesh and wrapping around his trachea. I know I'm going to kill him quickly but someone stops me. I immediately acknowledge that I should stop, and am directed out of the room. I discuss the happenings with someone I know, and recall that something similar happened with 'kaylas kids in that other reality' I'm referring to my wife kayla. I'm upset but maybe pretending to be upset because I should be? Then I wake up.

 I'm mostly disturbed by this dream because I have 2 young boys, an infant and a toddler. I am hesitant to tell my wife about it.

804,Multi-Level Dreams? - I had one that was FIVE LEVELS DEEP.,Dreams,"I'm wondering if others have had Multi-Level Dreams, and by that I mean a dream within a dream. 

When I was in college, probably influenced by inhaled herbs, I had a dream that was FIVE LEVELS DEEP. Though to be fair going up, that is going into the dreams, some of them were simply me in bed having another dream.

For example, in my level-1 dream, I dreamed I was laying in bed having my level-2 dream, an so on. On this particular night, that's how the sequence got started. I was laying in bed dreaming that I was laying in bed dreaming, and at each level I dreamed another dream up to Five Levels. Though this has been years ago, so all the dreams aren't clear any more, but in the last (5th) Level, myself and a nondescript person were trapped in an old log cabinet, and a posse of bad cowboys with guns on horses were approaching. We escaped out a secret trap door, went down to the river and escaped by river in a canoe just as the bad guys approached the Cabinet. 

Then I started falling down through the levels, Level-5 (cabin) fell into Level-4 then into Level-3 down until I was literally falling in Level-1. Just as I was about to hit the ground, or whatever surface I was falling toward, I woke up. 

Though mostly my dreams are just short flashed, more like passing thoughts, many times in my life I have had very long complex dreams. I remember one that started with me at a party in my Mother's house with the University Swim Team then transitioned to me driving on a road filled with huge pot-holes and after a lot more complex surreal insanity, ended with me practicing Karate in an invisible house.

805,Dreams & the Protection of St Benedict,Dreams,"TL;DR Medel of Saint Benedict works in dreams, too.

I'm a lucid dreamer and usually have _at least_ a small measure of control over my dreams when I'm not just sitting back and watching them like a movie as they play out on their own. After my dad passed away a couple years ago, I immediately began having dreams with him in them, and they were almost always nightmarish. I haven't had a nightmare since I was five years old and discovered I had control of my dreams (haha, who's the Dream Master now, Freddy?!), so these dreams were, for me, extremely unusual and very disturbing, not the least due to their hellish content but because my usual powerset (see appendix) had no effect on them. Every time I went to sleep, I would dream about my dad, and every time he would die again and again but in a worse way than he actually had, or he would be suffering. In many of them I would try to fight back and assert control by saying outloud in the dreams that he didn't die like this, or that this dream character trying to convince me they were my dad actually was not. But no matter how much I tried to reassert control and fight back, it was all pointless because nothing worked. It got to the point where I would stay up later and later and would fight going to sleep because, once asleep, I didn't know what I would see or how bad it would be.

One of my coworkers and best friends is a devout Catholic. While I hold religious and spiritual views myself, I am not fully familiar with the ins and outs of Catholicism. One day at work, while apparently looking like the zombie I felt like, he asked me what was wrong and I told him about the dreams. Without blinking an eye, he reaches into his pocket, pulls out a medal, and hands it to me. ""Wear this on a chain or something. It needs to touch you. At least wear it to bed. It should help."" What he had given me was a medal of Saint Benedict, the patron Saint of Exorcism. On one side of the coin is an image of Benedict, and on the other is a seal consisting of the prayer of Saint Benedict. In short, think of it like a constant protection from evil and evil things, to paraphrase D&D. He explained to me that he thought the nightmares were demonic in origin and sounded very much like some _thing_ or _things_ had noticed the grief from the loss of my dad and were trying to capitalize in it through the bad dreams. He insisted that, if his theory was correct, I would know immediately.

I went home that night, exhausted after weeks of poor sleep and, wearing the medal on an old leather cord, I went to bad. I then had one of the first dreams with my dad since his passing where he was healthy and whole, and I knew beyond the shadow of a doubt that **this was my dad**. The dream consisted of someone knocking on my bedroom door, and on opening the door I found my dad _on the other side_. And don't think I fail to see the irony or the symbolism in that. He was young and healthy, looking as he did when I was a little kid. He hugged me and told me that he was OK, that I didn't have to have the bad dreams anymore, _don't sweat the small stuff, kid,_ and that everything was going to work out OK. He then told me that he had to go but he'd be back, and that he loved me. As he stepped back through the door, I woke up.

I told my coworker about the difference the next day and he firmly believed his theory was correct. He suggested that, if I wanted to go a step further, I could put a medal over each door leading into the house and they would block negative things from getting in. I then went to an Abby, bought a grip of Benedictine medals, had them blessed by a priest, and put them over the doors in my house, in my mom & dad's house, and put one on my keychain, and on my mom's. My sister wears hers like like a charm on a bracelet.

The bad dreams about my dad had stopped outright, but I found that I had then started having dreams instead about entities or demons trying to get in, but now I have I defense, and in every case I am able to cast them out without issue. These dreams are few and far between now, but they happen occasionally, and when they do I sometimes find them amusing, and then I fight back.

**Appendix**

Some background for reference: I'm a lucid dreamer, and I almost always have the same set of powers in any dreams. I'll list what those powers are for me and describe some of the terminology I will use in the above and future texts (I plan to write more about my dreams). There are rules and limitations for my dream abilities that I have discovered over 20 years. I don't know why these rules or limitations exist, or why they are similar to D&D rules (this was the case before I ever knew anything about D&D), they just are.

I have future posts planned and will place this section at the bottom of each one and add to it where necessary once I get into some heavier content.

**Rewind** to redo a scene, like in a movie.

**Fast Forward** to see how a scene will work out and then apply **Rewind**.

**Invisibility** requires minimal concentration, doesn't always last long.

**Incorporeality** or **Phasing** through walls or solid objects. Requires concentration, also a short term use ability, sometimes is combined with **Invisibility**.

**Possession** where I inhabit the body of a Dream Character, a character that is obviously not me, and play through their story from their perspective while influencing their actions but not with complete control of them or the dream. 

**Teleport** or **Jump** from one dream to the next. Moderate concentration, can lead to waking up. 

**Wake Up** is exactly what it implies: I can wake up at will if the SHTF and the dream is unrecoverable.

**Dream Characters** are _not_ me, I generally have _no_ control over them without using **Possession** (which is rare), they are their own persons and do what they want. Basic Dream Characters don't talk much, they tend to be like background NPCs much of the time. They can sometimes appear as someone I know, someone from a film, TV show, book, etc, but are still basically NPCs and aren't usually very active or smart and won't carry on a conversation no matter how much I try.

**Advanced Dream Characters** are still Dream Characters, but these are extremely intelligent and autonomous, like real people, and they don't happen often. I sometimes have interactions with them and have my doubts about them being Dream Characters at all, and they are all different. Sometimes I carry on conversations, exchange ideas, or even battle these people.",0,dream protection st benedict tl dr medel saint benedict work dream lucid dreamer usually least small measure control dream sitting back watching like movie play dad passed away couple year ago immediately began dream almost always nightmarish nightmare since five year old discovered control dream haha dream master freddy dream extremely unusual disturbing least due hellish content usual powerset see appendix effect every time went sleep would dream dad every time would die worse way actually would suffering many would try fight back assert control saying outloud dream die like dream character trying convince dad actually matter much tried reassert control fight back pointless nothing worked got point would stay later later would fight going sleep asleep know would see bad would one coworkers best friend devout catholic hold religious spiritual view fully familiar in out catholicism one day work apparently looking like zombie felt like asked wrong told dream without blinking eye reach pocket pull medal hand wear chain something need touch least wear bed help given medal saint benedict patron saint exorcism one side coin image benedict seal consisting prayer saint benedict short think like constant protection evil evil thing paraphrase explained thought nightmare demonic origin sounded much like thing thing noticed grief loss dad trying capitalize bad dream insisted theory correct would know immediately went home night exhausted week poor sleep wearing medal old leather cord went bad one first dream dad since passing healthy whole knew beyond shadow doubt dad dream consisted someone knocking bedroom door opening door found dad side think fail see irony symbolism young healthy looking little kid hugged told ok bad dream anymore sweat small stuff kid everything going work ok told go back loved stepped back door woke told coworker difference next day firmly believed theory correct suggested wanted go step could put medal door leading house would block negative thing getting went abby bought grip benedictine medal blessed priest put door house mom dad house put one keychain mom sister wear like like charm bracelet bad dream dad stopped outright found started dream instead entity demon trying get defense every case able cast without issue dream far happen occasionally sometimes find amusing fight back appendix background reference lucid dreamer almost always set power dream list power describe terminology use future text plan write dream rule limitation dream ability discovered year know rule limitation exist similar rule case ever knew anything future post planned place section bottom one add necessary get heavier content rewind redo scene like movie fast forward see scene work apply rewind invisibility requires minimal concentration always last long incorporeality phasing wall solid object requires concentration also short term use ability sometimes combined invisibility possession inhabit body dream character character obviously play story perspective influencing action complete control dream teleport jump one dream next moderate concentration lead waking wake exactly implies wake shtf dream unrecoverable dream character generally control without using possession rare person want basic dream character talk much tend like background npc much time sometimes appear someone know someone film tv show book etc still basically npc usually active smart carry conversation matter much try advanced dream character still dream character extremely intelligent autonomous like real people happen often sometimes interaction doubt dream character different sometimes carry conversation exchange idea even battle people

I then went to check the fur under my dog’s neck, that was when something suddenly fell out from there to the ground.  I realized it was an insect the size of a cellphone that appears to be a hybrid of all those bugs I’ve mentioned.

The bug started crawling around in creepily fast speed, I screamed and cried as I tried to dodge it. Then suddenly, it flew into the air and went straight into my face. I screamed and jolted awake in sweat and tears...

813,Anyone with dreams like mine? Serious post.,Dreams,"Ok, bare with me and don't start ranting, I know how this sounds, just here to clear up my mind. 

Long story short, when I was around 11 I dreamt of my dad (whom I haven't seen since around 4) few days later, dead in a plane crash. Nothing to be alarmed, as a kid, I didn't think too much of it. Three years ago, dreamt of my grandmother, only to wake up and have my mom call with the news that she passed during the night. Mmmkay...
Last year, a good friend was diagnosed with cancer and I dreamt her only to find out that she died as well. 

All dreams were vivid but I had no control and I can still remember somewhat parts of it. I try to shake it off that stuff like this is not really something proven or accepted, keep telling myself that maybe it was a memory created after the facts but I told my gf what I dreamt before I got the call from my mom. It's been really bothering me and I know that stuff like this is probably not something that science is into, even talking about shit like this is most likely to be shaken off by someone with a decent understanding of scientific evidence and prof. I'll probably do if didn't experienced it. 

So before I start digging some shitposts and shady spiritual blogs, has anyone been thorough something similar? Not really interested in hearing that your gypsy grandmother was talking to the dead, but rather if anyone has something similar to share that they've experienced and they can't explain it. 

May also be interested in analysing whatever the hell this may be (no idea how yet) if I'm not the only odd fella.

815,2 Dreams # 12 - 15 my dreams start to connect with each other in a weird way,Dreams,"So in this dream I was in my dad's home and I was laying on my bed when i heard some weird noise so i rolled over to my right to see what was happening and I saw water start to come from the floor,

So i get up and tell my dad (now I forgot some of what I said but I'll try to remember the best I can)

""Hey I think you need to do something about the foundation of the home""

I forgot some of the stuff after that but then what happens is that I get a very uneasy feeling and I see the bed start to move so I go outside to run away from it,

But then this girl come to me and I forgot exactly what happened but I immediately had this courage and I was then aware I was dreaming but j went back in the house and back in where the water was and when I was in the room I stood in front of the door frame and lifted my left hand as to bring the water up and out, but I stretched out my right hand to the bathroom where some light bulbs were unplugged and as there was the water spout I didn't want what was in the water to kill me so I put my right hand from the light sockets to the water spout as electricity came from the sockets to the water killing all in it and then the water flooded the room and everything went black,

But I could still hear and speak as I could feel the presence of the girl that came earlier and I said something which I don't remember and she then said

""I have to go do something""

Then there was a pause as I then felt a peck on my right cheek

And after doing something which I forgot what it was, so we were running back to the car with some zombies chasing us but for some reason I couldn't run but walk so when I reached the car and opened the door for some reason I became lucid again and I remembered the last dream I had (2 dreams # 12) a what I did so i reached out my arm and as the zombie was right in front of me I focused really hard to kill it before it did me,

So as I'm trying to kill the zombie I freeze it and it cant move as long as my arm is stretched out to it, so after awhile I see my vision warm a bit as the place changes colors and after a bit of that I see its head twist but nothing else.

Then I wake up

(This is a really short dream btw and this is from around 2012-2014 if I can remember correctly)

So in this dream I was walking around my house trying to find something to eat but when I would find food the black spiders would immediately come and eat up all of the food.

So in this dream I'm in this store and I'm trying to find something I can't remember when I then start seeing these toys and seeing these people make clones of them selves (i think these were kids i cant remember) and I say

""Aw i wish i had clones of me""

Then the same girl from 2 Dreams # 12 came in front of me and grabbed the back of my head and said ""why don't we make some?"" And then she kissed me and then it turned very awkward with the most cheesy music i have ever heard (the Hollywood love songs) and I'm in my mind trying to change the song (to twinkle twinkle little star) as I then see someone laughing at me and because of how awkward and cringey the whole situation just got.

819,Interpret my dream,Dreams,"Had a strange dream last night. 

Got up and out of bed. Looked out my window and saw the woods. It seemed to be midday. Then a white wave like a tsunami came crashing down from behind a hill and was high enough to come down through the tawny Autumn leaves of the canopy. The force of the impact destroyed the wall to my room, creating a giant gap to the outside. Dust and soil was kicked into the air. It was chaotic. The white wall was a giant flock of sheep. After plummeting to the ground they were now in a full on stampede. They were being pursued by wolves. Running to preserve their lives as the wolves chased them with tongues lolling out of their mouths. After a minute or two the sheep and wolves ran into the distance. The chase continued elsewhere and the dust began to settle. A lagging wolf approached me and entered my room through the gap. It had a visible wound on its right rear quarters. It lamely lunged at me. Perhaps thinking I would be easier to catch than sheep. After manuvering around it I grabbed the wolf under its throat with my left hand and pinned its back against the wall close to where the wall met the floor, so that the wolf was bent in an ""L"" like shape. Standing over it I gripped a knife with my right hand and plunged it into the wolf's neck, killing it.

822,Swam the River Styx?,Dreams,"I was in a large airplane. Something reminiscent of an AC-130. I opened a door on the side and looked down. I could see my body, it was old and wrinkled. The body of an 80 year old man. 

There was a mist that shrouded the horizon, I couldn’t see beyond it. It was thick white, and gave off a kind of glow as if refracting sunlight. 

But the water was the most amazing thing. Within the mist ran a huge river and the plane was flying down it, just 40 or 50 feet off the surface. The water was amazing. It had a strange viscosity to it and was the most incredible hues of blue, green, yellow and brown. 

I jumped out of the plane, angling my body with its velocity, pointing my toes. I plunged deep beneath the surface at a perfect angle. When I surfaced my skin was taught. I was young again, the age I am now. I swept my hair back and enjoyed a backstroke, a freestroke. 

Before long I noticed there was a man in his mid 40s with a perfectly pruned beard swimming with me. I smiled at him. He smiled back. 

“Finally one of us eh?” He said. 

“Feels good.” I responded.

823,Aliens,Dreams,"This dreams was all night, involved a meteorite breaking up in the atmosphere dropping five small very small aliens, no larger than a quarter. I was recruited by the government to make contact with these aliens and find them as I said they are small.

The first one was found in a greenhouse, upon meeting the alien it motioned for me to extend my arms. I stuck my right arm out and the alien morphed into a liquid state and propelled itself towards my arm, melting into my skin and giving it a strange look. I could hear it in my head as if telepathic. The longer the dream went on the more extreme the changes to my arm were. I had vines begin to come out of one small section of only that arm and into another. I was told I now have power over plants. Thus I aimed my arm at a tomato plant and concentrated, the tomato grew and the plant as well.

Another alien was located in a city type location, same thing, however this one was yellow and it gave me power over electricity with almost small mushroom like stalks extending from my should and upper arm, that would change location and grow depending on use.

There was a purple, a blue, and a red.

I could see this almost like a HUD inventory from a video game when I wanted to know about them.

I never found the other aliens, and at the end of the dream I just basically pushed them from my arms with my hand very easily. Afterwords they died.

Then I woke up.

824,Several strange dreams lately,Dreams,"I’ve suddenly started remembering my dreams very well and I’ve even been partly self-aware for some of them. They’ve become very realistic with just one weird element to most of them, and they are usually pretty short. Here’s four of the most prominent ones:

I’m driving into a parking lot, and I see two free spots: one beside Luigi and one beside Waluigi. I choose Luigi.

I’m just laying in my bed, a perfect recreation of my room and everything. I look at the time and it says 15:01, and I think to myself ‘it’s getting late and I should go to bed.’ The dream ends when I guess I went to bed.

A man I have never seen before is chasing me around my yard(another perfect recreation), trying to put a bug that resembles a green cockroach on me.

I’m reading an article on my phone about a music artist I like. It says, as close as I can remember, “She was very bold to name her album “Period.” Only two people have named their songs that before, one being [name I can’t remember] who got attacked by a fan, and the other being Oprah, who, not taking any crap, took out her gun and held it to the person who tried to attack her.” I read it and get a weird feeling, remembering that the artist the article was about did not have an album named “Period.”

825,Dreamt about my ex girlfriend,Dreams,"Girlfriend broke up with me 5 days ago. All I can do is think about her. Last night I dreamt that I was driving to school (I used to drive her with me, her house was on the way) and her and her brother were in her car driving at an intersection near her house. All of a sudden I get out of my car, decide to take the bus at the stop at that intersection to get to school, and so does she, but she avoids me completely. She sees me but she avoids me. The dream just ended there, but then I had another dream that I was Batman, she was my ex-wife, we had two kids, and planned on being with a new guy, who ended up being the bad guy in the dream. He planned on kidnapping her and the kids and living on a cruise ship. I put on the mask and a gray tuxedo and fought him at a giant party he was hosting in his huge mansion, she and kids were happy that they weren't getting kidnapped, and the dream ended. 

I've tried asking her to get back together, I know I messed up a lot but she absolutely refuses to give me another chance to fix everything. Can anyone analyze these dreams? Tell me what they mean?

826,[Re-upload] I Threatened To Rape My Greatest Fear/Nightmare Gets interrupted by Lucid Dreaming MLG Memes,Dreams,"[This is a re-upload of a very crazy bizarre set of dreams I had when I was younger, I uploaded it on the Lucid Dreaming subreddit almost a year ago. I took it down out of pure embarrassment as I didn't think it would get that much attention, someone uploaded it to the copypasta subreddit because of how shitposty it sounds, but here you go, enjoy] 

""So when I was younger I was afraid of those Heffalumps from Winnie the Pooh and kept having nightmares about it. That was until I learned about rape when I was 9, that really showed him! So basically the dream begins with me in a theater watching a play, don't know why, but I do. I suddenly realized I had homework and that this was bullshit. I then saw a Heffalump come towards me and opened his mouth to reveal sharp, jagged, bloody teeth. But then I said ""I'M GOING TO F**KING RAPE YOU!!!"". I chased him around the theater and he screamed like a bitch. I chased it up the walls, through the roof and finally when I got ahold of it, I woke up.

Another string of dreams that ended were ones that occured when I was about 12. I continuously dreamt about Winnie the Pooh characters dying and me getting blamed for it. That changed one night. Before I went to bed I watched MLG compilations (you can see where this is going). So I dreamt the same scenario but with a twist, it went something like this:

Rabbit: Oh God, Pooh, you're DEAD!!!

(Pans to de-fluffed Pooh)

Rabbit: It's YOU (Insert Name Here)!!! I'm gonna send you to jail for the rest of your life!!!

(Lucid realization begins)

(Rabbit runs towards me)

Me: S M O K E W E E D E V E R Y D A Y!

Rabbit: What did you just say?

Me: S M O K E W E E D E V E R Y D A Y

(MLG Sanic theme begins to play)

Me: (Does SM64 Backflip)

So I do a backflip and jump onto a Sanic, a crapton of memes shower across my view as I boost into each Winnie The Pooh character, making each one explode, I then encounter a Heffalump.

Me (Suddenly Terry Crews): FULL SPEED, POWEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEERRRRRR!!!!

(Purple Elephant dude (Heffalump) explodes)

The End

What does it mean?!?""

But I'm coming here today to ask if anyone can add their input into a dream my grandmother had about me. 

Dream:

Last night she says she was in her previous house as her younger self, couldn't recall what she was doing but she knew she was at her old house. She then stepped out of the living room only to see my great grandmother (Her mother in law/now deceased) come through the front door carrying me (like a child thats is asleep) in her arms and started making her way upstairs. To which she completely broke down and started crying in the dream begging for her to let go of me. During the crying she added that my great grandmother had stopped on the 8th step (weirdly specific info) turned around for a minute and i had woken up and simply waved goodbye to my grandma and my great grandma just continued to go up the steps later into a room. She then ran after my great grandmother and tried going into the room only to wake up before she actually opened the door. 

Thats all haha, keep in mind as my grandma was her younger self she still saw me at my current age 

I don't know what to make of it, any input is appreciated

832,I had a dream that a child showed me his murder victim,Dreams,"I was nannying for this child (about 7yrs old) when he showed me the body of his brother's friend that has been missing for days. He acted so nonchalantly and at first I wasn't really bothered. I acted like everything was normal, but got increasingly stressed that he was gonna kill me next because I knew about the body. 

I tried looking up what to do on the internet by asking vague questions so that if he saw my search history, he wouldn't get worried that I was gonna out him (I was terrified that he would get out of prison and want revenge in the future). Strange enough, I came across a video specifically for this issue - it said to bring him to a group of people and shoot him ""accidentally"" whilst trying to shoot somebody who was gonna report him to the police.

I eventually decided on spraying my hands with his mother's perfume, bringing his clothes to his room and dropping some on the floor, giving the illusion that his mother discovered the body under his bed whilst picking up his washing.

I think I should really find a film with similar themes cuz I'll probably enjoy it!",0,dream child showed murder victim nannying child yr old showed body brother friend missing day acted nonchalantly first really bothered acted like everything normal got increasingly stressed gonna kill next knew body tried looking internet asking vague question saw search history get worried gonna terrified would get prison want revenge future strange enough came across video specifically issue said bring group people shoot accidentally whilst trying shoot somebody gonna report police eventually decided spraying hand mother perfume bringing clothes room dropping floor giving illusion mother discovered body bed whilst picking washing think really find film similar theme cuz probably enjoy
833,You Keep Me Hangin' On: the truest dream,Dreams,"I was hanging out with Tom Cruise after we both were somehow simultaneously retired from acting, characters in a movie, and also currently acting in a film shoot with no script. We had an argument in a coffeeshop where our lips weren't matching up. I think we knew we were in a dream, but that didn't make the film we were filming/living/notfilming any less real. 


I wanted to see what the movie was all about so I told Tom we would have to split and see which of us the ""camera"" followed. I think by ""camera"" I meant you, the audience of the dream. Not just me, timelighter the dreamer, but **you**, whoever you are.


I also realized I was a celebrity but I didn't recognize which one I was, so I had to figure that out. As I walked to my hot red sports car that sometimes flickered between convertible and not, I realized Tom Cruise was headed in a never-again-intersecting ray, and I would never see him again.


I went to my [timelighter's] apartment and was surprised by:

1. the mess of unfocusable items that maybe were blurry boxes of fuzzy things
2. The huge pile of bills and yellowed newspapers with dates that were always further in the past every time I checked
3. no lights or electricity or sunlight (even though it was daytime and the windows were open) except for one: the glow of my monitor, which was somehow a 90s CRT

4. my drunk landlord spilled out on the floor (who was someone I had never seen before)

5. an eviction notice

I read a few medical bills and realized they were all for my landlord, under my name. Except I couldn't remember my name so I'm not sure how I knew that this name was my name and not the landlord's.... except that... I think he had a key? Or it was a key card? Or was it a envelope? It's got something velvety... it's a keycard! Oh even better... 

it was an invitation to an exclusive party

ooh, party with celebrities! How nice... wait, aren't I a celebrity? Or just not yet? Not here?

Then I was sad because I realized Tom Cruise could not be there.

I helped prop up the drunk landlord up and then I *merged into his body*

I flipped the eviction notice around, which meant it was now only going to get me kicked out of here in the future, which can never be now

I knew I would see my apartment again when I woke up, but I was scared because I was convinced that the eviction notice was real, even though I knew I was dreaming

I decided to push aside my fears and powerwalk to this exclusive party.

I followed the invitation's pull and it lead me right to a industrial warehouse in the center of the city. Abandoned, I thought.

Until I walked in and realized **it was a metaphysical rave before an Industrial Motown Prog-Rock band playing a nonstop cover of [You Keep Me Hangin' On](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3bjMtqpGBw).**

There were no singers, just dancers and blocky mechanical instrumentalists. Imagine a Wall of Sound that pulses layers of ferrous awareness into you and your bodies, massive and unyielding and silly and **steady.** And somehow I could hear the words. 

And everyone was into it. And it was the truest shit I'd ever heard or seen.

And the air smelled like rubber shoes....

I won't describe the ravers to you, because it was very special and you have both be invited, steal an invitation, and just wander in. It was a wonderful mindless ****physical**** dance party, bodies supremely focused on The Beat, almost like zombies eating rhythms instead of brains. 

Time must have frozen, because it felt like dozens of hours had passed while watched the ravers. There was a perpetual, unstoppable, redundantly smooth ""smoothness"" to the way time was flowing. 

Everybody was a unit. They were probably all the same person, spiritually. Nobody talked; everybody just danced, individual limbs on a single breathing beast. Except... I was a moving part... I could cross-swim my dance moves through the crowd... I had to search for Tom after all! I would never see him again, but somehow I knew he was there. And so I swam on.

You should wake up now and *stop reading this*. It's only secret info from here on.


I will say this: I both did and didn't find him. Tomboy, that is. You see... it turned out that *I* was actually Tom Cruise, who the camera had followed. I was also timelighter. And sometimes I was Woody Harrelson. It didn't really matter. ***We just danced.***

Eventually my active memory ceased (my theory is that this dream leaked out of REM and into deep sleep) and my memories of the rave coming to an end would only come back to me later, immediately upon waking. (And even then it started to desaturate and clump the ""smoothness"" of events, causing me to forg-edit details)

And then I had the full revelation: ***I wasn't dreaming. **** I was actually a dead person, one who had lost their personal name as all who were are now have done. Yes, I did think that phrase and yes, it can make sense.

All the ravers were dead. Our long night was done and we were burying ourselves back into whatever grave felt most right. Some'day' somehow we'd be back up and raving again, and I would have my One Day of thinking I was some guy that was just alive and dreaming he was tom cruising instead of an anonymous spirit slurping his taste of excess lifesauce off my brain's nocturnal emissions.

Somehow this all made perfect sense.

The whole point of humanity is to spontaneously generate tasty art nuggets in our sleep. Dreaming and dying are obverse and reverse, life is the rare coin-on-its-edge.

Anyways:

I have a weird vivid memory of stubbering like a zombie in the crowd, closing in on Lakewood Cemetery, and someone somehow somewhere still humming.... *keeep me haaaangin' oooooon*

This was taking place in the present, ""sep 2, 2019"", I had some friends around me and we were talking, after a while everything gets pitch black and I start tumbling, as if I was in a drying machine, this happens for ~5 seconds and then I stop and something is breathing into my right ear, I freak out but I can't move, so I calm down. 3 seconds after that, boom. I wake up in the same class but this was in 2018. We were doing an assignment that I knew I've doe before, I was sitting at the front now, and I get up and I start telling the teacher that I've been here before, I came from the future, September 2nd 2019. Everyone was shocked, a girl came up and said she's experienced something similar, and then everything went black again and I see my teacher was talking to me, all I remember was the word ""iriguis"". And I start tumbling, same as before, and then the breathing... I relax again and boom, now I'm transported into some Harry Potter scene I can ever picture the music there would be playing, it was a dungeon, with golden flakes floating, spiraling in the center of the room, I was floating around the room, there was people in there with golden rods and chains, these people were dark, and then I wake up in real life. I had just experienced an insane dream, I guess I would only expect in some sensory deprivation tank high on shrooms.

838,"I was dreaming I crossed paths with a childhood crush, but in reality she's now a married woman with three children.",Dreams,"I was dreaming I was at a restaurant with my girlfriend because it was her birthday and I wanted to do something romantic for her.  It was ""Happy Hour"" and we sat at a table then ordered.

As we talked, my girlfriend and I began to feel a sense of unease when she pointed at another female looking at us.  

""Why is she looking at you like that?"" my lover said.

""I don't know.  I'll ask.""  I said back.

I approached the table where the other female was sitting at.  She was wearing a garden mask that covered the lower part of her face and immediately revealed herself.

She was a female who I had a crush on when we were in grade school and middle school together.  (Let's call her ""Jenny"" just to be clear)  She looked at me without saying anything but gestured at me to sit across from her.  She was wearing nothing more than a swimsuit that of course bared her abdomen and navel in a sexually suggestive manner.

I obliged.  We began engaging in conversation, but I insisted I needed to get back to where my girlfriend and I were sitting, but ""Jenny"" demanded I stay with her.  I did not oblige without saying anything.

After we left the restaurant, my girlfriend and I boarded a bus and we consoled each other.  She asked me who ""Jenny"" was and I explained.

""She was one of the popular girls and I was one of the fat kids who didn't fit in very well.  I was often bullied, but sometimes she broke character and told bullies to leave me alone.  Her charm easily convinced bullies that bullying was not worth it.  However the ironic part was that whenever she broke character, it pissed off other popular girls she hung out with.""

In reality, ""Jenny"" works in the dental field, got married just last year, and now has three children.  In fact, when she had her first sexual encounter at the age of 16, she unexpectedly got pregnant.  This of course shocked everyone.

839,I was dreaming I smoked cigarettes but in reality I avoid tobacco at all costs.,Dreams,"I was dreaming that I was at a party having a great time trying to enjoy myself and trying to be social with other people.  Another person approached me and asked me if I wanted to go outside and have a smoke.  I said yes and we did.  We began engaging in conversation and the desire to smoke more grew with great intensity and I snatched more cigarettes away from my new friend.  My new friend then offered me alcohol and obviously I got drunk in the process.

In reality, tobacco consumption in my family stopped with my mom and my sister both of whom have asthma.  I don't actually smoke because I think it's just gross.  Also, little opportunities to be social with people come my way in part because I am too busy with school and looking for work.

841,Live with my boyfriend (36m) of 4 years and our roommate (33m). I (31f) regularly dream about our roommate.,Dreams,"Just have to tell someone about this to get it out there. 

My boyfriend and I had met in 2013 and dated for a few months and broke up, nothing serious. Just different places in life. He encouraged me to remain friends with his friends group because we all really clicked. 

I did! Established my place in the group and everything is awesome. When friends found out we’d broken up a couple of the guys were interested in pursuing me. 

There was one I was attracted to - J. We hung out a few times (brunch and hanging out at his apartment, playing video games or watching shows) but he never made a move. Things sort of fizzled out before they really even got started. (He told one of the gals in our friends group that he didn’t want to corrupt me and he felt I was too sweet and innocent - she told me this a while after the fact out of the blue)

Boyfriend and I randomly rekindled things mid-late 2015 and moved in together first part of 2016. He had a roommate already, but he moved out summer/fall 2018 and we asked J to move in with us. He did and he’s an awesome roommate! 

But J is regularly in my dreams. Nothing X-rated, but my hand will brush his arm and sparks will fly or he’ll kiss me on the forehead and I’ll get butterflies in my stomach. I still think he’s a good looking dude, but isn’t someone I’d be interested in dating now that I know him better and am super happy in my relationship. 

But the dreams sometimes linger a bit and I still feel fondly for him when I run into him in the hallway, etc.

846,A strange dream,Dreams,"Hello, today I will tell you a completely strange dream that I had, a few minutes ago I woke up, in my dream I dreamed that I was in a movie or something, but although I knew it as I was inside it, in that world they were like islands huge floats and I seem to control a car, it was like a jeep very similar to that of gordon freeman in half life 2, for some reason something very strange happened ... my car exploded, at the moment that my car exploded I kind of came back to appear in front of the explosion ... with my car and everything and when I turn around I see my skeleton that transforms into a giant and screams after that it begins to persecute me, to pass from island to island there were like ramps that they had to jump in a car, in my world it seems that it was something like modern and at the same time medieval,  So when I came back, my grandmother was at home telling me a story ... children disappeared in the woods ... he told me about a boy who was in a shop and stole something, he was a chubby boy ... what I I remember, since I was fat in the past, that boy ran in the forest where, there were wolves with bright eyes that began to chase him, the boy at that moment begins to run ... to run like never before until he sees a covered area that was like a well to a vacuum, then the very scared jumps there, after that my grandmother tells me that she doesn't know what else happened to her, after that I start to be something very strange coming out the front of me home ... I see a lot of people running towards me, as I said before I was in a modern era, I was in a kind of giant city with walls, those people who came running to my house were  soldiers, then remember that in my world everyone was at war, and for some reason I had my giant skeleton-shaped giant self and that I could completely control it like in that movie of giant boxing robots, well the fact is that that giant I had a sword and I controlled it, so my whole family and the pubel asked me to protect them, defending them from so many soldiers, they didn't give up, since they came day by day, I think it had been 5 days, and on the third I see that giants made of trees begin to arrive but were alive, I continued fighting against them although some managed to enter and had soldiers burned some parts of the city but in my world there were firefighters who went and turned them off, long after I found with the king after surviving the 5 days and that king who was very old, very similar to my grandmother he tells me, that he had a crystal to give me, a crystal that I should take to the forest (I forgot to say that forest was on another island far away from the cities) that crystal, according to what I was going to wake up, asked him to wake up from what? He didn't answer me, he just sent me there, I realized  that my skeleton was no longer with me, so I went there in a car, when I got used to using a sword for a few days I was not complicated to defend myself from them until there were many at one time and being at night at that time I I noticed by his bright eyes almost of ghosts, when I ran from them I found a well with a vacuum and although I tried nothing more than to jump over it, being just above something emerged from my back and shot out, it was the same child who I counted in the town I had disappeared, when I saw it I was surprised because I had realized that it was my past self, my chubby self, then I hugged him and he asked me where I was, I said you will not know me but accompany me, the two together we ran more into the forest where we saw a large cave with lots of pillars and sculptures of giant skeletons,  when we walked inside we found something that really made me very sad ... he said that this world would be completely destroyed, if I laid the stone ... I began to tear through my eyes when I receive a call ... a call from my grandmother That told me not to look behind everything that happened in my dream, that this is a dream and that I can see it again in real life, but I could not ... I was too sad because I also shared a lot of things in my dream and although I knew it was a dream I could not destroy it and she told me that I had to do it to wake up, at that moment I cut myself, and my past self hugged me tightly and told me, ""You must do it"", I crying I told him that I was going to do it, when I laid the stone I said ""Love this world, thank you for letting me be someone very dear"" after putting it on and that the pillar where I should put it began to shine, everything starts to shake and my self told me ""We will miss you"". After that I woke up in my bed and although I had not cried I prepared to do it after waking up, I realized that I woke up at 4 in the afternoon, and I had slept last night at 12, this I write within minutes of waking up If you are still here I would also like to say that I love Berserk and the first manga that I bought, just the main character fought with a lot of skeletons, which perhaps had something to do with my dream, but that is the whole story.

849,I keep having dreams where I have Pica,Dreams,"Oh hey everyone first post here. I always liked the idea of sharing dreams with people. Here it goes...

&#x200B;

Well I keep having dreams where I have Pica. You know, the eating disorder where someone constantly snacks on inedible things like drywall or hair. I don't actually have Pica in real life and I don't think I can ever truly understand how it feels.

&#x200B;

The first dream this occurred, I couldn't stop eating smartphones. Like the entire dream played out like it normally would except I just had like this tray of smartphones that I kept grabbing from and snacking on them like cookies.  I just remember loving the crunch of the broken glass flying everywhere and thinking battery fluidy insides were delicious. Eventually after eating like a dozen of them I got a really bad stomach ache and became really dizzy, probably from internal bleeding. I fell over unconscious and woke up in the real world.

&#x200B;

I know I've had several of these the past couple weeks, I just don't really remember what I was eating in them. This is probably why I should form a habit of writing in a dream journal. I think the last one I had I kept eating newspapers. 

&#x200B;

My dreams are almost always weird as fuck but also very beautiful. Weird shit happening is a common occurrence, and neither me or any of the denizens of my dreams usually bat an eye of these things, but they do actually see my eating habits as a little bit strange for some reason. Usually they'll stop mid conversation and be like ""Um why are you eating that?"" and I'll tell them its because it tastes delicious and they'll usually be like ""Uh alright then...."" and carry on talking or whatever they were doing, allowing me to continue consuming my delicious weird shit.

850,Repetitive dreams of abusive ex?,Dreams,"For the last few months now, I keep having dreams of my ex fiancé, who was very abusive towards me, emotionally and physically. 

In the dreams, I’ll be there, as will my current and ex fiancé. I will end up telling my current fiancé that I don’t love her (which isn’t true at all, I love her with all of my heart), or end up going with my ex fiancé who ends up abusing me in the dream or just all together disappearing.

851,Recurring meta-nightmare of not being able to wake up,Dreams,"I will start this by saying that my psychiatrist has said that I sleep far too much.  Where a normal person sleeps 6-8 hours a night, 8 hours is my minimum and even if I have slept eight hours during the night, I can still nap during the day for anywhere from 30 minutes to 2 hours, and occasionally I sleep the whole day away (that last bit is usually because of depression, as I have manic depression).

So, this is a nightmare that has occurred once a month, and I first started having this nightmare in senior year of high school, and I am now 24 y.o. and graduated undergrad in 2017.

The reason I say ""meta-nightmare"" is because the actual dream that occurs is different every time, as in the events, but the theme is always the same.

In these nightmares, I am always struggling to wake up.  I desperately want to awaken but my body keeps falling back into sleep, and I fight a losing war to wake up (in the dream). I had one just today that went like this:

I was taking a nap on my bed, and my mom comes home. I wrestle myself out of my bed to talk to her, but I keep falling back asleep. I even turned on my laptop just to mess around in Skyrim, but I kept falling back asleep. I sort of limp towards my mom in the living room and ask her to help me. She sits me down next to the security television, and then gives me her chai (Indian milk tea that has a lot of caffeine). I try to drink it, I try to pour it down my throat, but I can't. It's just impossible to drink the coffee and wake up. I beg my mom, screaming for her to help me, and she says she can't and she gives up. I start panicking as I feel sleep trying to overcome me again, and this time I succumb for good.  It is then that I wake up in the real world with heavy breathing, panting, and panic.

For added context:

1) I have had problems with my sleep cycle since sophomore year of high school. I would often sleep at least a little bit in every class except for my very last two of the day, and sometimes those too. But, I never went to the doctor about this, because I am pretty god dang smart and I was able to get really high grades (90+) in virtually all of my classes, and I got high AP test scores too (5/5 in AP Calculus AB, despite the fact that I slept in that class almost every single day), I still had a decent social life (as much as my uber-strict Indian parents would allow, that is), I still saw therapy.

2) I am a tabletop game designer, aspiring author working on a high fantasy novel, and aspiring videogame designer/entrepreneur. A lot of my inspiration for things in my games and books come from the dreams I have that I easily remember when I wake up. Several of my tabletop game's campaigns are based on dreams I had. Themes in my books are based off of dreams.  The sort of cultural theme/fit of my novel worlds are based on dreams. Hell, the idea for my novels' stories were from daydreaming/ as a creative outlet while being bullied in middle school/high school, but what helped me really shape them as unique, breathing worlds were the myriad of dreams I would have that I would remember.

3) I also have bipolar disorder (manic depression) as I have mentioned.

4) I do have some symptoms of PTSD according to my current therapist.

5) I am overweight, with asthma and allergies (currently I am in my allergy season, and my sinuses are always at least somewhat stuffed).

I am not sure, how much the last one has to do with this, but I think it might have something.

852,"The higher beings were having a game show of some sort, and humanity destroyed itself.",Dreams,"I started in some weird butcher's kitchen. I felt like I'd been trying to escape, everyone else around me had been dying in gruesome ways. I felt like I was part of a game show where living was the goal, only I eventually found out living was never an option in the end.

After avoiding death a few times, I wound up outside. I was surviving with a girl I'd just met, we were both scared shitless. She then was abducted and thrown into a vehicle which drove off. I called 911, but the operator seemed distracted, and eventually the call just ended out of the blue.

It was then that someone started coming at me with a pipe. I killed him with that pipe after maneuvering around his swinging. After killing a few more people, the sky clicked for a moment, like all time had briefly paused. Every electronic around me with a screen then began broadcasting something, but I turned away. When I refused to watch, every phone everywhere began ringing maniacally, then they all went to speaker mode and said simultaneously, ""WE HAVE OUR WINNER. PLEASE GIVE A WARM ROUND OF APPLAUSE FOR *crackle* *I don't want to play this anymore...**crackle*""

It was my mother's voice. She sounded so incredibly tired.

After that, everyone, including me, completely changed moods. We were all smiling, greeting each other, laughing, hugging, talking about how grand life has been. After our brief moment of happiness, we began killing each other again, only it was now voluntarily and done with a smile on our faces, like we had all accomplished something great together by making it to the end.

Last night I had a dream that I was in this house with my mom (my mom and I don't have the greatest of relationships) and we were checking the place out because we had just moved in. It was a weird tree house kind of thing with water completely surrounding it.
Not sure how I got to this part of my dream but there was a part where I was in a bath with my mom, and there were two babies in the bath with us, I'm pretty sure they were twins. I mentioned something to my mom about the babies, she had a look of shock on her face and then she started frantically looking around in the tub. There was one baby in front of me so I pulled it out from underwater and there was another baby to my side that I had to do the same with. Both babies were starting to go blue and couldn't breathe because they were drowning... Woke up feeling a little icky.
Could anyone help me interpret this dream? Maybe it's just crazy hormones?",0,twin almost drowning bathtub really weird dream lately week ago dream took pregnancy test positive last week took test know positive extreme morning sickness joking saying maybe twin harder body make morning sickness intense last night dream house mom mom greatest relationship checking place moved weird tree house kind thing water completely surrounding sure got part dream part bath mom two baby bath u pretty sure twin mentioned something mom baby look shock face started frantically looking around tub one baby front pulled underwater another baby side baby starting go blue breathe drowning woke feeling little icky could anyone help interpret dream maybe crazy hormone
854,"End of the world dream by hurricanes, earthquakes and fire",Dreams,"I just woke up less than 5 minutes ago and maybe some could explain why I had this dream. Sorry if this is long. 

It honestly is one of the most vivid dream I’ve had in years. It felt so realistic. 

Basically, I live in Bermuda, where experiencing a hurricane (during the season) is normal. I was at my grandmas house with most of my intermediate family (like 10 of us), riding out the storm. It wasn’t the “worst of it” yet, as it still had time to get to its closest point. We were all in the living room just watching the news, chilling etc. It was just really rainy and windy. 

As time went on, the weather was deteriorating. Still we were okay because it was something we know how to handle. Videos then started to be sent to our phones of people’s houses being destroyed by tornadoes. I remember my brother showing me one of the videos and then the house started shake violently. (Context: Although I’ve experienced a good deal of hurricanes, I’ve never experienced a earthquake before). It probably lasted about a minute. But it was the worst thing to experience since it was also a hurricane outside! 

Everyone was okay, just a few things knocked off the edge. We tried looking outside (dont know why), but we could barely see anything since there was a lot of salt spray from the ocean on the windows (a normal thing). 

Now for the weird, fucked up part (that I can’t unsee). We could see a figure walking towards our front door. The person knocks, a few times. We want to stay quiet because we were all scared. He speaks just to say “ya’ll stay safe now”. And then we see him walk away. Let me remind you, there’s a full hurricane outside, wind, rain, tornadoes etc. 

Everyone goes back to the living room, talking about the earthquake happening. I was looking at Instagram, watching a friend’s story about her reaction to the earthquake, when suddenly there was a orange light, then a huge “explosion” (in the sense of the house shaking again, and the loud noise). 

All the lights and our phones went completely dark. I honestly thought I had died. But when we checked to see if everyone was ok, we checked outside the window. The sky was completely blue. The sun was shining bright, looked a lot closer than normal. Hurricane was gone. But now there was fire. Everything was on fire. It felt like I entered hell with all of my family. My grandma started praying, and when she finished, my stepdad said “have fun”. 

I jolted awake. Its early in the morning, and yet I feel rested and don’t feel the need to fall asleep again.  Usually I’d go back to sleep but, I don’t really need to.",0,end world dream hurricane earthquake fire woke le minute ago maybe could explain dream sorry long honestly one vivid dream year felt realistic basically live bermuda experiencing hurricane season normal grandma house intermediate family like u riding storm worst yet still time get closest point living room watching news chilling etc really rainy windy time went weather deteriorating still okay something know handle video started sent phone people house destroyed tornado remember brother showing one video house started shake violently context although experienced good deal hurricane never experienced earthquake probably lasted minute worst thing experience since also hurricane outside everyone okay thing knocked edge tried looking outside dont know could barely see anything since lot salt spray ocean window normal thing weird fucked part unsee could see figure walking towards front door person knock time want stay quiet scared speaks say ya stay safe see walk away let remind full hurricane outside wind rain tornado etc everyone go back living room talking earthquake happening looking instagram watching friend story reaction earthquake suddenly orange light huge explosion sense house shaking loud noise light phone went completely dark honestly thought died checked see everyone ok checked outside window sky completely blue sun shining bright looked lot closer normal hurricane gone fire everything fire felt like entered hell family grandma started praying finished stepdad said fun jolted awake early morning yet feel rested feel need fall asleep usually go back sleep really need

I had the strangest vision in my sleep last night. It began by my neighbour knocking on my window, I opened and we started to talk and then suddenly I saw a huge wolf like dog sailing down from the sky towards us followed by some alien humanoid riding some kind of cart, they made me feel like they are way more evolved than me and that they could end me in a single moment if they wanted but they didn't come because of that.
I kept saying to her ""can you see that, this is impossible but it is way too real to be a dream!"" And when they reached us I woke up, it was still dark, I felt so weird.

858,A creepy dream I had,Dreams,"So I went to bed last night thinking “oh Life is so great and all” little did I know I was about to have the most creepiest dream I have ever had.(not counting the time I had sleep paralysis) so at first it’s dark, but then I’m running and panicking in a dark forest with people (who I think were supposed to be friends?) running with me from something. The forest was very woodsy but not much else to see except for darkness. We keep running until we get to this open spot with a trap door type thing on the floor. One of them opens it and there’s a basement room kinda thing???? With broken glass and bones all scattered on the floor but there isn’t much else to see because of how dark it was. There was a small wooden table in the center of the room though. One by one, they all jumped into the room but for some reason I kept thinking in my mind,(it’s a trap she’s trying to trap us) but at the same time I didn’t know who “she” was??? So I was very reluctant to jump in but I finally did after I saw someone in the woods. After I jumped in, I blacked out. I then wake up again in a small wooden cabin during the day. When I say it’s small, it’s SMALL. Like a single room with little walking space. The room seems very grey and with no color. When I looked around all I saw were sigils. All scratched on the floor and walls.  There was a small staircase that led to a wooden door. Across from the door was a rocking chair facing the corner of the room and a black figure with very long hair that draped over the back of the rocking chair. As soon as I saw her, I ran as fast I could toward the door and I got out into the woods. It was the same woods, but during the day. I turned around and the house was gone. No where to be seen. I then blacked out again. I wake up again but this time I’m in a black room with nothing but a woman’s face breathing distance away. She looked normal but her whole face was distorted. Her left eye was on her forehead and her right was on her cheek. Her mouth was near her left ear and her nose was curving toward the right side. Her eyes were also glazed over. She just stared at me for a good few minutes until I hear whispers. I heard what sounded like at least thirty people whisper to me at once “Feed them bones” in my ear. It was so loud even now I think it was real. After that my vision started to fade again. I woke up in a car this time in the back seat with two unknown people in the front driving. They are talking but I don’t remember what about. Their trunk was packed to the brim and you couldn’t see out the back window. They kept driving down this empty back road until we get to this small parking lot in the middle of no where. They start rushing like it’s the end of the world and grab stuff from the trunk and take it into the woods. I don’t know why but I do the same as them and I grab as much of the junk as I can and run into the woods. As I soon as I pass the tree line I loose them. For some reason I just kept calling out their names but they were no where to be seen. And once again I fade out. Finally, I’m phased into me baking but I’m very stressed and panicked. I’m baking bread but I feel like if I don’t do it right I will die. I’m baking it normally but then I take a bowl of crushed up bone shards and put them in with the dough. Once the bread is done I feel very relieved and I start to cut the bread up and serve it to random people on the street. As I’m doing this I hear the same whispers again. After I hear the whispers I wake up VERY scared and sweaty. I still heard the whispers for a few seconds after I woke up. Weird thing is I woke up at 3:00 AM. After that I stayed up till about 6:30 or 7. I was basically waiting for the sun to come up.",0,creepy dream went bed last night thinking oh life great little know creepiest dream ever counting time sleep paralysis first dark running panicking dark forest people think supposed friend running something forest woodsy much else see except darkness keep running get open spot trap door type thing floor one open basement room kinda thing broken glass bone scattered floor much else see dark small wooden table center room though one one jumped room reason kept thinking mind trap trying trap u time know reluctant jump finally saw someone wood jumped blacked wake small wooden cabin day say small small like single room little walking space room seems grey color looked around saw sigils scratched floor wall small staircase led wooden door across door rocking chair facing corner room black figure long hair draped back rocking chair soon saw ran fast could toward door got wood wood day turned around house gone seen blacked wake time black room nothing woman face breathing distance away looked normal whole face distorted left eye forehead right cheek mouth near left ear nose curving toward right side eye also glazed stared good minute hear whisper heard sounded like least thirty people whisper feed bone ear loud even think real vision started fade woke car time back seat two unknown people front driving talking remember trunk packed brim see back window kept driving empty back road get small parking lot middle start rushing like end world grab stuff trunk take wood know grab much junk run wood soon pas tree line loose reason kept calling name seen fade finally phased baking stressed panicked baking bread feel like right die baking normally take bowl crushed bone shard put dough bread done feel relieved start cut bread serve random people street hear whisper hear whisper wake scared sweaty still heard whisper second woke weird thing woke stayed till basically waiting sun come

861,Weirdest lucid dream experience?,Dreams,"My only truly weird experience is this:

Now, I should note that in my experience, stating ""this is a dream"" or similar out loud causes lucid dreams to become unstable, and those were the first words out of my mouth in this dream.

Anyway, moving on. I became lucid by noticing a plot hole (some characters were both real and fictional), and then went onto the boardwalk to have fun, all excited that this was the most vivid I ever felt in a dream... But the dream became unstable before I could even do anything.

Like, my previously normal consciousness became hazy again (as in the phenomenon that makes dreams feel like a distant memory rather than something that really happened) and I instantly realized my mistake.

Suddenly, I was literally dragged into the air. I quickly grabbed onto the boardwalk railing to keep myself grounded. I repeated ""concentrate"" to myself, as this was a mental battle as well as a physical one.

I was eventually dragged into a black void anyway, as if I hadn't been holding on to the railing. I was in a sort of limbo state, floating to nowhere, but I knew I was floating up. I still tried to fight to keep myself asleep, but that didn't work. I became aware of my surroundings, and I woke up.

I still think about this from time to time. It was not a normal lucid dream, as I usually wake up on the spot. Like, I know exactly why my dream became unstable, but what was with that whole mental battle I lost, and what was with me literally being dragged up through a black void before waking up?

Also, what was your weirdest lucid dream experience?",0,weirdest lucid dream experience truly weird experience note experience stating dream similar loud cause lucid dream become unstable first word mouth dream anyway moving became lucid noticing plot hole character real fictional went onto boardwalk fun excited vivid ever felt dream dream became unstable could even anything like previously normal consciousness became hazy phenomenon make dream feel like distant memory rather something really happened instantly realized mistake suddenly literally dragged air quickly grabbed onto boardwalk railing keep grounded repeated concentrate mental battle well physical one eventually dragged black void anyway holding railing sort limbo state floating nowhere knew floating still tried fight keep asleep work became aware surroundings woke still think time time normal lucid dream usually wake spot like know exactly dream became unstable whole mental battle lost literally dragged black void waking also weirdest lucid dream experience
862,"Coughing up my heart, swallowing it again.",Dreams,"It's not unusual for me to have wild dreams. But last nights were more intense than I've experienced for a couple months. For context IRL I'm happily married.
This will also be in sections as I woke up and than fell back to sleep. 

First I'm standing in the center of a wasteland village it's dark. I haven't seen anyone else but I sense danger. I try to navigate my way to safety but I feel my body growing weak and realize the dream is holding me back. I use lucidity to will myself forward focusing on a hut nearby with a lantern lit out front. I am able to enter the hut. 

Suddenly I'm in daylight, around me are thousands of people, colorful lights, and sounds. I'm with people I don't know, we are eating fried chicken while walking. This part is hard to remember and very brief.

That ends and I'm back in that wasteland, I go to a home there that I know to be mine. The home is small and has little curb appeal but there is still a sense of whimsy. I go to bed with my spouse.  After sleeping for a couple hours we are awoken, someone has broken in. We move to the bathroom and my spouse refuses to hide, I use my lucidity to hide behind the shower curtain and when the intruder enters and tries to attack my lover I strike first from stealth. He is taken prisoner.

Next I've moved the intruder into our kitchen. The dream house is now luxurious,  high end finishes, it's bigger on the inside than I saw  walking up, we have butlers and anything our hearts desire... I realize I know his energy he's a scorned lover from my past someone I dated for less than a year. I have a soft spot for him I try to talk him down from his anger towards me and my spouse. I start to cook him a steak, everything is starting to calm down. Than I hear sirens. I can't finish cooking the steak, so I send him away with it in a plastic bag. I am upset he tried to hurt us but I feel like he is no threat. I escort him through a marble hallway and past our security gate. I see him walk away but I get a sinister feeling he isn't done yet. The doors have a stupid locking system that you must time perfectly with a pinhole key as they slide open and closed. I have to do this twice on two doors to fully lock the security. I fail on the last keyhole and am knocked out from behind. 

I wake up IRL adrenaline pumping through me, very visually disoriented, and frozen. I have been through this before so I collect myself. I wake my spouse and ask him to check the house, everything is alright and we go back to sleep. 

Now I'm at a picnic table with some friends, my chest starts to hurt. For some reason instead of just asking for help or seeking medicine I cough harder, HARDER until I dislodge my heart and hold it in my hands. My heart is small but it looks healthy and vibrant. I feel no pain or panic. I even show some of the friends around me the heart I'm holding in my hands. Some I know wouldn't believe without proof. 

Than I swallow it back down, it's so large I nearly choke but   I manage.... Somehow.

It's later in the evening and we've all had good drink and food we are laughing and conversing and there are now several rows of friends and family. Suddenly I feel a tap on the shoulder. I know instantly that this is the first man I loved. Whom I had spent 4 years with returned from the military. I turn to face him and he has tears in his eyes, he feels regret about the messy breakup we had and he wishes I had waited for him to make up his mind. 

( I had broken his heart by being unfaithful during a mental health crisis I deeply regret, and had no meaning to me. I've since learned to control with medication and therapy .)

 I embrace him and tell him I've been waiting a long time to know he wanted me too. Than we leave everything behind, together.

I can’t see their face or anything, they’re almost two dimensional. Extremely skinny and very tall. And in the dream last night there was a rainbow stone light flashing behind them. They watch/stalk by looking through front doors.
For the rest of the dream I’m essentially just spending the rest of the day being mindful of if they’re around or not and hiding.

I saw a white light, the explosion... it looked like it was far away. But I was still standing around. I remember standing on a small board ramp, just... frozen and staring at the explosion. I remember my mother (she had dark skin and black hair, IRL I'm white) running up to me and trying to shake me, but I just kept staring at the explosion.

It was like I was invisible to her, and all I could feel was this growing heat on my skin. It just kept getting hotter and hotter, and I remember thinking about a shockwave (if it ever hit) and everything just went black. I wasn't really panicking, I was just... distant. Staring blankly at the explosion as my mom tried shaking me or getting my attention, and it was like I wasn't even there.

I personally don't consider it a nightmare.

And when we get to the big event It’s a speed course, if we do something wrong we will be poisoned or something. I, for some reason, have been through this before. I get through the first couple of problems but keep messing up and have to start over. Soon this person my age catches up to me and is hell-bent on finishing this thing before me so she can get out first. I am freaking out but I have been through this before. It starts out as a test of speed for both of us who can finish all of the things first. Then I realize that I’m not fast enough and I’ll have to outwit them. So I try to get to the obstacle that has the person douse their nails in poison (I don’t remember why) thinking I can just scratch her and paralyzed her than speed through the course. But because they for some reason are invincible or immune to poison it doesn’t work. So I pretend to scratch myself and become paralyzed. They see that I’m “paralyzed” and attempt to drown me in some kind of magic pond. But once they tough the pond they lose their invincibility. I pretend that I died and they walk back to the course to finish it. But I sneak up behind them and scratch them with my poison covered nails and I guess I was so aggressive that instead of paralyzing them it slowly kills them. But the only reason that I knew this was because while I was struggling through a puzzle they died. Anyways the other person that entered this went insane shortly into this shit show. When this person dies The Man comes out and informed me that I have won but to leave (the insane person has brought back a car and he turns out to be my adopted sibling) I have to leave my sibling here. I don’t know if my sibling goes through this hell loop again or is they die here but I for some reason feel like leaving them there is the right choice. I know if I leave them there The Man will cure his insanity and my sibling will manage to get out. I then start the drive back to my new parent’s house before I wake up and have to write this at 6:30 am.

874,Falconeering with a crippled Greg Davis,Dreams,"This dream I had last night started out with me being in Wales. I don't know exactly where. I was in a bathroom with two other guys waiting to use a stall, when Greg Davis comes out of one of the occupied stalls in a wheelchair. I'm a short guy but I could actually look him dead in the eyes without straining my neck to gaze upwards at his towering behemoth of a body. Anyway, I proceeded into the next stall and went about my business.

When I came out of the bathroom, I met my partner and was about to continue our walk we had been on, when I spot Greg Davis off to the side, looking at me with that confused look he has. There's a bird on the arm of his wheelchair, maybe a Harris Hawk or something, I'm not good with bird types. I didn't ask permission before putting my arm out and waiting for it to land on my arm, which it did, and then I proceeded to fly the bird several times, which left massive gashes in my arm caused by its talons.

After a while the dream skipped ahead to the injuries on my arm being treated.

877,I keep dying in my dreams,Dreams,"I’ve had two dreams this week now where I was dying or I died. The one I had last night was extremely weird and unsettling. 

I was laying down and I felt my jaw clench really tight and then I started having seizures and falling in and out of consciousness in the dream. I got on the ground and crawled to my parents room and opened their door and told my mother “I think I’m dying”. She kinda shrugged it off and I continued to seize in and out of consciousness while my jaw was clenched super hard. I like half woke up and my jaw hurt and was also clenched in reality and then I just turned to my other side and I was fine.

 It was really weird and unsettling because I couldn’t distinguish the dream from reality because in the dream I was in the same place, position, setting, etc. as I was when I fell asleep. I don’t have a history of seizures, I had one when I was a baby but that’s it. I’ve been under a  lot of stress lately and my mental state is shooting downward so that could have something to do with it?

There was a shelf with many used books and she didn’t find any shoes because she was distracted looking through the books, laying in a sofa right next to the shelf. 

This kind of freaks me out a little. Never experienced anything like this before. And no, she didn’t tell me she was looking for shoes or anything yesterday, I’m one hundred percent sure.

883,Had an awkward dream and have nobody to talk about it with...,Dreams,"Throwaway because friends know my Reddit account. 

You know those dreams that when you wake up you are super confused because you had no idea you were dreaming. I felt like I had complete control of my actions but didn't know I was dreaming, like a semi lucid dream.

I am sure this sub has a lot of ""I dreamed about my friend and now I have a crush on them post"" but I promise this post isn't like that, and I do not have a crush on my friend. 

So last night in my dream I got a text from my friend and she said she would like to go out on a date (Let's call her Ella for the purpose of this post). In real life me and Ella are friends, we have known eachother for the better part of a decade and are pretty close, but she goes to school abroad and we don't see each other often, we also have a lot of mutual friends and whatnot, it has never been an intimate situation and I have never had feelings for Ella, true honest to god friends. (If your one of the dudes that don't believe guys and girls can't ""just"" be friends you can pop out now, your useless to me) 

In the dream it was very intimate, we were kissing and touching, but it wasn't a sex dream, it was romantic and friendly and weird, something I have never dreamed about before. Before last night I didn't think about going into a relationship at all, I felt like I was not mature enough or stable enough for a long term relationship and I didn't really enjoy casual dating, I am pretty wrapped up in my internship. 

Overnight due to this dream an entire dynamic in my life has changed, I have never had anything like this happen to me, especially because of a dream! Now I am very interested in getting into a relationship, thinking about feels alot different than it did just 24 hours ago. Before if you asked me I would have said ""I am not really into that part of my life yet"", now I am thinking about it completely differently. Its like a switch has flipped. 

I certainly have no interest in getting into a relationship with Ella, in the same way you don't have any interest in dating your cousin, did I have this dream just because I miss my friend?

I have had relationships in the past, but those I knew for a fact we're going to end someday, high school girl friends and girls I met living abroad, short term things. I have never had interest in having a long term relationship until last night, how do I even start going about that? I am dreading being in a discord call with my friend because it will be so awkward, who else had similar experiences? Obviously I am very frazzled and would appreciate some advice and insight on this!

885,I had my first nightmare in 4 years and,Dreams,"I watch a lot of horror content so I think it’s finally catching up to me. It was like some kind of tv channel anomaly. I wrote down a bunch of weird shit on notepad when I was half asleep and able to kind of remember it. Here’s the weird stuff I wrote in not any particular order:

Have to watch in a certain way

Eyebrows on crotch actually eyes? 

You actually passed out 

Creature controlling your dream almost similar to long neck dinosaur but small enough to fit in a house and has the face of a burnt man with sharp teeth

If you do any step wrong it’s already too late

Eyebrows

The creature kisses your head all over until you mess up and then gets more and more affectionate until it rips off your head and eats it while sobbing

Some outcomes take longer until you die

Very few can actually be escaped

One is a society where shaking your head rapidly is illegal, doing this will let you break free an wake up. But this society does everything it can to stop it. Get caught and it rips off your head

Pier??

No longer living at home we moved

Back to old town but smaller house next apartments 

There’s now a pier?

At this pier inside some kind of building is when it got me

1 channel is deafeningly loud

Each outcome involves you waking up and going outside, it’s at sunset. You go through the rest of the night like nothing happened until you find a major disturbing unnatural difference in this fake world at which it kills you

It likes to say “oh sweet (name)”

5? 7 channels?

887,The Silhouette Man / One of the worst nightmares I've ever had,Dreams,"
It started at my friends house, but it wasn't their house in real life, it was some sort of duplex or apartment and they lived at the top portion. Right in the beginning of the dream, I am leaving to go to my car and they walk me to the door. I walked down the stairs and towards my car. It was late at night and I had a random car I was driving. I got in and I was looking for my phone or keys or something, but I couldn't see very well. It was pitch black in the car and also outside.

I turned to look behind me for some reason, and I saw the silhouette of a figure sitting behind the passenger seat. I kind of just stared at it for a few minutes and I thought it was all just in my head. As I was about to turn back around, the silhouette spoke - ""alright alright I'll step out for now.""

I was petrified, but this guy just opens the door and steps out of my car. I immediately lock the doors and take off. I think I drove for a while before getting home. I then remember being inside of a house that was not mine in real life, but in my dream world I was home. I was also alone. I went straight to bed and after laying down for only a minute, the silhouette guy walks in and starts saying creepy things. I do not remember what exactly, but he spoke in a very deep voice. Almost whispering. 

He then proceeded to get in bed with me and before I could run he grabbed me. He held me down in the bed and I was trying to scream but no one could hear me (I couldn't even hear myself) and then he just started touching me in weird places but he didn't rape me. He just rubbed me in places like my thighs, shoulders and stomach. I remember he took off some of my clothes, and every once in a while I was able to release his grip and try and get up but then he kept pulling me back and holding my mouth shut.

I was able to escape at one point and I managed to get to a friends house and I slept in bed with her. My friend was asleep but I kept seeing the silhouette man in the shadows. 

In the dream time about an hour passed. I looked over to the door, and he walked into the room from the hallway. He crawled into bed right on top of me and I was screaming for my friend but they were dead. No matter how much the bed shook and no matter how loud I screamed she would not move. The silhouette man didn't seem threatened by my friend so I think he might have killed them in the night.

He did not hold me down for long before I was able to escape. He had taken my shirt off and I remember not caring and running away from the house and screaming for help. 

I approached a house, and as I was about to pound on the door, I already knew there was nobody home. He was behind me the whole time.

888,First time I die in a dream,Dreams,"It wasn't a very interesting one. For what I can recall, it was like a gang shot up on a restaurant.
I was one of the shooters, when a leader came and suddenly my weapon felt powerless against him, it didn't do any harm.
He had a bigger one, and started shooting at me. I fell to the ground and tried to play dead when he started to shoot at my legs, so I realised it wasn't working. Then he aimed at my head, and I closed my eyes.
A first bullet went right into my head, but for some reason I was still alive, and then I hear a second gunshot and everything muted and went pitch black, even more than before.

889,Vivid Dreams and Mental Health,Dreams,"Heads up that this is going to be a REALLY long post. I'll also say beforehand that these dreams are pretty weird and typing the last one out for the second time makes me realize that it reads like a child's fanfiction. I'm also going to go into excruciating detail in some of this, so be ready to pay attention. TL;DR I'm having vivid nightmares and I think I'm developing schizophrenia or a similar mental illness due to the detail of my dreams.

I don't use reddit a whole lot but I think I might be able to get some information about what I've been experiencing here over Google, since this is a directly related page for it. Either way I think it'll be interesting to hear discussion.

I have been having strange, vivid dreams during naps before work and after school that have never failed to entertain me when I wake up, but lately I've questioned if this is an issue with my mental health. I've been living with depression for around a year or so, and am extremely pessimistic and isolated whenever I feel the need to be. I'm no shut-in, but lately I've had an urge to be alone/enjoy being alone for long periods of time and tend to get upset when I make plans with friends one on one and more come, although not upset at my friends and rather just an uncomfortable feeling in my gut. I'm also a very paranoid person; walking alone in my relatively small suburban house at night scares the living shit out of me. Typing this right now with my back to my door is also mildly concerning, but luckily I've found that noise (usually music) manages to keep me calm. I guess it'd be more correct to say I'm afraid of silence and the dark?

I've had a trend lately of coming home from school exhausted because of my inability to get myself in bed. I'm typing this at 1 AM on a school night instead of sleeping right now. My work hours are usually between 16-25 a week, with varying shifts every week. This week in particular I worked 17, a 5 hour shift Sunday and 4 hour shifts Monday-Wednesday. I'll come home, grab some food, put on YouTube, and then after a little bit I'll put on some Adult Swim bumps or Pink Floyd to put myself to sleep so I can catch up on missed sleep from the night before. Then I'd sink into a moderate to deep sleep with a dream I could remember the entirety of.

At first these dreams were actually nightmares, but my nightmares don't revolve around my natural fears, rather of unknown people. I tend to watch horror media a lot so cryptids or urban legends don't scare me much. However, the fact I even had nightmares or dreams at all was staggering because up until about 2 weeks ago I haven't had a dream I remembered since I was 12, and I'm 18 now.

This is especially weird to me since it's only happening in bursts and with *vivid* detail. I can recall almost every small detail from these nightmares or dreams.

The first two nightmares I had were pretty straight to the point but with an odd similarity.

[First part of the first nightmare](https://i.redd.it/512km9a4i9q31.png)

[Second part of the first nightmare](https://i.redd.it/gn91i8e5i9q31.png)

[Second and much more concerning nightmare](https://i.redd.it/glysyov8i9q31.png)

Both of these dreams took place in places I grew up in and reminisce about daily. I want to go back to both of these and I actually have an open invite to go back to my elementary school to talk to the teacher mentioned in the post. I don't really know the significance of that but it was concerning at first.

Then today I had a normal dream. Not scary, but it was concerning in its own merit. I remember literally every single minor detail for the first \~2 hours of the dream from height of other characters to their slight mannerisms. Before I talk about this one, I'll come out the gate saying yes, I'm a furry. I hope that this fact doesn't cloud your judgement of the seriousness of this post or myself as I'd like to genuinely discuss this with people.

I'll explain the first half of my dream. It starts with me and a friend of mine getting into a car crash but luckily we only sustained minor injuries and were out within the week. This was the only part of the dream with a time skip in it. We were discharged from the hospital on the day of a new kind of convention that seemed directly up my alley; basically Comic-Con with rock/metal concerts. After the last performance by what I remember to be Rob Scallon the friend I had went with suggested we split paths and look around a little. I agreed, and off I went.

One of the booths I went to was a box poll for ""Best Performance of the Night"" or something like that. I talked to the guy running it for maybe 25 seconds and then he asked if I would run the booth for a moment while he gets a drink since, in all honesty, it was braindead work. I agreed on the account I get to take one of the shirts he was selling for the event and we had a deal. He leaves, and an hour passes. I'm bored out of my mind at 11:30 according to my watch, and at this point I assume that my friend (and the guy) have left. I finally look at the surrounding booths.

To my right there's a pink carnival tent, but with no front opening. The inside was only visible from where the booth was entered, although it seemed to have an off-room or something. And what I saw inside was a LOT of attractive women in cosplays of video game or anime characters. At first I looked away because I didn't want to be rude until one of them made eye contact with me and purposefully waved her ass at me. At that point I had just kinda sat there waving back (with my hand) and they left and went to a different tent that, from what I could see, was attractive men in cosplays as well. I could only assume what happened then. Then I heard a whistle from my left.

I looked over and all I saw was a giant yellow, red and blue building. It looked like a child's castle made out of LEGOs. It was, architecturally, a mess. However what caught me off guard the most was that there was an opening in the roof which showed a bedroom. Leaning down from the bedroom and looking at me were 5 furry women. I quickly figured out which one whistled to me since she leaned out the furthest and had her hand in the air. She had blue hair and blue fur and white fur in the middle. The easiest way to describe it is Krystal from Starfox except she had a crop top and underwear on. She waved towards me and then lifted her shirt. I don't really know what drove my conscious to push me in the direction of a very obvious trap (in a literal sense not a dude in girl's clothing) but I went into that dumbass looking building ready to get some action. Or so I thought.

I walk into this building and the walls are grey, dark, and covered in pipes and concrete. Then as I'm walking I notice that the interior is not only MUCH bigger on the inside than it is on the outside, but it's also a fucking labyrinth. The way the walls and floors were laid out reminded me of this M.C. Escher art:

https://i.redd.it/j3sy4vfxm9q31.png

As I continue up the stairs I notice that the areas are getting less compact and labyrinthine and luckily I make it to a four way intersection of concrete floor directly above the sprawling maze I just wandered through. There's railing on every side and it's in the shape of a plus. There's also a giant window behind me the size of the wall, and the sky and moon were so clear it looked like I could touch them. I walked north and found a large staircase that lead up to a red brick building. On these stairs there were furries of all shapes and sizes sitting on them doing whatever and they all looked at me confused as I passed by. I walk through the door of the strange building-within-a-building and am greeted to a GIANT lobby full of chairs, almost arranged like an auditorium. Everyone in the room falls silent except for one grey furred, black haired cat with glasses and a small stature and slim build.

This cat spoke in a very nervous and sort of shaky tone to me. He told me his name was Phil and that I was essentially in an inter-dimensional elevator. He also explained how upon entry to this building we all have HUDs like in a VR game or really any shooting game. He asked why I was there, and, in a very coy and embarrassed way, told him the details. He laughed and said ""Seduced into a place like this? That's really shitty. I asked if there was any way I could get directions to the bedroom. He then led me to a hallway filled with computers and trolls from Homestuck. (I haven't read Homestuck since 2015 and I never even finished it, so this was incredibly weird to me.)

The troll said he could locate the girl if I told her what she looked like. So I did, and he closed his eyes and a blue, digital halo appeared around his head. Five seconds later he opened his eyes and said ""Marinda; Blue and Indigo Fox, Female; Level 8."" (I remember how her name was pronounced too, it was Mare-in-duh, not Muh-rin-duh.) I asked about the Levels he had mentioned and he told me the whole inter-dimensional elevator thing again but with a few more details. We were on Level 0, or the entry point. Level 1 was a desert with a cyberpunk city in it. Level 2 was a small city with a fantastically huge junkyard. After that, he doesn't know the other ones, but Level 8 is supposedly ""Heaven,"" and ""if that fox girl waved you up to Heaven I'm sure there's something about you I'm missing."" The thing is, I don't even know what was special about me. After this I left the Level to go on my adventure to this so-called ""Heaven.""

Weird as hell, I know. But I'm seriously amazed that I can recall this much of it. If you have any input on what any of this could mean or even just some kind of input I'd love to hear it.

890,Recurring dream of killing something threatening?,Dreams,"Hello r/Dreams!

&#x200B;

I was wondering if I could discuss with you a recurring dream that I have. I am confused about what it could mean. Also, curious if anyone has similar dreams?

&#x200B;

In it, I am doing something neutral-- walking, or in my home, or driving, when I encounter something threatening. It has been a man in the back of my car, an evil-looking little boy, or snakes. They approach me, and it turns to chasing. Finally, the threatening thing gets close enough for me to reach, and I grab it, and using my own hands I kill it. 

Afterwards, I feel regret, that the threatening being didn't have to die, but I didn't know how else to defend myself. After the snake dream, my friend appeared and showed me how to catch the snakes and throw them off to the side without harming them. So it is a mix of apprehension, terror, and guilt/regret. I've had dreams like this for the past six months but they are getting more frequent, now it is once a week. 

&#x200B;

Any thoughts or questions would be very much appreciated, thank you!",0,recurring dream killing something threatening hello r dream x b wondering could discus recurring dream confused could mean also curious anyone similar dream x b something neutral walking home driving encounter something threatening man back car evil looking little boy snake approach turn chasing finally threatening thing get close enough reach grab using hand kill afterwards feel regret threatening die know else defend snake dream friend appeared showed catch snake throw side without harming mix apprehension terror guilt regret dream like past six month getting frequent week x b thought question would much appreciated thank

893,Dream about a Hindu school and Buddha gazebo,Dreams,"Last night I had a dream that I was enrolled in a Hindu school. The weird thing is that there was nothing to do with Hinduism in the whole dream but I just knew it was a Hindu school (if that even exists). The school had Harry Potter like architecture and a big gazebo overseeing a valley with mountains. The floor of the gazebo was the cracked face of a giant Buddha statue, and there was a crack in between that and the earth, which a lot of students fell down (I guess they just died? lmao).

So in this school there is a bunch of teenagers, including people from one of my close friend’s school (she wasn’t there) and one of my friends who recently moved back to New Zealand. We sat in the Harry Potter-esque hall while the teacher took attendance. In this school we just did painting, running and sitting while wearing golf attire.

The only thing I remember clearly from this dream is that I went back to my old school, which is my current school in real life, and told my friends that I wanted to come back to that school. I also asked them if anyone had said anything about me while I was gone, and they all completely ignored me, but when I asked them anything else they would answer me.

This whole dream was so fucking weird, I just had to share it here.

A few nights ago I had a dream that started with my brother ending up in the hospital for reasons I don't remember. The rest of the dream consisted of me walking home from the hospital. A bunch of random stuff happened, for example, I met a nice English lady that gave me a gift basket. Towards the end of the dream I think I got hit by a car or something because my right hip and right wrist were hurting (I remember being chased by a car but I dont remember if it hit me or why I was in pain.) I eventually made it home and thats when I started slowly waking up. Everything from the dream faded but the pain was still there. I was laying on the side that was hurting so I thought maybe I was laying my hip on top of my phone? I brushed my hand underneath me trying to move whatever I was laying on. But nope, nothing there. By that point I was fully conscious and I rolled onto my back and the pain slowly went away.

895,Jonah Hill will end the race war!,Dreams,"All day I've been thinking of Jonah Hill, after asking my self why several times throughout the day I finally remmeber why!

""The saviour has come! Our saviour has come!"" My friend came rushing into the room almost breaking the door down as he entered. ""Have you seen this JJ? This is crazy, the race war is finally over!""  He said whilst still stumbling through the door. I was trying to make out what he was saying but he was speaking as fast as an auctioneer. Before I could figure out what he said he shoved his phone in my face. 

There it was...Jonah Hill standing there with a two big gold chains on, some Gucci slides that seemed at least two sizes too big and a two piece new york Knicks tracksuit. In the video he was playing some classical music whilst shouting like a crazy Armageddon preacher on the street. He wasn't talking about the end of the world though, he was talking about the end of the war. ""I have now declared the race war to be over."" He repeated this 3 times and followed with, ""under my command no man or woman will hate another race of people ever again!"" To which everyone was cheering and people had begun crying. 

I looked to my friend and asked if this was serious, we both knew Jonah from back in school but he was never the type to do something like this. I mean we knew he would be something one day but I thought he'd just go into acting or something like that. 

Then suddenly I was pulled in too, his voice was repeating in my mind and I could see the error of my ways! I jumped out of my seat and shook my friend. ""The race war is fucking over man! Let's go out and celebrate!"" We both ran out the house to meet some people and talk about how Jonah hill is the greatest man alive, as we approached the corner we saw the man himself. It was Jonah! He gave us both a massive hug but when he opened his mouth to talk he sounded like a car alarm going off.

897,"I attacked someone in my dream, and it was empowering",Dreams,"Last night I had what I consider a ""scary dream"". Me and two family members were trying to escape an attic of a very run down ruin of a mansion. The only way out was through the little attic door thing that's basically just a square hole on the ground/ceiling. My two family members went down first, cautiously. When it was my turn an owl suddenly propped itself between me and the exit. It had such a presence that it scared me, but yet I looked it in the eyes and went down anyways(this made me feel brave and strong). Before getting all the way down, I saw that my family members had not yet escaped. There was a deranged, crazy man blocking them from escaping. He seemed lethal, evil, and his eyes were that of a phsycopath. Now, in waking life, I have had this semi conscious fear of being a coward when shit hits the fan. I always want to be that person who takes action and protects others. The person who isn't a bystander and doesn't freeze with shock. But because I've never been in many situations that have tested me in that way, I keep this fear that when something happens, I might cower. And I hate that.
But in this dream, in that moment with this psycopath threatening my family's safety, I realized just how brave I really am. Despite how terrifying the vibe of the dream was, I launched myself at this man and attacked with all my force. He laughed in my face as I grabbed at his eyes. 
Then the dream ended.
It may have been what some people would categorize as a nightmare, but it was such a thrilling and empowering experience.

899,Dreaming that I die young.,Dreams,"I’ve been having different variations on a dream where I have some unknown reason that’s going to make me die soon. It’s freaking me out because it’s the third time I had this sort of dream.

The first time picked up when I apparently actually died, and I was watching the world as a ghost. I was so sad and so hurt that I was dead and alone... but for some reason, I was distraught that I’d never see my sister again. All I wanted to do was be with her one more time and apologize that I didn’t get to see her go to college. Somehow, I summoned her to where I was, and we hugged and cried because she wouldn’t remember our interaction after she returned back to life. It’s strange because we’re not very close irl.

The second time, I dreamt I was in my bed, waiting to die, and many people I knew kneeled down to me and spoke with me. I’m not sure how it ended.

The one I just had really hit me for some reason. I was living in some reality where my unknown disease was probably going to kill me within the day, so my parents threw an event for me to be with friends and relatives with my time left. I guess eventually, I passed on, and woke up to a situation in my memories long, long ago. I looked to my right, and my father was there.

We started walking around this fragment in time, when all of the sudden, we realized some of my other memories were bleeding into this one, pieces of photos, maps of where I’ve been... I think we saw it as a way to save me. Like a portal into my past, if we can change something from these memories, I can keep living.

We kept exploring the memories, a lot of which I’m not sure I’ve ever had before, and I kept feeling weaker until I just collapsed in my dad’s arms. I guess we failed.

Almost asleep but not quite, I lay trying to quiet my mind. A calm sweeps over me, and my eyes are closed but I see strange creatures. Bug-like, intelligent, brightly colored - vivid blues and purples. Three I saw, two protecting one that was different from them. There was an ominous feeling and one of the protectors ripped a chunk off of the different one. At first I felt the panic and betrayal of the injured creature, as though I were it. My perspective then shifted to that of the one who caused the injury, a male, and I suddenly realized this was a part of the creature’s growth, their lifecycle. He spoke telepathically of his sadness at the pain he’d caused and the other answered him, female, of how it was necessary and they would help it through the rest. It had to shed its outer skin to become like them; these protectors never betrayed what I now knew to be the younger creature but were simply helping it grow. Then they worked together to strip it of the rest of its outer shell, in a much more relaxed, slower, and healing way, revealing a terrific green dragon within. My vision centered and zoomed on its face as it peered back at me, like looking into a mirror.

As a child when my parents were still together, they used to bicker and argue a lot but things never got physical between them and my dad would usually come apologize for fighting in front if me afterward.

Then he put her arm and heart in the freezer. The dream closed off with me staring into the freezer at her (still beating) heart and severed arm.

915,Drew blood from a stone,Dreams,"I entered through a set of double doors, walking out onto a walkway in the sky. The walkway joined together in a sort of symmetrical network of pathways, with the space between them being open pits into the sky. Everyone was wearing scrubs colored based on the group they arrived with. I walked around for a bit, exploring. Before long I started to realize I was trapped in this courtyard in the sky. 

Around this time people started to pair off in male-female couples with others from a different color of scrubs. At that time I decided to leap over the railing into the sky. Because I’ve had so many dreams of falling/flying the sensation always makes me go lucid. So I flew around the compound with resembled a sort of futuristic castle. The network of walkways reminiscent of a courtyard hosting a ball. 

I decided to fly as high as I could go. As I ascended into darkness I found myself in a room with a stone that looked more like a mass of unearthed roots. It had the same sort of shape as the walkway. I felt a female presence in the room. I noticed an exposed end of the stone where I could see what was at the core of the graphite tube. It was a deep shade of purple. It looked like a petrified medium rare steak. 

I reached out and touched it. The stone receded from my hand when I applied pressure, almost as if I had absorbed its essence. It’s blood poured out onto the floor. The female presence watched patiently. 

And then, suddenly there was another. She quickly began to swirl the blood on the floor, painting it into a shape that got up and came to life. She began to consume the stone, forcing creation from its blood. 

I panicked, begging her to stop. She continued frenziedly.

917,Dream of being in the passenger seat and not being able to stop the car,Dreams,"It began with a bee stuck in my hair. It was repeatedly stinging my scalp, every time I tried to pick it up with my fingers it stung even more aggressively. Then the dream changed to me sitting in a car stuck in traffic. I was in the passenger side and nobody was in the drivers seat which was strange. All of a sudden the car started rolling very fast into the road and I couldn’t stop it, I was panicking and trying to lift the emergency break but nothing could stop the car. It quickly hit somebody else’s car and scratched all the left side, I was freaking out and worried about the driver attacking me/cussing me out/calling the police but the guy I crashed into was actually nice and not angry. Then it switched to me in his car and he was driving me to where I needed to go, I was surprised by how kind he was to me and my dream self even felt ‘love’ for this kind stranger. Then the dream went on to me buying knitting supplies (I don’t knit) and other random unremarkable dream-like situations.

I was in this sort of camp with a bunch of other people, including a gang of thugs. They were actually nice, because they wanted to join in on the hoop twirling.

Anyway, one of the people there was this girl who was nothing but torso. No legs, no arms, just a torso and a head. The leader of the gang said she was going to be killed in 2 days.

I felt bad so her and I had some talks. She looked like a mixture of Tomie from Junji Ito and Tomoko Kuroki from Watamote. 

One day the gang said her time was coming, and all I remember is cuddling up with her and holding her close.

She whispered, “I don’t want to leave you.”

I hugged her closer and said, “I won’t let you.”

We saw in the next room this guy who was shot in the head, and the executioners started coming toward us.

That’s where it ended. I didn’t get to see her death, but I’m glad.

924,"Dream about my mother, a drawing she did I never knew about and her friends house.",Dreams,"The dream started in a van. A group of us were trying to figure out what house my mom had drawn in this secret drawing some lady had. I took one look and knew it was her friend from years ago that we spent a lot of time with, although the dream house wasn’t her actual house from real life. 

I asked for a copy of the image and the woman was so weird about giving it to me. Said my mom would only want family to have it, explained I was her daughter and she said she’d think about it. 

When we got to the house I found out it had new owners but we were allowed in. Hit me then that my mom had died. I was rushing room to room being flooded with memories and getting increasingly more upset. 

I ended up in an office type room with small windows and lots of picture albums. I started going through them and finding tons of pictures of us with my mom and pictures of my cousin who (in real life) passed last year (the anniversary is coming up).

925,The strangest dream I've ever had.,Dreams,"So, this dream was kinda peculiar. I was a part of a group that consisted of my friends that went into a game show. We did well enough to get second place but we didnt win. Afterward, we arrived back home and went our separate ways. I came home to my mom, dad, sister, and grandmother. We sat and talked about the show for a while but then my dad decided me, my mom, my sister and himself, should go say hi to my other grandmother on his side of the family. We pack up the car and head off. 

We arrive and after talking for a bit there was a weird issue with an electronics box (I could not make it out it was small and rectangular like a DVD player or cable box but idk). All of a sudden I just see white and I wake up in a hospital bed in an all white room and I look around and I see there is only a red tube connecting me into a machine in the room. I start to freak out a bit but then I notice there is two other people next to me. A young boy that looked like he was about 12/13 with really dark red hair and a girl with black that looked as if she was about my age (22) but could be a little younger. I try to call out to them but they couldnt hear me and after struggling to get their attention for a bit I fell out of the bed which caused the red tube to fall out of me as well.

As soon as the tube fell out everything went black and I looked above me and I saw a light leaving from me and i proceeded to fall down back into the white bed again. But this time there were people around talking. The boy and the girl were next to me awake talking. They notice me come to and began to ask me things. They ask me like what caused me to he here, what happened to my tube, and other questions to try to figure me out. I saw their tubes were gone and asked them what happened to theirs and they explained that they had similar events happen as well. The boy was walking past a building when something happened and he woke up here and the girl heard yelling outside of her class when she woke up in the hospital. After hearing their stories, I understood that we were in the afterlife. 

The I freaked out for a while and began to cry, but then I started to run around the hospital to try and find my family but no one was there. I returned back to the room to see them watching something on the TV and I sat next to them in my bed watching it with them.  

After that everything, about the dream was super fuzzy and I cant remember anything else, the main thing I can kinda remember is it kinda turned into a funny dream afterward. This was really the strangest dream I've had in a while. Really ive only had depressing or dark/scary dreams recently, so even though this was grim in a way I kind of enjoyed it. What was weirder was that it felt like everything was real, like I felt everything that happened in the dream like the light (which i assume was my soul) leaving me. Idk how else I can put it. 

Can anyone try to help me figure this out? I know it seems like it's just random but idk why its stuck with me. I've been up for hours now and it won't go away.

926,"I had the weirdest dream where something possessed a person - hijacking my dream - and told me (not the dream me, but the real me) to remember a series of numbers",Dreams,"I had the weirdest dream last night (a novel line on this sub, I'm sure).

&#x200B;

I was talking with some random strangers at a circular table and we were having some kind of  unintelligible dream conversation - you know, kind of like the one you're participating in but you're not really sure what you or they are saying (but you don't seem to notice because it's apart of the dream) and suddenly the person on my right got -  possessed for lack of a better word - and suddenly looked straight at me.

It snapped me sober, for lack of a better word and I looked right back at it. I wish I could remember what it looked like - shortish from what I can recall and maybe not entirely human - but not scary. Like it felt like it was making eye contact right at me, and not the dream me -  like it was breaking the fourth wall of the dream. Any of you remember Assassin Creed 2's ending? Something like that final conversation of that complete shock of a fourth wall break.

It said something along the lines of ""Remember this: 9 1 1"" in a weird - but not creepy - voice. I think the numbers ""1 1 1 1, or 1 1 1 4"" or something like that were included after the ""9 1 1"" as well. But the 911 came first, as if it was its own message, then the other numbers came. The second batch of numbers are a little fuzzier so I could be wrong on those but I DISTINCTLY  remember the 911. The 911 part though wasn't scary to me, it didn't feel to me like a warning, urgent, or deadly serious - it was just in a neutral tone. I wasn't scared at all, in fact.

So, sorry, dream-thing, I guess I couldn't remember all of the message you were trying to tell me.

I very rarely have lucid dreams and lately my dreams have been hazy, but I  remember this vividly as if it was a memory in real life. Then  literally everything went black and it told me all cryptic-like ""You'll know what it means""  or ""You figure it out"". I forget the exact vernacular, but that was the general gist of it, and again it didn't feel like some kind of an ominous warning. And then immediately I woke up incredibly confused.

Anyone have an idea what in the in actual world was that? I usually don't have crazy dreams like that, especially ones where I felt like the people I'm talking to are  actually trying to talk to me in the real world.

927,"The devil is visiting my dreams, any ideas?",Dreams,"As I fall asleep in my dream I woke up on this train platform. I kept clinging to the floor so I wouldn’t fall as if I was super high up in the clouds, but in actuality I never actually left the train platform it was inside this train station. I never saw the outside of it. The entire time I was asleep I had realized I was sleeping so knew this was just a dream. I realized because of how the train stationed felt like I was above the clouds about to fall even though I was underground. I live in New York so it looked similar to the modern train subway station on grand central 42nd, but it was much more older like a modern take on a old fashioned look. Then eventually everything went to all white. Then I saw the imagery appear almost like paint of an old building that was morphing. While it did I was starting to focus at the top of the roof, then the paint like construct started look more like the roof. Then like paint everything became white once more like a purgatory state (only inside I felt like it wasn’t purgatory). This Deer/Elk looking thing with antlers appeared. My immediate thought was the devil. Then the Deer/Elk looking thing grew bigger and it tried attacking me. It was silent the entire time but I felt inside that it was after me, planning on capturing my soul and fusing it with it. Even though I knew it was a dream I could not wake up. I felt in real life that I was sitting in chair dozing off asleep and my body immediately became number as I tried to consciously wake myself up. I knew where I was in real time/real life but I couldn’t force myself to wake up and the monster kept getting bigger and bigger and closer to me. I began to see myself in real time. It doesn’t make sense what I’m going to describe but it felt as if I was still seeing what was in front of me in first person while seeing myself 3rd person even though I couldn’t actually see myself. Then I started yelling, “Go Away!” At the top of my lungs. As I yelled the Deer/Elk monster thing got smaller in size and I started to grow bigger. I breathed in again and this time I yelled “Ahhh!” Then after the craziest dream ever I woke up and thought to myself that was the most insane dream I ever had. Only 3 minutes had passed by. The most interesting thing to me was that the Deer/Elk thing never actually made a sound, as I was yelling I was the one that had the deep demonic voice. Any ideas as to what this could represent? I work as an overnight security guard, I fell asleep at 3:50 am and woke up at 3:54 am. I had no food, I drank a red bull to stay up, I was not watching any scary films or stories, and I have had a scary dream before where I get my body taken over by a dark figure. I never had a dream with a deer elk but I have had dreams where a dark liquids or dark clouds of ash/dust like substance forces its way into my body but never at work this is the first time and it was way off. I am not religious or spiritual. This is the first time I ever encountered a paint like substance that could morph and change the way everything looks.

929,Bizarre dream,Dreams,"If I've ever dreamt about celebrities, I don't remember, but I like to think that I'm mostly confident that I don't really tend to dream of celebrities at all. I've never been the kind of person to have a crush on famous people. And there's not many in particular that I look up to because I figure whatever I like about them are traits I have imposed on my own image of them.

So, knowing that, I dreamt about Rob Lowe last night.

It's not like he's one of the superstars right now, not like a Marvel superhero or Keanu Reeves or something. The only shows I remember him from were Parks and Rec, which I watched about a year ago, and The West Wing.

Anyway, in my dream, it appeared to be a world where there were several copies or clones of Rob Lowe. I remember going to an event at a park that I don't think I've ever been to, and spotting him on his way to the stage. The people there were all roughly my demographic; aka, the exact audience you might expect to enjoy Parks and Rec. I have seen them all before, I go to school with some probably, or have in the past. They were all very excited to see him.

Rob Lowe walks right past me, and I start to greet him with something familiar, like I had met him before. The way I would greet a friend. He stops to look at me, and I recognize that he's never seen me before. I didn't automatically assume that he just didn't remember, like I might for an actual encounter with a celebrity, but instead I knew that I had the wrong Rob Lowe. 

There were several copies of him that existed all over the world. I don't know how I knew this, because it was never expressed in the dream. But I knew that this Rob Lowe was not the Rob Lowe who I and several of my peers had met before in the past. There were quite a few just in my state. This was something he was famous for, apparently. He was doing something like a tour, except it wasn't so much of a tour since the clones never had to travel very far, and he had to be doing stand up or something similar.

Anyway, overall very strange dream. I remember being totally bummed out that the Rob Lowe that had come was not the Rob Lowe I had met before. My friends were as well. 

I think the strangest thing about the dream was that I didn't remember his name. I knew him, I knew where he had acted and stuff, but in the dream and in real life, I just had completely forgotten what his name was. I had to look it up before I began typing this.

As usual, within a dream, you never really question what's happening and why. Only now am I beginning to wonder what the hell was going on. Where did all of those Rob Lowes come from? Did they all share some sort of mental connection, like a hive mind? Why were there so many of them? Which one starred in Parks and Rec within my dreamworld? Are some Rob Lowes more famous than others, and do they have ways of distinguishing themselves from one another? If the premise wasn't so bizarre, I might want to write some sort of science fiction short story just to try and answer all of those questions.",0,bizarre dream ever dreamt celebrity remember like think mostly confident really tend dream celebrity never kind person crush famous people many particular look figure whatever like trait imposed image knowing dreamt rob lowe last night like one superstar right like marvel superhero keanu reef something show remember park rec watched year ago west wing anyway dream appeared world several copy clone rob lowe remember going event park think ever spotting way stage people roughly demographic aka exact audience might expect enjoy park rec seen go school probably past excited see rob lowe walk right past start greet something familiar like met way would greet friend stop look recognize never seen automatically assume remember like might actual encounter celebrity instead knew wrong rob lowe several copy existed world know knew never expressed dream knew rob lowe rob lowe several peer met past quite state something famous apparently something like tour except much tour since clone never travel far stand something similar anyway overall strange dream remember totally bummed rob lowe come rob lowe met friend well think strangest thing dream remember name knew knew acted stuff dream real life completely forgotten name look began typing usual within dream never really question happening beginning wonder hell going rob lowes come share sort mental connection like hive mind many one starred park rec within dreamworld rob lowes famous others way distinguishing one another premise bizarre might want write sort science fiction short story try answer question

He was obsessed with the idea of killing me and he had nothing to lose. I kept dreaming about police or my parents or friends trying to stop him. They would threaten to take legal action or arrest him and he didn’t care.

933,Anyone ever feel excruciating pain in a dream? Also this was the weirdest dream I've ever had.,Dreams,"I've had two dreams where I felt actual fucking pain ever, and they both happened last week. At the start of my dream I'm wandering through a flesh cave (a cave made of flesh) and I fall to the floor because of an intense pain I felt in my right side, a bit below the armpit. I scream out in pain, and my dad walks into view and says, ""that's your sphincter,"" which is weird, cause my dad usually gives sound medical advice. As I walk through the cave I reach this room that's actually made of stone, and in this room there are hundreds of around 3 feet diameter divots where small, bluish grey creatures lay in fetal position, sleeping. As I enter I feel the pain again and throw up because of it. This wakes one of these creatures up, so he sits up and looks at me with reflective white eyes and says, ""we are going to eat that,"" and I reply, ""I am going to watch you,"" then I fucking left. I'm transported (as dreams do) to my friends driveway and I start walking, and as I do, I feel the pain again and I fall to the ground. I look up to see a figure that I could not identify, but I could tell you that it seemed to be a 2d being illustrated in pink and white.

934,Frequent dreams of being alone at my own wedding & being a single mom,Dreams,"To preface this, I’m 27F and very much single. Have been single for years with a few flings here and there that have never amounted to anything. I’m happy in all other aspects of my life (career, friends, family) but I sometimes wish I had that special someone. 

Over the last year or so, I’ve been having frequent dreams of getting married and having a baby, but I’m alone in all of these dreams. 

In the dreams where I’m getting married, I’m getting ready to walk down the aisle and I’m surrounded by my friends and family but it’s almost like my husband doesn’t exist. I can’t picture him at all and I never get to the part of the dream where we’re together.

In the dreams where I have a baby, I’m so happy being a mom and taking care of my baby, but I’m also alone in these dreams. There’s never anyone else there and it doesn’t seem like there ever was.

936,Help interpreting please..?,Dreams,"I have been dreaming about my ex for 10 years now. I admittedly did not get over him for about 8 in my waking life, with hope of somehow getting back with him. But feel like after a lot of inner work and healing I finally let him go. The dreams stopped for a short time. For a while I was literally having them at least about twice a week. Super emotional and felt so real and would wake up in emotional knots feeling like I was going to just fall apart in sadness over how painful it was. I have been with a new man for 5 years, married for 2. In these dreams, so many times I find my ex. He tells me he forgives me (the break up was my fault over cheating... I loved my ex more than anyone ever but I was very damaged and had a cheating problem from my past) anyway, he forgives me and then we cuddle and kiss and he accepts me back. It often involves me saying, I need to divorce my husband and be with you. I love you so much etc. WHY do I keep having these dreams?? They are so torturous. I love my husband very much. We have conflict, where with my ex not much, but this current relationship I have grown SO much through the conflict and feel it is a spiritual partnership of growth..I dont want to leave him but when I am honest, heart still misses ex. I believe dreams are a reflection of self... I have tried to look at it like he is my anima, but why is it HIM every single time. And even then I still cant interpret it. So hard to look at neutrally when the emotions are so intense. I suppose my subconscious knows what its doing but I am not getting the message obviously.

937,Psychological Dream about my family/other?,Dreams,"So in my dream I woke up one morning and I had somebody else's face transplanted into the side of my head (nose, eyeballs, and mouth). I'm looking in the mirror and the face is contorting in weird ways, but it doesn't appear to be capable of thinking or speaking it's just the vestigial features of a face. Immediately concerned and freaked out by the fact that there's a foreign face growing on the side of my head, I go downstairs and ask my parents about it. My parents have no look of worry or anything, they act like this is completely normal and that there's nothing to be worried about. 

A few minutes later I somehow magically know that my dad sedated me while I was asleep and I underwent surgery to have this face put into my head (I saw this in 3rd person), dream logic I guess. I confront my mom about it and she says ""Oh your dad loves helping people, think about it honey you're giving someone else a new chance at life.""

This face has no brain and it's not capable of thinking or speaking, just weird facial expressions. How is that a new chance at life exactly, is what I'm thinking. 

So life goes on as normal (except for the fact that in the dream I never go to school or out in public). A few days later I wake up with 2 more faces on the other side of my head. One is a full sized face exactly like the other and then there is also like a half face with it. I guess there's not much in the way of my thinking at this point, but I just feel so helpless that I can't do anything about these faces that are appearing. They all have the same behavior as the first face. 

So life goes on again and then where my head was shaved for these face transplants the hair starts growing back and the faces gradually start to disappear. Then the dream ends. 

So I question the reason I might have a dream like this and I can think of a one. I'm not feeling like I have enough control in my life and I'm still living with my parents, etc...(I'm 18 years old)

I just find it really disturbing that I had to helplessly watch as the faces were being put in and then having to live with them, and not being able to do anything about it. So overall the creepiness factor was through the roof. From what my mom said in the dream I can only think that the faces belonged to the survivors of accidents, otherwise the thing about it being a new life for them wouldn't make any sense. Then I also remember harboring some sort of feeling of guilt that I couldn't live with the faces because they've had a tougher life than I have. Also, if my dad cared so much for the faces why did they have to be transplanted onto my head? Why not his head or any other member of my family? 

Anyways, this dream might be absolute bs or it could be stress related, I'm not quite sure. It felt like something straight out of sci-fi and my out of body experiences from when I was sleeping within the dream didn't help.

938,A maze?,Dreams,"I had 2 dreams about lives that I never lived, like an alternate universe of my current life. One thing that stuck out the most was the architecture of the alleyway .It was during what seemed to be in the afternoon with pink skies. The alley was clean, the buildings were clean, everything looked amazing. Windows and doorways on both sides. I could tell I was in a high end area but I couldn’t really pinpoint where exactly how far I was from a particular location, it just seemed like I was in a really nice walkway between two apartment buildings at all times. At the time I was visiting a friend that lived in Europe that I knew for a while and we used to hook up occasionally. I had memories  of this universe like I’ve been here my whole life.

In this dream I find out I have a child that I didn’t know about. I’ve always wanted a child.
 
I woke up and remembered every detail. The scent of her house, the tall white buildings, the stiffness of her belly while she was pregnant, her voice was clear and loud like she was standing right next to me.I remembered shared memories with her when we first met. I felt so complete. When I woke up, I was overwhelmed with sadness, wishing that it was all real. I felt anger and confusion to how my mind convinced me that everything was real.

Now in real time a few years has past since I’ve had that dream but I always think about it.

Recently I had another dream where I was eating with my sister. 

I walk out of my house and there I am, in that same clean beautiful alleyway.  My sister told me to meet her at  this Indian restaurant. On my way there it seemed like I was walking through a network of walkways and intersections but for some reason I knew exactly where to go. I get to the restaurant and paid for my sisters meal. The employees shouting my name the whole time like I go there often.After we’re done eating I walk outside and instantly get an over view picture of where I was at like I’m looking down on a maze. In this maze I could see where my special friend lived like I was in the same dream but different location. Like I was right down the road from her house but she didn’t exist in this dream. I was literally in my dream recalling another dream which caused me to wake up

I could never recall my dreams but those dreams I remember like it happened just a few moments ago. I can remember every detail about them but what’s really strange was the whole maze. Why a maze? What does it mean?",0,maze dream life never lived like alternate universe current life one thing stuck architecture alleyway seemed afternoon pink sky alley clean building clean everything looked amazing window doorway side could tell high end area really pinpoint exactly far particular location seemed like really nice walkway two apartment building time time visiting friend lived europe knew used hook occasionally memory universe like whole life dream find child know always wanted child woke remembered every detail scent house tall white building stiffness belly pregnant voice clear loud like standing right next remembered shared memory first met felt complete woke overwhelmed sadness wishing real felt anger confusion mind convinced everything real real time year past since dream always think recently another dream eating sister walk house clean beautiful alleyway sister told meet indian restaurant way seemed like walking network walkway intersection reason knew exactly go get restaurant paid sister meal employee shouting name whole time like go often done eating walk outside instantly get view picture like looking maze maze could see special friend lived like dream different location like right road house exist dream literally dream recalling another dream caused wake could never recall dream dream remember like happened moment ago remember every detail really strange whole maze maze mean
939,slack jawed humanoid thing stalked me in a dream and I woke up feeling ill,Dreams,"I had a nightmare that was oddly like...not horrifying.  Just immensely quietly scary if that makes any sense at all. Like a noiseless panicked dread. In the dream, I was doing what I normally do in the mornings, waiting for my brother so I could take him to school. But when I went to my own room, the windows were open, and by that I mean the blinds were all gone. I saw a white truck parked outside, it seemed the guy inside was watching and I felt a really chill fear come over me. I say ""him"" very loosely,  it was more of an It. Its cliché but I guess clichés still can freak me out.  It had awful white flesh, like inhumanly white. Its mouth was large, it's long,large crooked teeth jutting out and making the large mouth look malformed.  It looked slack jawed, but not like a broken jaw. Its mouth just didnt seem like it could close. Its eyes looked pale and unfocused, like really light blue fish eyes.  It had no ears, and no hair on its head and said head was shaped like a slightly pointy egg. Smaller up top and wider on bottom, again because of those awfully big jagged teeth in it's wide mouth. Sorry to over explain the guy-thing. I know it details my nightmare explanation, but He was the reason it was a nightmare.   Anyway that thing was parked outside my windows,  I quietly dropped to the floor checking to see if he was looking at me. It didnt seem like it. I shuffled backwards slowly on my belly.  Back until I could get away, I got into my parents lifted truck and laid on the floor of it. Peeking, seeing the white truck drive slowly away from the window and around, to where my car and my parents truck was. The thing got out of its truck, and went to my car. Seeing I wasnt in it, the guy thing searched the car a little.  From the window of where I was hiding I saw my brother in the distance.  I wanted to shout to him but that would alert the guy thing, and I wanted so desperately as I heard the thing get closer and the truck door opening to run away, fast towards my little brother but i think i was afraid it would get him too. So i lay motionless on my belly as i feel the truck's door open and its hand grips my ankle as I'm dragged out. It seemed so slow and painless.  I remember hearing words that weren't my voice in my head. I cant remember exactly and I'm frustrated but I remember they were horrifying to me, but instilled a sense of peace and acceptance that it would be over soon. It felt dull, numb, it felt like I was compressed or crunched up into a small box until I just wasn't anymore. Everything was black. 
That's it. I woke up feeling weak, my stomach feels bad and I'm hot. Yes, this illness was probably the cause of the nightmare in the first place, but I just felt so shitty after this nightmare.  Also I think it's weird that the guy things  face looked only vaguely humanoid but it wore a longsleeve blue shirt. Maybe denim idk.

On a television, there was a report that a missile had been launched from India. Then the power went out. One of the clearest things I remember was panic. I was certain my town was gonna get hit, that I was doomed. Some time later, power comes back on, TV reports that ""only"" 15 missiles had been fired, a couple locations on the east coast of the US, a few in India, a few in the middle east/africa. NYC got hit. There was video footage of what they were calling the ""sea of glass""; an enourmous melted stretch of windows that had been fused into a plain with tall jagged spikes in it. Also remember footage being played of liquified human remains flowing through the streets like a stream.

941,Sleep paralysis concern/help,Dreams,"So I rarely experience sleep paralysis (maybe twice a year) and they have not made me feel frightened. Every other time I cannot move for what feels like around 5 seconds and can move an arm or leg to wake up properly.

Tonight I woke up half paralysed lying sideways and heard an extremely scary version of my own voice laughing softly and moving quickly to each corner of the ceiling. I then heard my family through the window opening the front door and walking straight past my door (not real) and soon my mum walked to the door. Instead of opening it to help me she did that same laugh outside my room and left.

The whole time I could slightly move my back (curled lying sideways) and even open my mouth and get some quiet noise out but it was extremely difficult. Im not sure if I was awake the whole because part of it I imagined myself crawling to the door and knocking (when mum came to door) but I somehow was back in bed straight after. 

I managed to wake up by putting all my strength into shaking my head side to side, but am now in bed shivering and scared to go back to sleep. Just wondering if this type of thing is normal for people who get sleep paralysis or if i should be concerned about my mental health. Also any tips on what to do in these situations would be helpful.

I couldn't remember where the snackbar was but eventually found it. I ordered some fries. Then I dropped a bag with documents I had took with me and the content spilled on the floor. Someone helped me and I was embarrassed by that. It was late so I had to get back to the office. I never got my fries.

Then I woke up.
 
After that I had another dream where I was talking to my friend about the first dream and tried to figure out what it meant.

Then I woke up.

946,Weird Dreams,Dreams,"So, I've been having really weird dreams for the last few months. Before this, I'd remember my dreams for about 10 minutes before forgetting them completely, but now, I'm able to remember small details for weeks. I think a large part of this is due to what actually happens in my dreams. Let me explain

1) A lot of the dreams I have are borderline nightmares. Not in the way that I feel threatened or scared, but I still wake up Inna cold sweat gasping for air. 

2) The details tend to stick with me for a while  for example, I remember being at my grandmother's house in one of the dreams and I remember the exact conversation we had in the dream.

3) In every dream, I see the same person. It's difficult to describe him, but in my dream he always seems familiar. He doesn't look like anyone famous or like any of me relatives, so I'm unsure what to think.

I've talked to a few friends and a counselor about my experiences, and most of them brought up that school stress can cause stuff like this (since it's my first semester of college) but when they describe what people normally experience, it isn't like what I've experienced.

I don't really know if anyone has an answer to this, but I'd really like to get some further insight on why this is happening.

950,I died,Dreams,"In my dream last night, I died. I was walking out of a mall type building with my family. All of a sudden everything went white. I heard buzzing in my ears and I “woke up” in a room. The walls were blank white screens that said “YOU DIED” in bold red letters. There was lots of white noise and alarms that went off every few minutes and the text on the walls would flash. I tried getting out of the door but it wouldn’t open. It was an illusion. I could see some of the living world, but it seemed to be destroyed. Like an asteroid hit earth, nothing was left but rubble. After crying and screaming for an hour or so, it finally stopped and I woke up in the real world again.

952,Girlfriend woke me from sobbing in my dream?,Dreams,"So my girlfriend just woke me up asking me if I was okay. She tells me that I was saying “I’m sorry” and sobbing. I was coming to my senses and realized what happened in my dream was not real and I started laughing! She asks me if I woke her up to prank her and I told her no. She says I was sobbing and I tell her what happened in my dream. I tell her:

 “I think my brain was trying to make me upset? There were 2 short segments in my dream that were upsetting. We had a lizard in it’s enclosure and apparently it was dying, and I was watching it’s soul leave it’s body. But you read online that if the lizard moves an object in its enclosure he’s gonna be okay. The lizard wasn’t doing anything and it was closing it’s eyes. Until it finally moved something with its mouth and we were relieved. Then the second segment was me being a superhero character. I was going through a house at night going to fight some bad guys or something or maybe I was the bad guy? And explosion or two went off and I hid under the kitchen counter and I look at my hands. There was little blood drops on them. And all of a sudden “CUUUUUT!” The lights brighten and all along I was actually playing a character on a SUPERHERO TV SHOW. The other actors came up to me and asked if I was okay. They also said that we gotta keep going and if the creator of the show was here he would’ve cancelled filming for the day. And all I could say was ‘I’m sorry.’ I was sobbing so much I couldn’t breathe or get words out properly. And then you woke me up.”

953,Bazinga.,Dreams,"So, this *phenomenon* was somewhere between a dream and a hypnagogic hallucination. I was falling asleep, and it was sort of lucid. Anyhow, it was the theme song to the childrens’ TV show Dinosaur Train, which I watched a lot when I was little. It came to the title screen, and then a small, straight-faced image of Sheldon from Big Bang Theory popped onto the screen and said, “Bazinga.” in a monotone voice, but his mouth didn’t move. And then the dream would repeat itself, except Sheldon would appear in a different place on the screen this time. This happened about three times.  
  
Edit: After the third time or so, I saw Michael Jordan from the ‘stop it. get some help.’ ad, and he said the line, except he had Mike Tyson’s tattoo and spoke with a lisp.",0,bazinga phenomenon somewhere dream hypnagogic hallucination falling asleep sort lucid anyhow theme song childrens tv show dinosaur train watched lot little came title screen small straight faced image sheldon big bang theory popped onto screen said bazinga monotone voice mouth move dream would repeat except sheldon would appear different place screen time happened three time edit third time saw michael jordan stop get help ad said line except mike tyson tattoo spoke lisp

955,"2 Dreams 8, 9, 10 & 11. 8 going to the museum, 9 water dreams, 10 a baldy dream, 11 false awakening",Dreams,"
So ok I don't know if these are two dreams or one it's been awhile and I really don't know if these are separate dreams or one.

So this dreams starts out with me and my family going to a museum, so we get in the truck and we start driving there but then we for some reason make these people made at this stop light or something (it's so blurry with this point that I don't remember what happened exactly since there are two ways I can tell it so I'll hold off)

So then we get to the museum and I'm going up the stairs when I think my family was going downstairs,

Then the same two people came in (I think) and they wanted to find us but they couldn't for some reason that I forgot and so they left.

Now I think if I remember this is a different dream but i forgot so I tell it here,

So in this dream I was wondering around this place trying to get somewhere safe and I think I was in a warehouse or underground (I think it was the warehouse) and the place was flooded with water and while I was swimming to this cab of a truck I didn't look back cause I felt as if I looked back I would see something following me in the water that I didn't want to see so I never looked behind me,

So then I reach the cab and I see water in it and so I didn't get in cause of what might be in the water so then I find this lever and reach as best I can and pull the lever and the water starts to drain and the cab was drained and wasn't that deep, but the main area I was in was deep (like maybe around 50-100 feet if I had to guess)
And I was dangling and then woke up

So in this dream I'm in the nice looking hallway and I then go into one of the doors which then brings me to this one point in the dream where it's like the game baldy but I don't quite know it yet and I'm still exploring to see what would be the best place to run out and escape and then I go into this dark room that seems big,

 so I'd want to do it first if anything so I don't get caught, so I go to the lit area and it's like a maze that I have to move through and I see this one book that I have to get as I would then have to run all over the place getting others,

Then I count to 3 and then grab the note book and run to this one area in this hallway hoping to have a better way

But I saw that it was blocked off as I then turn around and fry to go back but someone like baldy comes to me but I try to go to the left and hug the wall so he couldn't get me but he got me and I then woke up.",0,dream going museum water dream baldy dream false awakening ok know two dream one awhile really know separate dream one dream start family going museum get truck start driving reason make people made stop light something blurry point remember happened exactly since two way tell hold get museum going stair think family going downstairs two people came think wanted find u reason forgot left think remember different dream forgot tell dream wondering around place trying get somewhere safe think warehouse underground think warehouse place flooded water swimming cab truck look back cause felt looked back would see something following water want see never looked behind reach cab see water get cause might water find lever reach best pull lever water start drain cab drained deep main area deep like maybe around foot guess dangling woke dream nice looking hallway go one door brings one point dream like game baldy quite know yet still exploring see would best place run escape go dark room seems big want first anything get caught go lit area like maze move see one book get would run place getting others count grab note book run one area hallway hoping better way saw blocked turn around fry go back someone like baldy come try go left hug wall get got woke
956,Here's a weird-ass dream I had last night,Dreams,"So I was in a church with a bunch of my friends, and somewhere outside (like far away) there was this supervillain creating doomsday devices. The first two were dumb and I don't remember what they were. What I do remember, though, is that before he deployed each one, he would announce it and it's chemical composition, and all of them contained potassium. Including, for some reason, the third and final one, which was a nuclear bomb. Now with the first two devices, we just drove away from it and it didn't do anything to us, but with this one, the person who had driven us said something along the lines of ""we're not getting away from this one."" So we stood in there, just waiting to be incinerated, and soon, there was about 5 seconds of acid rain, followed by bright light starting to come in through the window and the air starting to get warmer. Over the next few seconds, my vision grew white and it got hotter and hotter, but never actually hurt. I rationalized the lack of pain by concluding that my nervous system must have been vaporized before it could register pain. Then I realized that I was still thinking, meaning that this must be a dream, and then I woke up.",0,weird as dream last night church bunch friend somewhere outside like far away supervillain creating doomsday device first two dumb remember remember though deployed one would announce chemical composition contained potassium including reason third final one nuclear bomb first two device drove away anything u one person driven u said something along line getting away one stood waiting incinerated soon second acid rain followed bright light starting come window air starting get warmer next second vision grew white got hotter hotter never actually hurt rationalized lack pain concluding nervous system must vaporized could register pain realized still thinking meaning must dream woke

Then I was in the endless open room with a lot of people. Felt very comfortable and oddly familiar, like I've been there before. I was there for a decent amount of time. Then I saw people passing on to the other side. People just sort of left, they went towards the light to never return. I walked over towards it thinking this would be the end, I go through to never come back. I suddenly realized where I was and what I was about to do. I snapped back to my body and woke up.

958,Babysitting,Dreams,"Was working at a high end resort and was given $30 up front to babysit a guy's three teenage kids for a couple hours. Went around trying to do things outside with them, but they were all behaving poorly, trying to get me in trouble. They all tried to get away from me at some point, which is understandable because they were all at the age where they could take care of themselves for a couple hours (though, based on the behavior they exhibited during the time I was with them, it was probably best that they had someone keeping an eye on them).

After a while, we ended up in an outdoor water center of the resort, with splash pads and a couple of small slides. One teenage kid, separate from the three I was babysitting, was getting roudy and physical with others, so I get the bright idea to restrain him by myself to get him to calm down. Apparently, there were reports of me touching him *down there* until, ahem, completion, so I was charged with child molestation and put on the sex offender list.",0,babysitting working high end resort given front babysit guy three teenage kid couple hour went around trying thing outside behaving poorly trying get trouble tried get away point understandable age could take care couple hour though based behavior exhibited time probably best someone keeping eye ended outdoor water center resort splash pad couple small slide one teenage kid separate three babysitting getting roudy physical others get bright idea restrain get calm apparently report touching ahem completion charged child molestation put sex offender list

A hand met mine and we touched gently, everything around me dissolved into tiny colourfull particles, and swirled around me like a whirlpool.

The whirlpool un raveled itself around me revealing a place i knew well. It was a summer’s morning, everything was new and fresh.

the sun shone down, a meadow of soft grass and pretty flowers streched before me to the jagged coast line, 
in the distance the blue sea shimmered.

And she was there, resting on her knees in front of me, her white cotten dress flowing over her knees, just sitting there smilling at me, fitting right in.

we both got up, slowly we walked the few steps to each other and embraced
like two souls intertwined.

As I drew her tighter to me, she dissolved away into nothing, and everthing around me faded to black.

I'm in an urban/very nice suburban area.  There is a very true to life (a VERY large, very very realistic) lost baby hippo running around that ended up here somehow.  There isn’t a good environment here for it at all here in Concrete Retail Cityish Suburbia and it has a good chance of dying a very uncomfortable death.  So I try to use a cell phone and call some local agencies like the police to try and relocate this poor little hippo to a better location.  This is entirely fruitless as this has “happened before” but the local places and organizations won’t help very large lost animals.


So SUDDENLY I’m inside maybe a coffee cafe like place and two acquaintances of mine, who in real life do not know each other at all, are there.  I was ""in their clique"" and we were a trio but now the two of them are now Best Friends Forever, and without even telling me anything they have decided to “work together” for this hippo.  I am clearly not welcome anymore, I’ve been “third-wheel-zoned”.  

I comment to someone else off camera that both of their families have A LOT of money and influence, and that’s how they get along so well and I don’t have any money or anything, so that’s the main unspoken reason why I am excluded.  


I thought I had a mug and a pack of matches (nestled in the mug) with the proper contact info on them or something ""from before"" to even vaguely help me but on second look the info on the mug and matches is useless.
                   

So then suddenly it turns into a large crowd venue, like an auditorium/concert hall or a stadium.  I’ve been weirdly shot out at the audience, like I was used as a human cannonball, and I roll over so many peoples’ heads and this will make them angry at me.  I feel extremely annoyed and awkward from all this and I want to get out of this stadium ASAP.


The thing that was taking place in the concert hall/stadium is now over and people are ready to leave and I am HURRYING to get out of here as I feel super annoyed from this whole ""day"". I’m trying to climb a ramp following other people leaving.  This is hard because my elderly Mom is with me suddenly and she drags behind not only physically but she wants to chit chat with eeeeeeeeveryone along the way!",0,runaway baby hippo stadium awkwardness fresh week urban nice suburban area true life large realistic lost baby hippo running around ended somehow good environment concrete retail cityish suburbia good chance dying uncomfortable death try use cell phone call local agency like police try relocate poor little hippo better location entirely fruitless happened local place organization help large lost animal suddenly inside maybe coffee cafe like place two acquaintance mine real life know clique trio two best friend forever without even telling anything decided work together hippo clearly welcome anymore third wheel zoned comment someone else camera family lot money influence get along well money anything main unspoken reason excluded thought mug pack match nestled mug proper contact info something even vaguely help second look info mug match useless suddenly turn large crowd venue like auditorium concert hall stadium weirdly shot audience like used human cannonball roll many people head make angry feel extremely annoyed awkward want get stadium asap thing taking place concert hall stadium people ready leave hurrying get feel super annoyed whole day trying climb ramp following people leaving hard elderly mom suddenly drag behind physically want chit chat eeeeeeeeveryone along way
974,Dream of willing going to jail,Dreams,"I had a dream I had the chance to go to a jail to try it out, just as an experience. And my family promised to bail me out whenever I’m ready to get out.

I got the shit beat out of me just for being there pretty much and there was no guards to be found and if they were they didn’t care or take their job seriously. So i always tried finding secluded areas. When i got the opportunity to get on the phone to call my family and tell them i’m ready to get out, they would laugh at my distress and lead on the conversation while i’m begging for them to bail me out. I asked why they wouldn’t and they said “I like an empty house”. And things of that nature, leading me on and i got more stressed and begging to leave.

976,Acceptance of death,Dreams,"Last night or early yesterday morning I had a dream about my death and more importantly accepting my death. 

I was working at a new job building bridges between space and time and different dimensions entirely. I am a large guy and apparently they had never told me that there was a weight limit on these bridges. I stepped onto a platform and it started to sink into the space between dimensions. I grabbed onto the railings to try and pull myself back up, but the railing just sank with me as well. My boss just looked back at me with a sad look and said to the rest of the trainees that there was nothing they could do. 

I started to fall and spin into the void of nothingness. I was crying at first realizing I'd never see my family or my friends again. I'd never be able to start my own family. I'd never get to travel the world or see what I could make of myself beyond my short 20 years on earth. The more I thought about life the more I started to regret.

The G forces of infinitely falling and spinning faster and faster started to make me get woozy and start to fade in and out of consciousness. Finally with my last breath I could muster and one more minute of being able to clearly think, I looked back and realized, even though I'd never be able to say goodbye, I accepted that this was my time to go. The void was going to consume me and my matter and energy would be repurposed somewhere somehow. And I shed two final tears.

These two tears felt like condensed liquid heroin rolling down my cheaks. I felt such euphoria and joy in my final seconds. My family would move and and be happy again. My friends would find a new friend to take my place. And the girl who may or may not have been waiting for me would find love in someone else. I lived a full life for all intensive purposes and that was good enough for me. I closed my eyes one last time and let out that last breath. 

Then in the blink of an eye I woke up with two tears running down my face and smile still on my lips.  I don't fear death. I know it will come for me when it's my time. I know what earth has given me, will take back again. 

Life is to short to be afraid of taking your last breath.

Thanks for listening to my ramble.",0,acceptance death last night early yesterday morning dream death importantly accepting death working new job building bridge space time different dimension entirely large guy apparently never told weight limit bridge stepped onto platform started sink space dimension grabbed onto railing try pull back railing sank well bos looked back sad look said rest trainee nothing could started fall spin void nothingness cry first realizing never see family friend never able start family never get travel world see could make beyond short year earth thought life started regret g force infinitely falling spinning faster faster started make get woozy start fade consciousness finally last breath could muster one minute able clearly think looked back realized even though never able say goodbye accepted time go void going consume matter energy would repurposed somewhere somehow shed two final tear two tear felt like condensed liquid heroin rolling cheaks felt euphoria joy final second family would move happy friend would find new friend take place girl may may waiting would find love someone else lived full life intensive purpose good enough closed eye one last time let last breath blink eye woke two tear running face smile still lip fear death know come time know earth given take back life short afraid taking last breath thanks listening ramble

979,A Very Intense Dream,Dreams,"I had a very intense dream last night, and almost questioned if it was a dream at all or maybe something else.

I don't know if this is relevant but let this be prefaced with the fact that I had sleep paralysis twice while falling asleep the night before, and then dreamed someone was dragging me out of bed (woke up screaming).

&#x200B;

Last night, I dreamt i was a child again, in my old neighborhood, but I had all the knowledge I have today. It started with me getting everyones mail, I think my father was a landlord in this dream. I could only open 2 mailboxes, and the rest of the keys were for locks on women's necks (I recognized one of them as my aunt). The lockers were crusted over with blood and dried/dead skin, which makes me think they might've been dead. 

After that I went into my old basement and a woman who looked like she was addicted to heroin or something followed me in and asked if she could take some things. I said yes, when my father came in and asked what I was doing I replied ""I'm in the basement with a junkie."" He went up to her and looked into her eyes and said, ""She's not a junkie, she's a good woman having a bad time."" I started bawling immediately (my family has a history of drug problems). 

Afterwards, I was in my living room having a conversation with an older man I didn't recognize. We were talking about smartphones, and this dream was taking place in the past so I was mindful not to make it clear that I wasn't from there. After a while, I just started singing ""paradox paradox paradox paradox"", when my mother walked in and put an iPhone and the logitech headset I have at home with my [Battle.net](https://Battle.net) Tag on the box. I immediately followed her into the kitchen. I asked her if she knew I was from the future, and she didn't look at me. I told her I just wanted to see my father. She said ""You didn't have to do that."" I started bawling again and told her ""I just want to go home."" over and over again. I curled up in a ball on the floor crying and closed my eyes, and I felt her pushing me back to reality. I was in an empty plane with, strangely enough, runescape monsters and geometry. As I got closer to waking up, I felt a physical sensation like a vacuum sucking my mind back into my physical body, and I woke up screaming next to my girlfriend.

982,Dreaming about a Recently Deceased Friend,Dreams,"Hi everyone! This is my first time posting on here, but I've always been really interested in dreams.

About a month ago someone that I was more acquainted with than a friend died unexpectedly and so young. We talked in passing a few times last semester and I always thought he was interesting, but never saw him again on campus (I go a university with 30,00+ students). I heard that someone had died the first week of classes, however I didn't find out it was him for three more weeks. Although he was not a close friend, his death has made me reflect on life in general a lot more and usual realization stuff like that. Other than grandparents, his death has been only one to ever hit close to home.

Now for the dream. I was in a room alone with the only light being dim sunlight coming through window shears. There was a table in the middle of the room and very clearly had a body under a white sheet on the top. I somehow knew that it was him, but did not feel scared. I remember feeling like I was in the room for hours upon hours and there was no noise at all. Eventually I went over to the table and lifted the sheet back and saw the look of death on his face, but again did not feel scared. It kind of felt like a David Lynch scene lol. Anyway, I sat in a chair in the corner of the room and just stared at the table. A few other people came in the room eventually (I have no clue who they were) and we all stared intently at his sheet covered body. I remember seeing the sheet moving up and down suddenly and then someone going over and removing the cover. I walked over and realized that he was breathing and alive. I had a notion that everyone's love and energy brought him back. He opened his eyes and without saying a word, left the room and acted as if everything was normal. The rest of the dream was me interacting with my neighbors and friends trying to find out where he had gone, as I had not seen him again after he left the room. I wish I could remember more.

I am used to extremely vivid dreams, however this one just really freaked me out after I woke up. Perhaps I'm just having a difficult time coping with his death, but I've never dreamt about him before. Does anyone have thoughts on interpretation?

984,I gave myself closure in a dream over something that has been upsetting me for 5 years,Dreams,"Okay so when I was a little younger, around 17 or so I met this guy and he was essentially my first love. He was a POS though and strung me along for years. He did some pretty messed up shit that should’ve been huge red flags but of course I was totally head over heels for him. I eventually stopped talking to him for good two years ago when I met my bf.

But every now and again I’ll have a dream about him and for a few days all my old feelings about the situation get washed up to the surface. Like it will have me totally distraught the day after I have one. I know that sounds dramatic but that’s how deeply the whole situation affected me. 

I had one of these dreams about him a couple of months ago and this happened. In the dream I was just kind of throwing myself at him and he was blatantly ignoring and rejecting me. Which was a pretty obvious reflection of how I felt rejected by him. This upset me for about a week and then I got over it. 

Then the other night I had another dream about him. He invited me over to his house where he lives with his current gf. He wanted to talk as friends. When I got there we talked. And even though there was some sexual tension/awkwardness between us we pushed on. He told me “that I was perfect but the timing for us to be together just wasn’t right.” I agreed with him and he told me he wanted to stay friends with me because he really liked me as a person. Then his gf made us all dinner and we ate together. I actually thought she was really cool and liked talking to her a lot too. 

When I woke up from this dream I wasn’t sad at all. I felt really good about it and what we talked about. I feel like my subconscious gave me closure on this since I know I’ll never have it irl. It honestly makes me really happy to think about because this is something that hindered me for years in my Romantic relationships. I would also get so mad at myself for still getting upset over how things ended with a shitty guy when I’m with the love of my life who treats me so good. 

Hopefully it stays this way but I truly do finally feel at peace over it. Like I can just close that chapter for good and move on from it completely. It’s a total breathe of fresh air and relief.",0,gave closure dream something upsetting year okay little younger around met guy essentially first love po though strung along year pretty messed shit huge red flag course totally head heel eventually stopped talking good two year ago met bf every dream day old feeling situation get washed surface like totally distraught day one know sound dramatic deeply whole situation affected one dream couple month ago happened dream kind throwing blatantly ignoring rejecting pretty obvious reflection felt rejected upset week got night another dream invited house life current gf wanted talk friend got talked even though sexual tension awkwardness u pushed told perfect timing u together right agreed told wanted stay friend really liked person gf made u dinner ate together actually thought really cool liked talking lot woke dream sad felt really good talked feel like subconscious gave closure since know never irl honestly make really happy think something hindered year romantic relationship would also get mad still getting upset thing ended shitty guy love life treat good hopefully stay way truly finally feel peace like close chapter good move completely total breathe fresh air relief

986,White Rabbit,Dreams,"Hello all.  I am a vivid dreamer who has had lucid dreams, recurring dreams, dreams where the guy in the black hooded cloak with no face was at the end of my bed even though I woke up, etc.  I am pretty good at understanding what they mean.  I am pretty spiritual as well, and can decipher between what is spiritually related and what is from my subconscious...if that makes any sense.

Last night I had a very vivid dream of being in a pet store, just looking around.  Next thing I know, a white rabbit has hopped over to me and is nipping my ankles.  I pick it up and it snuggles into me and I remember holding it and petting it the entire time.  It felt more than just a pet and that it was meant to be with me and my family.  I told my husband to look into its care and he said we can get it.  I said “But it’s so much work” and was concerned I’d be the only one caring for it.  However, I felt a deep connection to this rabbit.  Then I woke up without knowing what happened. 

Any insight into this?  I’m kind of at a loss and all information is greatly appreciated.

993,Dreams about a Lost Friendship.,Dreams,"A little over a year ago, my relationship with a good friend completely broke off. I was absolutely distraught because there was nothing I could have done to prevent this other than allowing her to gaslight me and keep apologizing for things I didn’t do/didn’t remember doing. We had been friends for about 4 years, were writing a book together, and we became roommates our second semester in college. She decided that didn’t work for her. I was hurt, but I tried to keep our relationship going. Well, a lot of stuff happened, I’ll just leave it at that. 

Over the summer, she ended up asking basically for full rights to the book we had been writing together for four years. She wanted to offer me 20% of the profits. We ended up never talking about it because I still wanted to write and she clearly didn’t want me to. We were going to work it out, but we just never talked with each other to do so. I didn’t see her that next year at college either, but I had constant dreams about her. Us yelling at each other, becoming friends again, me trying and failing to work things out. Anything that was a scenario that could happen but just never ended in closure. I always felt horrible waking up.

I saw her on campus again a couple weeks ago and my heart stopped. We passed each other. We didn’t say a word. I’ve been avoiding that path ever since. I saw her again one other time, completely skirted around her to avoid interaction. Maybe I’m a coward. I don’t know. I’d been trying not to let any old feelings come back. Until last night.

Last night I had a dream. She called me up around 1 am (I still have her in my phone so this isn’t necessarily unrealistic.) She told me she needed help. I got up out of bed, got dressed, and drove an hour to get her and take her back to my house. The car ride was silent other than her asking me not to take her home. My family wasn’t home (I don’t know why since it was like 2 am but hey it’s a dream so whatever.)

So I took her up to my room and she just starts bawling. She’d been having issues at home and she was just distraught over it. I tried to comfort her as best I could while still keeping my distance. When she calmed down (it was about 3:30 am in my dream at this point), she asked if we could get together again to work on the book. I wanted to. I love that book. But I said no. She instantly got angry and started yelling at me. Why not? Why wouldn’t I do it? 

I explained that I was still hurt. I didn’t understand why she didn’t want me writing in the first place. Sure, I had schedule conflicts. I had a job and she didn’t, that’s her choice. I needed a job but that didn’t mean I was going to not have one just because the book *might become popular. Even if it did, it wouldn’t give me money immediately. She felt that I needed to get over it. I explained it wasn’t just that. It was how she treated me. Making me think I did things I didn’t remember doing (this has never happened around anyone else, but I still believed her). Telling me I would get irrationally angry and try to hurt her, threaten her and myself, and just do things I didn’t remember at all. But hey, she was my friend. She wouldn’t lie. Well in my dream, I was explaining that I couldn’t get over that. I couldn’t just... forget.  

So then she starts bringing up more things that I did wrong. Again, I didn’t remember any of it. Like going through her clothes or stealing her stuff, etc, etc. In real life, she’d never actually accused me of these things, but dream her was just going off on me. At this point, we’re just screaming at each other. Then, my parents got home (they were the ones that convinced me to maybe not believe her in the first place), and she just starts sobbing again. Running over to me and hugging me. Trying to make the situation look like she didn’t mean it, she’s just upset. I tried comforting her again, but I just felt so... lost.

This is the most vivid dream I’ve had of seeing her again. At that point I woke up. On one hand, I feel a little more closure over saying no to her. Explaining why I wouldn’t continue on as friends, etc. On the other hand, I can tell I’m still hurt. I didn’t hesitate to go get her, nor did I hesitate to comfort her, even after we’d been screaming at each other. I just don’t know how to feel about this dream. It was just... strange.

994,"Tooth (just one) falling out, scared when woke up",Dreams,"Hi everyone... This dream I had last night and I’m having some trouble remembering all the details, but here’s the gist. If anyone has any ideas at all for interpretation, I’d greatly appreciate them.

I’m at some office building. One of my teeth (just one) falls out—or, more accurately, I pull it out by accident while trying to feel it because I had a toothache there. I wrap the tooth up in some cloth that gets soaked with blood, and the tooth has blood on it too. But no blood is in my mouth (which even in the dream I found odd).

For some reason I go to a pediatric dentist (I think he was nearest). This is a short older man with grayish hair and maybe glasses. Nothing like my own dentist (a young woman), I should note. He tells me not to worry and keeps me waiting for a long time. I’m wondering if he can just put the tooth back into the socket and everything will be OK. Eventually he tells told me to lie down on an operating table. I keep thinking I have some rare disease.

Then I woke up, at about 2 in the morning, frantically checking my teeth to see if they were all still there. Despite that, I wasn’t actually “scared” in-dream; I only freaked out when I woke up.",0,tooth one falling scared woke hi everyone dream last night trouble remembering detail gist anyone idea interpretation greatly appreciate office building one teeth one fall accurately pull accident trying feel toothache wrap tooth cloth get soaked blood tooth blood blood mouth even dream found odd reason go pediatric dentist think nearest short older man grayish hair maybe glass nothing like dentist young woman note tell worry keep waiting long time wondering put tooth back socket everything ok eventually tell told lie operating table keep thinking rare disease woke morning frantically checking teeth see still despite actually scared dream freaked woke
995,"Four ways, murder, and demons oh my!",Dreams,"So there was this girl named Angela and this guy named Tony and then a guy I actually know in real life named Garrett and basically we were all four in a relationship together. Then something weird and supernatural happened at school to Angela and she died and it was very traumatic. (And also turned into a trash can briefly? Dreams are weird)

Tony then jumped from a building but I didn't believe it was suicide because he still had me and Garrett so why would we do that? So I quit school because I believed something was going on there because suddenly other people started dying too. 

Then my friend Holly quit too and tried to drive us home but we were being chased by what I can only describe as undead demon things. I got the hand of one broken off and brought it to the church I grew up going to where it burned up.

998,Hurting loved ones,schizophrenia,"korba went insane for about a month. big surprise. but during this time he was a complete asshole to his SO and dumped her and got back together, just to dump her again.

korba's mind understood that she's not who she pretends to be and has really dark intentions towards him. he knew he used to have such delusions, but this time they took complete control.

now korba is left with a pretty broken relationship, not knowing how to fix things. maybe it's better to end it once and for all, just to avoid more hurt down the road. but korba loves her, so while he's not convinced that she's the devil, he wants to be with her more than anything in life.

Ive tried different things like a book with short stories so if i do t read for a while i can pick it up again and start in a new story and not get annoyed about what the book was about. But even then its difficult. After years of netflix i need the visual stimulation i guess. 
So i got the next best thing. Comic books (batman to be specific) ive grown out of comic books when i was about 10-11 (asterix and disney comics) but after joker i found an interesting character and decided to give that a go. 
Its pretty easy. Its still “reading” but also having visuals so i dont get bored reading descriptions of rooms and people.

1011,Could your hallucinations actually help you perceive the world around you better?,schizophrenia,"Hey guys, so my boyfriend has sz and when we started going out I remember one of the first things I noticed about him was his ease at understanding people and reading them.

Fast forward to a month or so after we were going out, he once asked me if I had slept with this common friend of ours. I was so surprised by the question because there was no way he could've known about it. And he told me just figured out by the way we act together, which was strange, because I really think we act more or less the same as before, and even if we acted slightly different it was not enough info as to jump to the conclusion that we had slept together.

Fast forward some months again, after he told me he had sz, he told me that it was not him who found out I had slept with our common friend, that it was somebody else telling him (not irl, in his mind). 

So my question is, do hallucinations and voices ever ""help"" you reading other people and just be more perceptive about the world around you? Or is just bad stuff overall?

Much of the reason why I want to is because I’m about 15 lbs overweight and about 25 lbs away from where I’d like to be and accomplishing that has become far more important to me than drinking alcohol.  I can maintain my weight while drinking but I cannot lose weight and that is more important.

1024,(Ah shit) Here we go again!,schizophrenia,"YES!

I (tbh) I even waited for it. What I mean is that it got normal for me to see things like heads where others saw nothing. My brain gave me a break for about 3 weeks now and it began again! I'm siting here on my Desktop, parents sleeping, it's 2 am and i can't sleep cuz that girl and the heads are watching me. I LOVE IT. Who wouldn't love the thougts of some one murdering u in a couple of seconds or someone standing right behind u, a knife in his hands about to murder u.

To calm down I even put the lights on.

Just because I want to relax a little bit I am going to talk about them here:        (as if u wouldn't already know ;)    )

\- The Girl:            She is watching me most of the time at night or when I am sleeping. She even looks like the Horror Movie Stereotype Girl. Her hair in front of her face so I can't see it. White dress and jsut standing in corners most of the time.

The ""faces"":        Some Abstract faces I see in ""flashbacks"" or i would call them ""flashmemories"". Some memories of another world, memories that aren't mine.

\- The Man:       He (that creepy asshole) is always standing behind me. FUCKING ALWAYS MAN! He even follows me in my Dreams. He counts as one of the Shadows but he is somehow a guy that never changes his look.

\- The Shadows: The Shadows are something like an own race and they are always different in shape except for ""The man"" I mentioned before. Those bitches are watching me very often. Some of them got a BIG smile (Horror Stereotype like)

\- The Eyes of the walls: I don't see these eyes very often but if I do It creeps the sh\*t out of me.

&#x200B;

My thoughts aren't even mine someone is controlling them BUT sometimes my own thoughts leak through... So ""I"" don't only think that I should kill myself or punch my self as hard as I can.

Random things I noticed:           -Aggression -Depression -Self-Harming -Panic Attacks -Nervous Behaviour -Not able to calm down -Insomnia

1044,So I'm switching from seroquel to abilify,schizophrenia,"As per title. 

I'm switching from seroquel to abilify as part of a research study, the study in question is basically about sexual activity and antipsychotics.

I've been on seroquel around 2 years now I think, and I was taking 1 300mg in the morning and 1 in the evening. It basically knocked me out so they switched me to 1 XL slow release seroquel. 

I've tapered down to 150mg a day and I feel much better fatigue wise but the nightmares and shadows are back. 

Reason for my post is basically to see how people find/found abilify. It's apparently pretty good for weight control and sex life compared to what I'm on at the moment, but I just wanna from you guys how you found it? 

I'm pretty nervous about the switch as some of my symptoms are creeping back, but god knows I'd like to lose some weight (I'm not that big as I'm 6'1 and I carry it well, plus i workout so that helps somewhat) and actually enjoy sex again, maybe even look forward to getting out of bed.

Let me preface this by saying I do not have schizophrenia. I recently watched the show Undone and was really curious what you guys thought about it. I thought it was so beautiful and sort of devastating, but of course I can't speak to its accuracy. 

another thing was that I interpreted it as a story through the eyes of someone developing schizophrenia, but i saw an interview with the writer and it seems she is really going the route of ""mental illness opens you up to supernatural things"". I have to say I felt a bit disappointed by this. I actually wondered if that might be a somewhat sketchy message, given that i've read that those with schizophrenia can have trouble distinguishing what's real or not, and perhaps seeing a show that could reinforce a delusion would be a setback. I'd love to hear your thoughts. i've never gotten the chance to fully learn about mental disorders so some of this might be completely ignorant in which case please let me know!",1,thought amazon prime show undone super spoiler want take chance seen want go show blind read post let preface saying schizophrenia recently watched show undone really curious guy thought thought beautiful sort devastating course speak accuracy another thing interpreted story eye someone developing schizophrenia saw interview writer seems really going route mental illness open supernatural thing say felt bit disappointed actually wondered might somewhat sketchy message given read schizophrenia trouble distinguishing real perhaps seeing show could reinforce delusion would setback love hear thought never gotten chance fully learn mental disorder might completely ignorant case please let know

1065,I feel unsure and like I'm making things up,schizophrenia,"I have just now began to entertain the idea of possibly having psychosis/ schizophrenia. But I feel like since I have a lot of insight and my hallucinations and few and far between, that I'm making it all up?

Like, maybe I just want attention or to have a ""real"" diagnosis (I currently am in the hospital for depression, and have been since March. Which feels like a ""not-real"" diagnosis because it's not able to be seen.)

A couple of years ago I believed there were shadow people following me, and I didn't leave my house until I was forced to by my mom, and came back home when she recognized I was having a breakdown. I didn't tell anyone about the shadow people, and ripped up and destroyed the drawings and writing I made about all that. Because I think I made it up for attention or something? Maybe to make myself feel better or special? I also can't remember this time very well.

And sometimes I hear voices, like people talking in a diner, or someone calling my name. Usually when it's quiet. I feel like my brain is just trying to fill the silence though. And I recognize that it's not real. And it doesn't happen super often.

I also have periods of time that I believe I'm in hell/purgatory. Or that I'm the only real person, or this is all a simulation or something. But most of the time I only kind of entertain the idea, I rarely- if ever- believe it fully. Just kind of.

Writing all this down, I honest to god think I'm doing this for attention or to have a real diagnosis. Maybe none of this is real. Maybe I'm doing this because my family might take me seriously now? I don't know.

I **will** tell my doctor, and I brought up a very little portion of this to my therapist, but I want to know what you guys think? And please, please consider that I'm lying or something. Or making it up. Not maliciously, but I really can't believe that this is real. I don't fucking know.

1067,"I'm planning on slowly reducing my medication to zero. How many of you live med free, and can anyone offer advice for doing so?",schizophrenia,"Before anyone jumps on me about how somehow just because I'm schizophrenic means my brain ""requires"" antipsychotics for the rest of my life to function, you probably shouldn't because it is likely that I understand the psychopharmacology better than you. I have developed an uncommon (but not super uncommon) iatrogenic reaction to anti-psychotics that means in the people that have this syndrome, anti-psychotics worsen psychosis long-term. I can explain the science for anyone interested, but my doctor and I have been working on going down for a while, so it is not like I'm just impulsively ""going off my meds""—I am doing this with the support and guidance of a physician and we are going down slowly and safely.

I think if I can get over my brain's dependency on anti-psychotics after taking them for 5+ years, I will have a great level of functioning because even before I ever took medication, I was actually functioning better despite the psychosis problems, but I feel now I have the psychotherapeutic tools to manage psychosis if it comes up without medication. Antipsychotic withdrawal, from what I've experienced, is brutal. But my doctor is going to add a mood stabilizer, which can alleviate the symptoms of anti-psychotic withdrawal. I will probably stay on the mood stabilizer for at least 6 months after the antipsychotic is at 0 to ensure I don't suffer rebound psychosis from the withdrawal.

There has been a lot of research to show that schizophrenics have higher long-term recovery rates with no to minimal medication. I think that is true. What do you guys recommend for managing symptoms that may come up during withdrawal or throughout my life off meds? Has anyone here done this before?

And the last time I posted something like this I got downvoted and no responses, so I want to affirm that I am absolutely not against medication; I just don't benefit from medication because of this uncommon iatrogenic syndrome. I support those of you who wish to remain on medication for life.

After a few days have passed I should text her and say hey babe how are you feeling? can you talk?

1073,I'm regularly thinking about not medicating,schizophrenia,"Before I went for help about my voices I was a very dedicated Chess player. When I had a conversation I used to map out common variables of outcome for the conversation. It was easy to write poems and come up with stories. Even though I had seldom inspiration moments because I kept myself drained with cannabis. I have had voices in my head almost all of my childhood and so on. I started having problems because I started to do the observer/observed pychological excercise and started paying attention to those voices. That started with a dellusion that a friend told me that this voices had always been there but I didn't pay attention and thought I should start paying attention. Then I tried mushrrooms and hell broke loose. A whole alternate reality started made up of the ideas running my head recently. I was into gnosticism back then and used to go to a psychic that have me suspicious of his true abilities so he had me interested, studying him.

I've had stopped treatment in 3 occasions with the purpose of boosting creativity and basic analysis. But I had other problems like Daddy issues related to religion. Religion is what got me investigating the occult because I had the thought that darkness was the true source of power which is where God came from, so was curious what kind of findings these occult societies had found. And these problems exploded and also I been disconnected from my regular conversation in spot analysis was adapting to do so again everytime I was off meds. Rages and moods swings like bipolar disorder which were product of my never ending interior dramas. In the end I was taken for treatment against my will in all this events. In the last treatment I fell into apathy real hard and haven't been able to sustain activities, not even gaming. I spent almost a year buying the parts for my PC and it took a toll on me to have such a long process.

I've been thinking again about stopping treatment and right now switching to pills is very convenient because I wouldn't have to deal with long drive and also the cost of paying the doctor. But I fear that I could try to stop again if I go the pill route once more. I really dislike and resent my treatment course because I was treated like I had no say in anything, first off doctors didn't tell me how different I would feel and didn't show any experience with the drug I use. So I'm always thinking I really have depression and should medicate accordingly and this was my first diagnosis. I have never in my life thought this were real voices but instead it was like when someone read and repeats the words in the mind.

That's what I really want, with lithium (I think) the voices where faint and faded with ease, I had all my feelings and wasn't so apathetic. And had no painful feelings and I'm also a ""rare"" schizophrenic says my psychiatrist because I don't advance my illness so that leaves me doubts my diagnosis.",1,regularly thinking medicating went help voice dedicated chess player conversation used map common variable outcome conversation easy write poem come story even though seldom inspiration moment kept drained cannabis voice head almost childhood started problem started observer observed pychological excercise started paying attention voice started dellusion friend told voice always pay attention thought start paying attention tried mushrrooms hell broke loose whole alternate reality started made idea running head recently gnosticism back used go psychic suspicious true ability interested studying stopped treatment occasion purpose boosting creativity basic analysis problem like daddy issue related religion religion got investigating occult thought darkness true source power god came curious kind finding occult society found problem exploded also disconnected regular conversation spot analysis adapting everytime med rage mood swing like bipolar disorder product never ending interior drama end taken treatment event last treatment fell apathy real hard able sustain activity even gaming spent almost year buying part pc took toll long process thinking stopping treatment right switching pill convenient deal long drive also cost paying doctor fear could try stop go pill route really dislike resent treatment course treated like say anything first doctor tell different would feel show experience drug use always thinking really depression medicate accordingly first diagnosis never life thought real voice instead like someone read repeat word mind really want lithium think voice faint faded ease feeling apathetic painful feeling also rare schizophrenic say psychiatrist advance illness leaf doubt diagnosis
1074,Feeling like a 10 year old while experiencing psychosis,schizophrenia,"Has anyone else experienced this? 
I’ve had 2 very intense episodes of psychosis, both times I genuinely felt I was 10 years old. It goes beyond just feeling that age, one of the times, not that long ago, I had to walk down some stairs and there was no handrail and I sat down crying saying I couldn’t go down. I was terrified of going down the stairs with no handrail in that moment. And at 10 years old, I probably would have done the same, but at the age I am now, I can walk down no problem. So obviously I had the thoughts and feelings of a 10 year old as well. The other time I was at my bf house and I told him I had to go home because my dad would be mad that I was out and I was afraid of his dog, (I was afraid of dogs at age 10) even though I spent every day playing with that dog.",1,feeling like year old experiencing psychosis anyone else experienced intense episode psychosis time genuinely felt year old go beyond feeling age one time long ago walk stair handrail sat cry saying go terrified going stair handrail moment year old probably would done age walk problem obviously thought feeling year old well time bf house told go home dad would mad afraid dog afraid dog age even though spent every day playing dog

1083,Needing medication advice. I'm desperate.,schizophrenia,"Hi everyone, this is my first post here, so forgive me if there are any mistakes. I found this subreddit a few months ago, and it's helped me feel like I'm not so alone in this and has given me some understanding of my illness. But now I have a problem and didn't know where else to turn, so I'm hoping some of you can help me out. I was diagnosed at age 17, (9 years ago), and have been on medications intermittently since. As of a few months ago, I made the decision to try it again and was put on Vraylar 1mg, later to be increased to 3mg. At first, things were going well, it gave me energy and took away my visual and auditory hallucinations more than any other medication has before. It even had a positive effect on my paranoia that everyone is out to get me. 

But as the months have gone on, I have become more and more paranoid, severely depressed, and extremely tired all the time (just to name a few). The exhaustion came first, then came the depression. Oh, and my concentration is absolutely awful, to the point that it's become difficult to even count money or change. I can't sit still long enough to read a book, nor can I retain any of the information I just read. It's become infuriating and depressing to just get through the day.

So, I have decided that I want to stop taking it. But I'm worried about coming off of it, because of my previous experience of withdrawing off of Geodon. I never want to go through that again. But I can't keep going on like this. I'm not even sure if I want to switch to another medication, considering my last interaction with my doctor. She humiliated me in front of the whole staff and patients in the waiting area all due to their appointment scheduling mistake. But that isn't important right now. 

If any of you have been on Vraylar or have any suggestions or advice as to what I should do, then please let me know. I don't want to be on this medication any longer, and you guys are the only ones who I feel can understand what I'm going through.

I haven't talked to my therapist or loved ones about it because in the past couple of years I've become really attatched to some of these ""people"" and I don't know if I want to get rid of them.

I'm only typing this because I've upped my medication and I don't know what's real and what isn't. They *seem* so real to me but at the same time I know it can't be possible.

Of course my socal media feeds were filled with people disclosing about anxiety, depression, cptsd, and some bipolar dxs. When I didn't share anything I was accused privately of this refusal being the result of internalized stigma, and contributing to wider societal stigma. I don't exactly feel that I owe anyone any explanations, and I'm not required to educate anyone about my life and my diagnosis. But I'm stuck on these comments. Maybe to some degree this is about internalized stigma, I am still coming to terms with my diagnosis -- although I'm getting there. To some degree this is certainly fear of stigma and the potential real world repercussions of other people finding out my dx. But to what degree am I contributing to wider societal stigma by not being more open about my diagnosis? If everyone remains silent it's impossible to try to overcome this stigma. And it makes it that much harder for others to be open about their diagnoses. And now I feel like a bad person for failing to stand up and be more open about this.

1100,Struggling with being honest with my family about my symptoms because someone who was completely evil and also happened to have a history of schizophrenia stabbed my cousins grandmother. Sorry for long post.,schizophrenia,"So, a few days ago, my cousins grandmother got stabbed 15 times by a family friend whom she has known a long time, who we didn't know was a complete psychopath. Yes, she did have schizophrenia too, but she didn't stab her because she had a psychotic break. The police found her diary where she had written down her plans to murder her and her entire family (including all of the kids), so that she could have my uncle Eric all to herself. She also stabbed her while naked, so that she wouldn't have any evidence left on her. It worked too, the only evidence the police have is the diary.  I am sorry, she wasn't mentally ill when she stabbed her. She is evil. She knew what she was doing when she did it,  planned it out, and feels no remorse for wanting, and trying, to kill multiple people. 

My cousins are of course all reeling from this, and I feel so terrible for the pain their family is going through right now. Luckily, she survived and is in the ICU recovering. 

I am worried, that if my cousins ever find out that I am being evaluated for schizo spectrum disorders (which I most likely have), that they will think that I am the same as her, and view me as an evil monster too. I love my family very much, and I don't want them to be afraid of me. 

I am further worried, because the major delusion that I used to struggle with is that I am a psychopath who will inevitably kill people. I am worried that this will trigger that delusion to return. 

My cousin wants to talk to me, and ask about how my symptoms are doing. We initially thought that what I was suffering from was neuro in origin, but now are suspecting it is mental illness. He had heard that I had been hospitalized back in April for pseudo seizures, and so that is what he is asking about. What should I tell him? It seems like a terrible time to be honest about how I am actually doing. My mom is encouraging me to not say anything about my struggles.

1101,Cousin began having extreme delusions out of nowhere. Had to commit her to the ward for a week and the antipsychotics have her essentially paralyzed.,schizophrenia,"My cousin 20F, whom I'm very close to, just had a psychotic break out of nowhere. Her previous mental health history is mostly just anxiety and depression. We had to check her into the hospital, but as expected they put her on Seroquel until she was a zombie, but still equally delusional, and then switched her to invega 6mg and discharged her (I'm guessing they were over dealing with it). 
Ever since she's been completely frozen, ridged, eyes rolled up at the ceiling, repeating the same 3 things. ""I am god"" ""this is stupid"" ""I understand"". She's also been throwing up and I don't think she's slept more than 5 hours total in the last two weeks. Despite my study in this field and experience with psychosis, this is still horrible to watch. Am I crazy or does this mean that antipsychotics are clearly NOT working? 

I suffered psychosis with delusions a few years ago, not as severe, but antipsychotics made everything way worse, mirtazipine and Valium ultimately helped me. 

I know antipsychotics have lasting effects and if she is responding this way can this permanently damage her?

We have no idea what to do, because these psych wards are literally shit and they just drug up all of their patients until they're barely conscious enough to function and then discharge them to get rid of them.  There doesn't seem to be a good place that will take her and monitor her enough to realize the antipsychotics aren't working.

Also were unsure if this is a schizophrenia showing up, or a psychotic break from smoking a lot of weed with a history of mental health issues. Her and I are both the same as in if we smoke we have panic attacks but she would all of the time regardless and I know habitual use can cause this.

Does anyone have any insight or experience with this at all? Anything similar?

I wa wondering if any of you have voices like these. They even say theyr real people but they live inside of me. They told me inside my mind is a black void where they can mak shapes and catch nerve spikes or something. I asked them if they remember being born they said no. They said there may be a phase after they become ""real"" where they forget stuff from when they were basic people. 

They said there a place called naan or caan that is similar to what we call heaven. They also said that when we die we enter a white room wher we get interviwed. They say they work things out by thinking since thats all they can do inside of us. They said that they used to make me angry so i would kill someone or die so they can be free.

1117,Moving back into the group home,schizophrenia,"In 2017 I stayed at a group home called Soteria for six months. Soteria is modeled after a program started in California in the 70s by Loren Mosher - it's medication-neutral (not encouraging anybody to take meds if they don't want to and investing in alternative therapies like massage, group discussion, art, peer support, and meditation - although you can certainly take meds if you so choose) and most of the staff are peers in that they've experienced mental illness in their lifetime. Some have schizophrenia. The original Soteria is now defunct due to lack of funding, but there are Soterias all over the world modeled after it. There is currently only one in the United States - the one I'm going to - in Burlington Vermont.

Now I'm going back! I just got the news yesterday that I'd been accepted back into the program. I'll probably be there for 3 or 4 months. 

I'm on Abilify 30mg and Invega Sustenna 234mg (both max doses) and I do plan to keep taking my meds, although my doctor and I have planned to discuss reducing my dosage of Abilify at my next appointment on Wednesday. 

I'm really excited to be moving in. I'm not REALLY an ideal candidate for the program since it's really intended for people experiencing their first bout of psychosis and who are medication-naive, while I've been sick for two and a half years and taking meds almost since the beginning (have been on twelve different antipsychotics in that time). Still, they're letting me back mainly as a way to increase my connection to community, since my psychiatrist has identified isolation as the primary factor in my repeated pattern of hospitalization, discharge, increased symptoms, hospitalization again. I live in a studio apartment and see nobody other than my parents once a week, my case manager once a week, and my psychiatrist once a week. I don't go outside except on Wednesday mornings to walk to the clinic.

1124,How I cured my positive symptoms.,schizophrenia,"A little introduction and disclaimer is needed for this. I was diagnosed 10 years ago at age 19. Been on a wide range of anti psychotics many with detrimental effects nearly costing me my life. I have been symptom free for 2 years and now to a certain degree negative symptom as well. What I did worked for me and may not work for you and there are risks involved in doing what im doing. I began taking etizolam 3 mg daily 2 years ago. Within a week I no longer had delusions or voices/intruding thoughts. It all went away. Completely. I stayed on my anti psychotic (risperidone) and still am unable to get off it due to rebound psychosis from the withdrawal so I continue to take it. I make sure I have a constant supply of the etizolam as the withdrawal is potentially fatal as it is a thienodiazepam. I wouldn't trade that risk though for being psychotic all the time again as it was a living hell and I was unable to function. 2 years ago I was living at a friends house a total wreck. Now I live on my own, own a car and starting a career in IT. My life is back on track. Yes I have to take the etizolam the rest of my life but there are very few serious long term side effects especially compared to the risperidone I have to take the rest of my life. Anyway I just wanted to share with you all a medication that got my life back on track and saved me from the waking nightmare that is schizophrenia. Not saying it will work for you but I thought Id share it as it was a turning point for me in dealing with this illness. im happy to answer any questions if any of you are interested.",1,cured positive symptom little introduction disclaimer needed diagnosed year ago age wide range anti psychotic many detrimental effect nearly costing life symptom free year certain degree negative symptom well worked may work risk involved im began taking etizolam mg daily year ago within week longer delusion voice intruding thought went away completely stayed anti psychotic risperidone still unable get due rebound psychosis withdrawal continue take make sure constant supply etizolam withdrawal potentially fatal thienodiazepam trade risk though psychotic time living hell unable function year ago living friend house total wreck live car starting career life back track yes take etizolam rest life serious long term side effect especially compared risperidone take rest life anyway wanted share medication got life back track saved waking nightmare schizophrenia saying work thought id share turning point dealing illness im happy answer question interested

1128,I'm going to apply for a job as a peer counselor at an early psychosis clinic.

When I go back to school in the spring, I am switching my major to psychology because I want to be a therapist, hopefully working in a clinic with people with bipolar or schizophrenia.

I think doing this while I go to school will look really good for graduate school. And then after grad school, I'm going to train for four years at the CG Jung Institute in San Francisco to get certified as a Jungian analyst because that's the modality of therapy I want to practice and what I have found most helpful for my own recovery, owing to my sense of spirituality.

1130,House of cards.,schizophrenia,"Delusions build off of each other like a house of cards.  This is both good and bad.  It's good because you can bring it down by targetting the deepest foundational delusions but it's bad because you can pick up the cards and rebuild.

In my experience the house of cards can remain intact after being medicated.  Delusions persist even when on meds.  So the struggle of overcoming them has to come from within and this is where the challenge lies.  It takes conscious effort.

For starters, anyone who wants to dismantle the house of cards should work from the top down and not make the whole thing collapse because that is a great way to have an existential crisis.  What this means practically is that you don't have to immediately go and say everything I believe is a lie and have your worldview come crashing down.  You don't even need to accept you have delusions at first but you should make a conscious effort to give them less power over your life.  

Example time...

When I was suffering psychotic episodes I frequently thought that there was a game being played and I was one of the players.  I called it the devils game because I thought I was playing against the devil.  In the hospital I made a conscious effort to get better and one thing I did that was a milestone in the recovery was to stop playing the game.  Not stop believing the game exists but within the context of that delusion, giving it less power over my life.  So the house of cards was intact from the bottom up since I was still believing in the game but I took the card that represents my belief in playing the game away and it made me feel less distressed.  Once you get one card down it becomes easier to get another one down and slowly but surely the house of cards will be dismantled.",1,house card delusion build like house card good bad good bring targetting deepest foundational delusion bad pick card rebuild experience house card remain intact medicated delusion persist even med struggle overcoming come within challenge lie take conscious effort starter anyone want dismantle house card work top make whole thing collapse great way existential crisis mean practically immediately go say everything believe lie worldview come crashing even need accept delusion first make conscious effort give le power life example time suffering psychotic episode frequently thought game played one player called devil game thought playing devil hospital made conscious effort get better one thing milestone recovery stop playing game stop believing game exists within context delusion giving le power life house card intact bottom since still believing game took card represents belief playing game away made feel le distressed get one card becomes easier get another one slowly surely house card dismantled
1131,The psychoanalysis of a teen turned youth and his problem with porn and his emerged schizophrenia from this porn. And the cultural tradition of india,schizophrenia,"Today I have decided to quit porn forever , i.e , 11th of October, for my own good health ,both mental and physical. I have been trying to quit for past few days very seriously but the gravity and longevity of my addiction holds much more than its levity and evanescence. For I know that it's nothing compared to what I can achieve in my real life but the allure of porn always push me toward it for it being easily accessible and my past experience of abstaining from it causing schizophrenia which I will elaborate later. I have been watch porn regularly after I had relapsed one year back on 23rd of April which was a consequence of my mental health deterioration and I was taken to a hospital for my mental check up. There I had the voices in my head telling me that all the nurses and doctors are trying to seduce me in my thought and that was the urge that I gave into which made my addiction to reemerge and that would take another 2 year for me to decide not to watch it again today and by writing it in my phone made me look like more serious of giving upto these urges. 
I have written down my secrets that a few know and those secrets are not known to a single person. It's like opening your inner self to one person , and then opening your much darker secret to somebody else. The person I most believe in is my friend who I know would abandon me whenever he is put to test. Maybe that assumptions is for myself as I am known to abandon friends and acquaintances whenever they are in need of. I have always believed myself to be hard willed , sharp in mind , and to leave anything which I found to be not much worthy of my respect and time  . But I have turned out to be wrong . I will lead from now with a story that you may find intriguing. Maybe my lack of word power in English can make me incompetent of telling my story in a more comprehensive manner but nevertheless I will proceed:-
There was a time when I was young and restless. I had all the desire of being successful and to have the knowledge of the world . And for that I started to read everything that would come up to me even the match sticks. I found reading to be much more valuable than anything else even the family . This was the time when I was around 12. I had not explored the world , even now I haven't but with the technology in my hand now I am trying to garner as much knowledge as I can then to try to pass it to others about how the exploitative mindset of our own leaders, you can also call them guide if you are on that side of spectrum where you conform to every single things that's mainstream, leads us to our own destruction, morally and ethically , like sleeping with girls and exploiting them as done by our own Mahatma Gandhi , even though I haven't read his autobiography , I can tell that from what I have heard of his writing about his sexual deviation and his desire to check this by sleeping with two teenage girls , which made our society so downgraded that I feel shame whenever I walk on this wretched land of mine , i.e India. For you may have heard of India and it's view of sex as a taboo to be discussed in open. It is the thing people take pleasure from in night but in day it's like there's nothing called sex and there is so much shame running around in this country about sex that I would suspect even the most progressive of writers like Nivedita Menon take upon herself to break the taboo around it. I , therefore , respect a much better writer , i.e Arundhati Roy , who is far more open about taking up issues like this to bring it in open. I guess this would have to do with their differentt backgrounds and both being from a Brahman family, I guess that would have to do with their experiences with it , one conforming to norms and other breaking it. Befor I proceed to my story I have a story to tell of this two writers which I have made up in mind .
Suppose there are two girls from same family, a lower caste shudra family. One who is far more expressive than her sister. And other is just going with the flow but within her harbouring a much more rebel nature in her to revolt against anything that comes up her way. One is against a one section of inequality and other against the whole system. Whom would you support ?Let me help you by giving you some more example . One has watched her mother , her sister , other women being oppressedby their male counterparts , not just their counterparts , they are being ‘oppressed’ by their own children that is male . And the other one who has watched the suffering of both and much more the sexual exploitation of girls and boys alike , one boy might be her brother, and both have spoken openly about this when they got to know the nature of the suppression , it’s effect on the mental health and their physical stuntness which has caused to behave more like an insane person . Whom would you support? For me I have chosen the latter one to be my guide because in this epoch of India , i.e 2019, I believe that suppression happened on both side , maybe one has material gains which can be obtained from oppression but the other has spiritual gain which can be only obtained through suppression of other's feelings because they have been devoided of the material gain. It is my opinion only . I don't think of you conforming to my illusion but nevertheless I will proceed .  The fact that one has been spiritually suppressed can be best understood as the number of intellectuals that are really intellectuals being women . And the number of materialist who are men. From this perspective I have gained insight on the spiritual nature and material nature. Now with two girls . One who is wholly for the spiritual gains decided to point out the material inequalities that have been bequeathed on women , because gaining spirituality has become her nature , her intrinsic one as is embedded in her through long years of oppression of her kind . And the brother I talked about totally in for the material gains decided to point out the spiritual incapability of his only to gain more material as has become his intrinsic nature . But one who has found a silver lining between these two and set out a path for herself , for she is the seeker of truth , decided to point out the system and in every circumstances giving a hand to oppressed or suppressed like his brother and sister who have taken the path of their destiny without ever questioning it. I have not specified upon the brother because I don't find myself gaining control over material thing , for I know spirituality preceds materialism .if you have been spiritual enough then you might not need look for the material. But for surviving material is also necessary which I think have been forgotten by the oppressed section that have come to their mind rather late.But the economy is run by materialist which I think have been so suppressed that they might have took a dive in the darker areas of human nature which is what ruining us or might be making more knowledgeable about our dark ambitions. That's why I am going to be focused on the two sisters. For it is a positive article which I have written for myself to make me come out of the dark. Now the two girls I am talking about are Nivedita Menon and Arundhati Roy both excellent in their own domain. But I guess I would rather walk a silver lining than to go treading on the positive area because for me I can't even I try to because I have spent so much time in the negative areas,i.e materialistic in nature , that it might not be possible to me walk on that positive area because there is also suffering and pain. Pain adjoines everyone irrespective of what they might be doing , even a sleep can cause pain , a pain of time lost. Therefore it is imperative to me to first find a silver lining at which I can cling my faith onto because it's the only place that one can keep an eye on and stretch their hands for because on the both negative and positive areas there is not much to hold onto. One's a deep sea where you have to dive in without putting a oxygen mask on waiting for to last your breath but if you have that insight that you can't go further you hope for the surface and that is what for me is a silver lining. And the other one is the sky where you have not yet learnt to fly but will only hope so when you are at the surface . So for me this silver lining is important . For this silver lining will open the scope for my further growth. I have desire of leaving the silver lining as soon as I reach there but in the contrary I have the desire of going every length of that silver lining and explore it then learn to fly . For me that brother is deep into the sea and yet he is the king of the underworld he can negotiate with the queen of the sky to give him passes which can make him fly for a brief period of time and he can in return help her elder sister dive into sea and explore it for a short period. But the one who is at the silver lining has to suffer her for eternity even though there is no suffering here but we can never know what suffering means to someone who has not experienced any suffering . For her it might be the suffering of not feeling suffering. There's another girl , who is the 3rd sister , on the silver lining which work cooperatively with her at the other end in holding the line. Both have come from different area of experience , one has the experience of sea and one has the experience of sky but they decided to not go further and settle down at the surface and help the people coming from death or life to go into the other world.i have only decided to make the two girls my main character because they are much loved by the so called intellectuals who wants to fly into the sky but to also know the little secrets about the sea .

1134,This is the first time I can say I'm genuinely suicidal & I don't know how to tell my doctor,schizophrenia,"Difficult post to make. I'll try keep it to the point. I'm very tired. It's been 2 months now where I feel so uncomfortable leaving the house. People talk about me, make fun of me, laugh at me. I've been forcing myself out of the house everyday and it still happens. I realise it's probably voices but it's so real.

My psychiatrist wants me to go on Clozapine.

I've noticed my mood getting lower and lower while I've tried to keep it together. But all I can think about is doing what the voices say. I've thought about the ways I would do it. It's stuck in my head on a loop. Constant images of what would happen during and the aftermath.

I don't know what to do. I've started cleaning my room just incase so my mam doesn't have to go through that. I feel so much guilt. I feel incredibly selfish that I'm even thinking about this. But I don't see a way out. Either I stay on my meds and have the whole world laugh at me or I go on the last resort medication & suffer the consequences of that.

I just want someone to help me but I don't know what help I need. I wish I didn't have this illness. I can't deal with it anymore and I can no longer see a future for myself.

Since I go to a clinic my doctors change fairly frequently. I have had like 5 different doctors over the past 4 years. Anyway, I realized with one in particular that she would never participate in the conversation, no matter what I brought up I could feel her trying to dissect what I was saying. It didn't matter if I was bringing up my change of employment or how my classes were going she would always respond in one of two ways. either audibly ""hmmming"" to acknowledge she heard me or responding with ""and how does that make you feel?"" For the longest time I couldn't figure out why it bothered me then when I was talking with my current doctor I realized as I said that I didn't get along that well with this past doctor, in particular, because I felt that no matter what I brought up she was searching everything I said  for a hint of psychosis.",1,liked past psychiatrist day talking psychiatrist discussing past doctor didnt always get along clarify stable since getting current medication roughly year ago going office every month last year since go clinic doctor change fairly frequently like different doctor past year anyway realized one particular would never participate conversation matter brought could feel trying dissect saying matter bringing change employment class going would always respond one two way either audibly hmmming acknowledge heard responding make feel longest time figure bothered talking current doctor realized said get along well past doctor particular felt matter brought searching everything said hint psychosis
1147,People with Schizophrenia who are currently on anti-psychotic medication: How long did it take for you to overcome negative symptoms and could you think faster when it was over?,schizophrenia,"I think that the anti-psychotic meds have something to do with me not being as fun, witty, full of ideas, great memory, etc. as I used to be. I think it makes me think slower. But then I think that my sickness made me think super fast when I was psychotic and the meds are just evening out how my mind works and gears it down to a level that is at the normal speeds of a normal mind and that would mean that after my negative symptoms are over with (my health professionals keep saying they will be over with in the future) I would be able to be fun, witty, full of ideas, great memory, etc. again, and stay on the dosage that helped me get free from psychosis without hallucinations and delusions. Am I wrong? There must be hope. I'm so afraid of going down in the current anti-psychotic medicine dosage of 2 mg in the morning and 2 mg in the evening. Edit: But my fast thinking mind isn't constant and slows down when psychosis is over so eventually meds would have to be regulated so that the anti-psychotics don't slow down my mind too much. Edit2: But my mind might have adapted so it can tolerate the effects of the anti-psychotics so my mind will be okay after I've overcome the negative symptoms.

1156,Be careful feeding your delusions,schizophrenia,"A few months ago I started experiencing smell hallucinations, different smells to which I assigned meanings. For example, cigarette smoke means God is calling me a coward, lentils means God is upset at me, piss means God is angry, diesel is God super angry, and a sweet smells means I'm a deceiver or the devil. I started to believe this was really God and I basically became the smell's bitch and allowed it to control me. I hated it so much but because I thought it was God I developed a Stockholm syndrome to it. And guess what it did, the smells stabbed me in the back. One day I got angry at religion (so much weird stuff in the bible I can't stand) and I got the diesel smell, then I said whatever I'm going to heaven and I got the deceiver smell. I became convinced for weeks that God had sealed my fate and I was going to hell. Then one day I told the smells to fuck off and that they are not God. God is not a dictator who would send me to hell for objecting to a line in the bible, or plague me with smells of shit and piss for months. I remembered all the times that the smells were really stupid, like at the psych ward I smelled the devil on my mother, so it's clearly not something I should worry about.

I can't trust that they're telling me the truth because they always make out that I'm severe and I really really don't think I am. I was bad last year, very delusional but since they put me on so many meds I'm not so bad which makes me think maybe I don't think I'm that bad because all the meds are keeping the delusions at bay.

I'm just tired. I'm confused. I feel like I brought all this on myself. I don't want to go on clozapine but my options were switch back to seroquel (which I hated) or come off my current meds and start Clozapine.

I'm scared because I want to stay on the meds I'm on but if I refuse seroquel or clozapine they can easily force me, it's happened before. They've threatened me with the police before. I don't want to go to hospital. I don't want to be in this situation and sometimes I don't even want to be alive.

1164,Anyone MORE religious when they're on medication?,schizophrenia,"I found a great deal of healing by following Episcopalian Christianity and ""finding Jesus,"" specifically a Jesus that wasn't trying to send me to Hell but rather help and heal me in ways that I cannot fathom.

But I noticed a cycle. Near the end of the month, when my injection wears off, I become very angry at God and disbelieving. My psychosis is tied directly to the belief of hell, and there is a negative correlation between my belief in hell and my belief in God. So when I'm psychotic, I think I'm going to Hell (or possibly am already in Hell) despite not being religious and not believing in God.

Which makes me wonder--did the antipsychotic CAUSE the belief in God or did the illness cause the disbelief? It's a chicken and egg situation, in a way. Which came first, my recovery, or the belief in Jesus? Did my belief cause my recovery or did my recovery cause my belief?

Anyone have any similar situation?

She NEVER throws away her favorite stuff just everyone else's she's thrown away her own family photos and her portfolio she loves to show everyone and even her modeling photos back in the day before she broke. Like literally her prized posestions that she would never throw out until recently now.

1209,Am I delusional or are my doctors right?,schizophrenia,"I guess I'm confused. Because since being admitted to hospital last year I've been on some insane doses of antipsychotic medication. Throughout being on and off meds & switching multiple times I've always believed the doses I've been on have been unnecessary. I don't consider my schizophrenia severe. However my doctors seem to believe I am on the more severe end and I jusut don't see it that way because I'm well on the meds.

But I know I'm not well now. The voices have become indistinguishable from reality. Because  I've tried so many meds that work for a while and then slowly stop working my final option, I've been told is to start Clozapine/Clozaril which I've read is a last resort drug for treatment resistant schizophrenia.

Maybe I'm in denial. Maybe I'm deluded. I just can't get my head around this. I have a week to think about it before I make my decision even though I feel like the decision has most likely already been made for me. Because my doctors aren't happy that my current combination of meds (Abilify & Olanzapine) are working and I can't really increase either as I'm almost at maximum dose.

I don't know what else to say. I'm confused. I can't trust the doctors because I don't think I'm really severe/treatment resistant but they think I am. Is the illness just messing with me this whole time and convinced me that I'm well when I'm not? I'm terrified of Clozapine & I just don't know what to do or think right now.

1217,"Wow, just realized I'm depressed as fuck",schizophrenia,"I've always thought I was depressed - can't get my mind off something, feel like I'm in hell, whatever. But recently just hit an unfound wave of depression. A hybrid wave. A massive fucking wave. I'm addicted to weed. I see myself being controlled by fucking demons. My most important interviews are coming up in days and I'm panicking so much. I'm having delusions that my dad killed my mom and she's screaming for me to help her. I'm getting in so many close calls while driving.

But it's okay. Tomorrow I'll wake up and it will all become regular again. My cries of help lie in my severe dehydration, b12 deficiency, and overall ass-kicking that I'm handing to my body. But for some reason, I won't pay attention to that either. I've been dehydrated for over 3 months now and at some points, I starved myself to the point where I was using body fat to meet equilibrium. My therapist is worried about me not eating enough, but I should let her know more about my dehydration. I talk to her tomorrow though so I'll actually let her know :))

When I drink water I feel like it's so foreign to my mouth that I see waves in my mouth when the water hits. When the water actually is in my mouth I feel like my tongue repels the water because it's so dry. I'm not fucking around, the water is repelled off of my tongue. This has partly been the reason why drinking water stopped being relevant in my life. I literally just won't realize that I'm not drinking water. With regards to the mention of relevancy in my life: I feel like I've started to rely on validating myself and my self-image, so I direct all my vibes and energy into my brain to supply myself all the validation I need to keep afloat.

I think the bittersweet part of this all is that I see myself inside. Even if I feel like I'm being controlled by my fucking demons, at least I know I'm still there. I'd rather know that I was actually there then just live as a demon without knowing for my whole life. And the real me is a real angel - they are. But I'm so far away from them in this hell, but they're an angel and they embody everyone here and all the beautiful people in the worlds. I try to learn from them as much as I can, but I don't see them very much. Now that I think of it my old friend in high school and I were talking about this demon idea at lunch. Weird how things connect together like that.

Edit: ""For the me that reads this later, don't dismiss this warning, please :(. Be yourself."" - I was originally going to edit this message into this post to make sure I remembered it when I was going over things with my therapist, but then I felt a dark force stand over my right shoulder commanding me to not write the reminder, THEY FUCKING COMMANDED ME.

1218,The mental illness acceptability seesaw,schizophrenia,"I feel as if there is this toxic seesaw in the societies’ views on mental illness, you either have depression, anxiety or the likes and are seen as cool, and brave, but it’s a completely polar opposite reaction with illnesses like schizophrenia, and you are seen as dangerous and to be avoided at all costs. I sort of feel as if as society is becoming more open to the idea of anxiety and depression being illnesses, and fairly common ones at that, schizophrenia is being more and more misunderstood, because the fear that was once over all mental health problems has now been shifted further onto us.

There another one where I could remember from when I was about 11 and all of my family was outside and I was in my room staring out the window and I can remember feeling “numb” not physically but like my apathy had been stolen away from me.

The thing about these memories are I’m not sure if they’re real or not, I have a very good memory and I think I would remember something like this if it happened to me. I’m also currently having trouble differentiating dreams from reality, 3 times this week I’ve asked my friend if things from my dreams happened or not, such as I thought that we were talking to my brother and he couldn’t remember the name of this very obscure Egyptian god and my friend was immediately like oh, that’s Anorethmatep.

1225,I'm seeing my doctor tomorrow & I'm scared because I think I'm unwell,schizophrenia,"I can't tell the voices apart from real sounds anymore. I just got back from spending the weekend with my friend but he kept muttering under his breath saying bad things about me, then a policeman called me a ""nutjob"" into his radio as I walked past.

This all started when I developed social anxiety about 2 months ago. I stopped leaving the house for a long time. It got worse. Then everyone told me to leave the house more and things should improve. So I've been leaving the house more but what's happening is everyone laughs at me when I'm outside. So many people do it. I hear them laugh then I hear them say things related to me.

I'm tired of it. When I'm outside I'm uncomfortable all the time. It's getting worse not better. I've been having a lot of ruminations and thought loops. I ruminate about the past. I ruminate about the future. I worry about something bad happening to people I care about. I get the same thoughts in my head on a loop over and over again and I can't control it. Intrusive thoughts are the worst.

I was doing so well but maybe the stress of sharing my story publicly has finally gotten to me. I don't think I can do the public speaking jobs anymore. The first one was amazing, the second one the voices wouldn't leave me alone. So now I'm worried I've disappointed the people who asked me to do it to begin with. Because I have two at the end of this week and I'm going to have to send an email tomorrow to say I can no longer do it.

I know I'm losing the plot which is a hard realisation to have. I'm just angry that I can't stop this. My life was just beginning to go somewhere and yet again my mental illness punches me in the face.

1248,how to deal with hallucination pain of bugs digging in my eye?? i’m afraid i’m going to end up blinding myself,schizophrenia,"i just commented on a post about my experience with this. 

basically there are times where i will feel a bug burrowed behind my left eye. i can’t see it, but i can feel it moving back there. and then it digs it’s razor sharp claws into my eye, and it’s like it’s eating my eye from the inside. 

i naturally start to panic, and i start digging at my eye trying to get it out. even though i am well aware of my diagnosis, i’m not processing at the time that the bug isn’t real (as i’m sure virtually everyone here will understand). all i know is the pain i feel, and that a bug is causing it. 

anyways i will end up digging at my eye for like 45 minutes in straight up tears trying to get the bug out. usually the mucus lining or whatever it’s called starts leaking out of my eye socket, and my eye gets extremely blood red and swollen, and my vision is blurred from all the digging (i’m digging underneath my eye inside the socket, not scratching the actual eyeball). the bug keeps running around back there and i can’t get it, and then when i’ll stop for a cry break, it’ll dig fucking harder, literally eating my eye. 

the past few times i broke down on the floor straight up balling begging for help. came real close to having someone take me to the ER. i end up wrapping my head and eye in extremely tight bandaging so there’s pressure on it and i won’t be able to physically hurt myself anymore, and i lay down crying feeling this bug eat my fucking eye until suddenly my brain decides it doesn’t want to fuck with me anymore and the hallucination stops. then i look at myself in the mirror like “what the fuck have i done to myself”

so, do any of you have ideas on how i can keep myself from hurting myself when this happens? trying to remind myself it’s not real doesn’t do anything. the pain is very much real to me and that’s all that matters. i’m genuinely scared i’m going to end up causing serious trauma to my eye the next time i have this episode and that i might accidentally blind myself. how do you distract yourself and get through it?",1,deal hallucination pain bug digging eye afraid going end blinding commented post experience basically time feel bug burrowed behind left eye see feel moving back dig razor sharp claw eye like eating eye inside naturally start panic start digging eye trying get even though well aware diagnosis processing time bug real sure virtually everyone understand know pain feel bug causing anyways end digging eye like minute straight tear trying get bug usually mucus lining whatever called start leaking eye socket eye get extremely blood red swollen vision blurred digging digging underneath eye inside socket scratching actual eyeball bug keep running around back get stop cry break dig fucking harder literally eating eye past time broke floor straight balling begging help came real close someone take er end wrapping head eye extremely tight bandaging pressure able physically hurt anymore lay cry feeling bug eat fucking eye suddenly brain decides want fuck anymore hallucination stop look mirror like fuck done idea keep hurting happens trying remind real anything pain much real matter genuinely scared going end causing serious trauma eye next time episode might accidentally blind distract get

We are the pioneers and it's up to us to make sense of it. It's obvious there is more too this thing than just delusion.

1256,fear seeking help,schizophrenia,"I don't know if I'm schizophrenic, or something else, but I'm beginning to wonder if I may be. Sorry this is a long post because I didn't want to leave out anything that might be important.   


**- I was diagnosed with depression about 3 years ago**  (I'm in my early 30's now) though I have probably suffered from this (**and anxiety**) my whole life and just didn't realize it - whenever I would mention the possibility of something being wrong with the way i was feeling or wrong with me, my family wouldn't take me seriously and didn't want me to take medication for anything because ""you dont want to mess with any of that stuff that'll screw with your brain"". Anyway when I was first diagnosed, I was horribly depressed and suicidal after suffering from job related loss and stress, accumulating in an overwhelming feeling of worthlessness. I currently think I'm still suffering from depression and anxiety but not nearly as bad as back then, and still currently take anxiety medication.  


**- I've suffered from insomnia** off and on over my lifetime, beginning in my 20s and continuing now. It usually is triggered by stress.   


**- I also have occasional sleep paralysis.** The hallucinations from that usually are just while I'm experiencing it, but on occasion after an experience I'll see something I saw in sleep paralysis out of the corner of my eye. In the very least it ""feels"" like it's still there/something is wrong. Everything will feel weird and ""off"" all day. I haven't had sleep paralysis in over a year thank god.   


**-  In my mid-to-late 20's I started getting increasingly paranoid**, my paranoia comes and goes but it usually revolves around work and/or strangers listening to me. I've thought in the past, as crazy as it sounds, that the administration at my work had bugged our desks or computers or something to listen in on what we were saying. Currently I believe they can somehow view anything we send over the wifi at work, and scan our emails. At my worst, I would experience things that would ""prove"" to me that these things were happening (ex: my self or someone mentioning something near a desk and soon after having an admin reference almost verbatim what had been said) I still have issues with eye contact and faces in general because I feel I'm constantly being judged.  


**The reason I'm considering seeking professional help is because other symptoms have started to develop at a pretty rapid pace and it's starting to worry me. It's affecting my every day life and hindering what I can do in a day. I thought it might me hormonally triggered, or perhaps its just stresses in general life that's triggered it.**   


**- I've lost all motivation.** Even when I think I want to do something (or need to do something) I don't.   
**- I've been avoiding social stuff**; I'll make plans with friends and then promptly cancel because my anxiety gets real bad.   
**- I bathe much less than I used to.** Not because I don't want to, but because I almost forget or just ""don't feel good enough to go do it"" which kind of sounds like depression but I never had issues with it before with depression.  
**- My general life has become increasingly disorganized** \- it's really bad. Not only do I leave things in a constant mess, but I will start doing something and completely go off track. I'll forget to eat then notice I'm hungry, so I'll start fixing something to eat and notice the dog needs food so I get his food ready and realize shit I'm still holding my cereal as I pour his food in his bowl; then I sit down and set the bowl down and forget to eat it because I noticed I left some project unfinished on the couch and I started working on that. I didn't used to be like this. I've described it as like, what I imagine ADD must be like? And that's what I thought this might be for awhile if it weren't for the following thing::  


**- Most worrisome is my brain has been ""buzzing""** \- I don't know any other way to describe it really. It's like many thoughts and voices all at once. I'll try to focus on one thought and before I can finish it my mind has jumped to another. It doesn't seem to have any specific triggers other than stress but it usually is at its worst at night, which has caused frequent bouts of insomnia over the past 6 months or so. On the rare occasion it happens during my waking hours, the voice(s) (which is similar to my inner voice but not quite the same) is usually telling me I'm worthless or stupid. Or it's like this constant stream of unintelligible whispers.   


**An example of the above affecting me at work**: Sometimes when I am helping a customer, because of my thoughts being jumbled I struggle to get what I want to say out. As soon as I realize it's not coming out quickly or in a way that makes sense, it gets worse and I start to slow down. Like I'll stop what I'm saying and search for my thoughts/words, and that makes it worse because now they're looking at me funny. Like ""and?"" or ""get to the point!"" or at least thats how my brain perceives it. The voice(s) start laying into me then like ""god just say something"" ""whats wrong with you"" etc etc   


Despite thinking I really need to talk to someone about this I'm absolutely terrified to. I don't know if having another mental illness labeling me is what is keeping me from doing it (I guess that'd be like, I feel ashamed to admit I have a problem?) or if it's because I'm afraid to tell my wife and family about it.

1257,"i can feel myself slipping into another psychotic episode, is there a way to stop it? advice is appreciated",schizophrenia,"tw for self harm, suicidal ideation

hey y'all. i posted to this subreddit long ago, and it was quite helpful if i remember correctly. 

ive been struggling to figure out how to articulate what's been going on with me lately. i can't tell if im going into an episode or if im already there. it's terrifying regardless.

this all started in my english class at college last week, my teacher dissected my paper in front of my class (with my permission) and i was good humored at first i think. however at some point while he read it, i started to hear this laughter all around the room. in my sane mind i know that everyone isn't laughing at me, it's a ridiculous thought. but it was so intense and overwhelming, and just wouldn't stop. i was extremely distraught by the end of the class, and cried for hours after. that was the first real hallucination i had since my last psychotic episode, what, 6 years ago?

ever since, i haven't been quite right. im mostly able to discern between reality and my delusions and hallucinations, but it's getting harder every day. i self harmed for the first time in YEARS. nothing drastic, but I fear what i might do in order to appease these intensifying voices i keep hearing. i know it's not reality but im so terrified. tomorrow im getting a medical withdrawal from school, and then  i have to figure out if i can keep my job there. i feel like im falling to pieces. 

i can't keep relying on my boyfriend to babysit me either. i feel awful for relying on him and being attached to his hip lately, but he's the only one i feel safe around. we took all the sharps out of the house, but he works all day, 8-12 hours, and mist weeks his only day off is sunday. i honestly don't trust myself to be alone for that long, even with the sharps gone i worry what i might do. i just want these voices to stop.

ive thought I might have to go back to the hospital, but they wouldn't take me last time i went, mostly because i downplayed everything. i would use that as a last resort, though. is there anything i can do to get myself out of this?",1,feel slipping another psychotic episode way stop advice appreciated tw self harm suicidal ideation hey posted subreddit long ago quite helpful remember correctly ive struggling figure articulate going lately tell im going episode im already terrifying regardless started english class college last week teacher dissected paper front class permission good humored first think however point read started hear laughter around room sane mind know everyone laughing ridiculous thought intense overwhelming stop extremely distraught end class cried hour first real hallucination since last psychotic episode year ago ever since quite right im mostly able discern reality delusion hallucination getting harder every day self harmed first time year nothing drastic fear might order appease intensifying voice keep hearing know reality im terrified tomorrow im getting medical withdrawal school figure keep job feel like im falling piece keep relying boyfriend babysit either feel awful relying attached hip lately one feel safe around took sharp house work day hour mist week day sunday honestly trust alone long even sharp gone worry might want voice stop ive thought might go back hospital take last time went mostly downplayed everything would use last resort though anything get

I am deeply struggling with the fact that what I see is concrete, there are clear pieces of evidence that should raise more pronounced fear or concern from others it seems, I show them to people, they acknowledge them and the oddness, and then go about their day. I fixate and start to spiral out until I can't deal with a blending of delusions and hallucinations mixed with fact to the point I can't stand straight and break down crying in frustration that what other people take for granted - a cohesive and understood layout of the world and reality - is so far removed. I feel like I'm peeking behind the curtain, like I almost have the ""admin"" code for life and then it all breaks apart.

I haven't wanted to accept the diagnosis, but I'm scared that if I don't and adequately medicate up then I'm likely to tailspin into pending homelessness, pushing away the few people I have left that I have any trust in that care for me, slinging wild accusations that feel so right in NY gut but I can't express the connections or reasons for in an appropriate way or with confidence. I feel a shell of the person I once was and I'm scrambling to find purpose and a baseline to go from - does anyone else deal with this kind of mental back and forth? How do you make commitments to loved ones and keep them (i.e. I trust you implicitly) without feeling like a total fool when you can't tell if you really do have reason to not trust them? 

Does anyone just feel like the world's biggest idiot and that your perpetually doomed to almost understand everything but too stupid to do take the basic actions neurotypicals take for granted?

Thanks so much for your help and insights, look forward to meeting everyone.",1,dealing fighting reality thats unclear hi joined group bit battle accepting trying deal schizoaffective diagnosis spent nearly month psychosis getting injectables okay dropped hated side effect another brief psychosis month later stress life got deeply struggling fact see concrete clear piece evidence raise pronounced fear concern others seems show people acknowledge oddness go day fixate start spiral deal blending delusion hallucination mixed fact point stand straight break cry frustration people take granted cohesive understood layout world reality far removed feel like peeking behind curtain like almost admin code life break apart wanted accept diagnosis scared adequately medicate likely tailspin pending homelessness pushing away people left trust care slinging wild accusation feel right ny gut express connection reason appropriate way confidence feel shell person scrambling find purpose baseline go anyone else deal kind mental back forth make commitment loved one keep e trust implicitly without feeling like total fool tell really reason trust anyone feel like world biggest idiot perpetually doomed almost understand everything stupid take basic action neurotypicals take granted thanks much help insight look forward meeting everyone

I've been trying so hard to get better and once I got my psychosis under control my depression is coming back. I was struggling to go outside and I've forced myself to go out so many times because everyone told me it would get easier. Every time I'm outside I think people are laughing and talking about me.

It's been destroying my confidence. I hate this illness. I hate how it's basically taken so much of my life and my future away from me. I developed memory and cognitive problems last year. The intrusive thought loops are becoming unbearable.

Some of you guys know I've been doing a few public speaking jobs, talking about my mental health. I've 3 more to do this month and I just don't want to do them anymore because the thought loops tell me I'm terrible.

I'm really feeling like my family would be better off without me if I'm being honest. I've caused them a lot of problems because of my illness. I know they love me but are most likely tired of me being in and out of hospital.

1308,Further Clarification,schizophrenia,"Hello.

I'm back.

And I have a lot of things to talk about while they're still in the forefront of my mind. Let's get to it.

\[You're going to need to read [https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/dcofxx/explaining/](https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/dcofxx/explaining/) for any clarity on what I'm going to be talking about.\]

&#x200B;

I've read a lot of things since I made this post. Mainly on how people experience Schizophrenia. What it's like. Many of them are vastly, *vastly* similar.

But they don't apply to me.

&#x200B;

What I feel is totally different. I wholeheartedly believe these things happen, don't get me wrong. I believe it almost religiously...

It's just it doesn't match to what other people seem to feel. It's *insane.*

&#x200B;

So, here goes.

&#x200B;

It's like my imagination gets out of control. None of it is really there. I can see straight through it. But my imagination, my mind's eye, it sees it. It's very, very difficult to explain.

You know how when you imagine someone is there, you can see them, but also straight through them as if they're not there? That's what my experiences are like, but on a much larger, much more intense scale. To the point it affects sound, feeling, environment.

It's like it's my imagination going haywire. I can see through it all. I can see reality in front of me. I can discern reality from imagination like nothing, at least, in visuals. Anything I see, I see reality, and then I see what I see.

I see reality. I see the real world. I can discern the real world.

It's like, at the same time that I see terrifying things, beings following others, the whole world shifting and glitching, I see through it, I see reality, the real world's colours and changes, and through the other things.

All at once.

&#x200B;

I can't explain it super well.

So maybe... I can put it in a hypothetical.

An imaginary friend. We've all had one once, right?

&#x200B;

You can 'see' said imaginary friend, especially when you're a kid. But at the same time, you're 100% aware they're not *truly* there. That they're only a figment of your imagination.

The only difference is that I can't control any of it. I can't make it stop. Thinking about it admittedly makes it happen more, but not by any influence of my own...

&#x200B;

Does it make me a fake? Is this just me seeking attention?  
I can't tell.  
I... Wish I knew the answer. Wish I could say I did, but I don't. I really, honestly don't.

I don't fully understand.

Is this even a disorder? Or is this just...

A figment of my own imagination?

Could I stop it? Or do I just not try?

&#x200B;

...

I don't know.

But I know one thing for damn sure.

People with *Schizophrenia* don't feel like this.

And that sucks. A lot. Because that means one thing.

***Th******ere is no existing explanation for what the hell this is.***

And if that's not the most invalidating thing on the planet, that what you have probably isn't even a condition at all, and that it's just you, but you don't even know what to do about it, then I don't know what the hell invalidation is at all.

&#x200B;

Does this even make sense?

1309,Being treated differently after diagnosis.,schizophrenia,"I was diagnosed last year. Since diagnosed I've been treated differently. The major problems are coming from doctors. I've had some bad luck with them but now they think I'm a headcase. First off I see a pchycaitrist so that is the only person I want to talk to about my situation. I went to start up with a new doctor at the beginning of the year and she was acting all weird and jumpy and eventually my mom got out of the waiting room and came in to talk with us. Basically the new doctor was being extremely nosey and wanted to know why I was diagnosed with schizophrenia. I didn't feel like we had to go into detail about everything but we did and it was incredibly uncomfortable and awkward. So she sets me up with a specialist (non mental health related). I go and see her and I'm laughing to myself because when I see her I'm thinking you can't be serious... You would have to be there! Anyway I feel kinda uncomfortable so I decide to have my mom come in with me. We start talking and the girl is kinda rude at first and doesn't introduce herself or anything. Then she slights me and makes insinuations about aspergers which I have btw. She then talks up about her ""boyfriend"" and other BS. So I'm sitting there thinking wow why is she being a massive bitch towards me. I showed zero interest in her and she is acting like she is all high and mighty. I tried very hard to keep it professional and get something out of the visit but she just didn't want to listen and kept acting as if my problems are not a problem. So I decided not to go back to my GP doctor until I get the flu or w/e. I still need a specialist so I'm either going to fire her or go back in deal with more bs.

Lastly I've been treated poorly by my own family. My mom's new catch phrase is ""I'm going to tell your psychiatrist."" My mom flips out over little complaints I make and turns it into ""your mentally ill"". My brother also laughs at me all the time because sometimes I say something about my diagnosis. My sister use to be a psych nurse so she always adds her two cents in. 

I'm just tired of being treated like I have some probablem. When the doctors acted all freaked out like I have some file on me (which i probably do) I felt crushed. If this was years ago I probably would of filed a complaint on the specialist for mocking people with disabilities.

The hallucinations are very in-depth and there's a *lot* of code behind them. The game has randomly-generated NPCs that spawn. So, what can happen, is you find some guy, and start talking to him, then suddenly he attacks you, you open fire, and he disappears. 

The game has a system for hearing sounds, and hallucinations can abuse this. Hearing bumps and thumps and glass breaking, then checking and finding no zombies. Being woken up from sleep by things that aren't there.

1331,CW: I just texted with the Crisis Line.,schizophrenia,"Honestly, it was okay. It was about 2 hours ago. The person who talked was able to talk to me in a calm manner and it's definitely been the best experience I've had with a crisis line contact. 

The reason I texted the line was because I've felt extremely distressed. My paranoia has reached new levels of bad and the universal entity voice has started giving me even more harmful commands. I hate it. I'll try [attempting to] taking a nap watching a video essay on Final Fantasy and then out of nowhere a voice on top of the video just says ""Oh, hi."" That freaked me the fuck out. Needless to say, no sleeping happened after that. Afterwards, I was working out for a bit, as I'm stretching my arms and back I hear a loud sigh in the back of my ear. Other stuff is just background white noise. Like, I was at a family birthday, as the chill and playful children's music played (with Zelda sprinkled in for good measure) and then out of nowhere I just start hearing like faint noisy drones and guitar chords in the background. Asked my wife if she heard anything and all she said was ""I'm sorry, babe. I didn't.""

I just keep getting these. Sporadically. Through out the day. Meanwhile, the universe voice will pester me through out the day. ""Write the book or go hurt yourself. I'm only trying to protect you."" Mind you, I did start said book. I just don't feel like giving this voice the power she wants. I want to retain that last strand of power I have over my life. At the end of the day I fell passed out cuz I had barely slept the night before and had been up since like 4 am hearing different muffled and garbled voices. Like hearing people talking in other rooms but with phone quality voices.

I even got a call from my general practice with them telling me they were highly worried of me and what I had told them I was going through and should consider full hospitalization. 

How is hospitalization? I've been avoiding getting to the point in which that is option I desperately needed, but I think I've been at the point of needing it for years but just living in constant denial.

1332,Accepting lost functionality,schizophrenia,"I'm trying not to feel so low right now, but I do.

Over the past year, as I've experienced a lot of episodes. I have lost a lot of functionality over this time and required significant accommodations to get by. I was talking with my pdoc about this yesterday, and when I asked when it would start to get better, she told me it's gotten better than it was, which it has. But this improvement has started to even out. And she asked me ""what if it never gets entirely better and you're never at 100% again?"" And I've suspected for a while that this might be the case. But being asked that caused it to really hit me like a punch. What if I really am losing functionality, and will have lost it permanently? 

I've been struggling just to keep from losing my job. On good days I can even see friends. But I have as many bad days as good, sometimes more. I know that there are many people on this sub who deal with this and to a greater degree than I have. But I'm really struggling to accept this. I try to keep myself on the page of accepting myself where I am, and respecting my limitations and boundaries. This acceptance has taken a LOT of work on my part. But this new boundary, having to move the line of my limitations and accept that this is a permanent thing feels so hard. 

For those who have gone through this, how did you do it? Was there something specific that helped? Do I just need to give in to this? And even if you haven't gone through this, I could use words of support. 

Thank you, friends.",1,accepting lost functionality trying feel low right past year experienced lot episode lost lot functionality time required significant accommodation get talking pdoc yesterday asked would start get better told gotten better improvement started even asked never get entirely better never suspected might case asked caused really hit like punch really losing functionality lost permanently struggling keep losing job good day even see friend many bad day good sometimes know many people sub deal greater degree really struggling accept try keep page accepting respecting limitation boundary acceptance taken lot work part new boundary move line limitation accept permanent thing feel hard gone something specific helped need give even gone could use word support thank friend

1345,I need some advice on how to convince my mom that D&D is not causing my symptoms,schizophrenia,"So, I recently started opening up about my symptoms and getting the help I need. I met with a therapist for the diagnostic meeting, it's suspected I've got schizophrenia. 

My mother is new to all this and is understandably frazzled. She mentioned that me playing D&D could be adding to this because it's fantasy. The therapist very professionally and logically shut that down. Unfortunately, my mother is very persistent with her ideas. We continued the session as normal, she did surrender. Immediately after my mother resumed trying to convince me, not only that it's adding, but causing my hallucinations because I'm ""opening so many gateways so you're open to attacks \[from demons\]""

I have *TRIED* to tell my mom that the board game is not summoning **fucking demons**, and that, in fact, me, my friends, and everyone else who plays the game is not automatically delusional. People who play D&D do not think the game is real, I assured her. I am just sick.

I'm honestly at my wits end here, I'm the one with the disconnect from reality yet I've got to be the voice of reason, and apparently an ineffectual one. She's also convinced that I don't need anti-psychotics and should instead try natural remedies like chiropracty for *psychosis*.

I wouldn't bother, and just stop talking to her until she cools off, but I'm a minor and her treatment is in her fucking hands, and I'd rather be able to function than losing my mind while encouraging my mother's unreasonable distrust of proven medical science in favor of cobbled, unverified science.",1,need advice convince mom causing symptom recently started opening symptom getting help need met therapist diagnostic meeting suspected got schizophrenia mother new understandably frazzled mentioned playing could adding fantasy therapist professionally logically shut unfortunately mother persistent idea continued session normal surrender immediately mother resumed trying convince adding causing hallucination opening many gateway open attack demon tried tell mom board game summoning fucking demon fact friend everyone else play game automatically delusional people play think game real assured sick honestly wit end one disconnect reality yet got voice reason apparently ineffectual one also convinced need anti psychotic instead try natural remedy like chiropracty psychosis bother stop talking cool minor treatment fucking hand rather able function losing mind encouraging mother unreasonable distrust proven medical science favor cobbled unverified science

1352,I just started a new med and I think this is what I've needed all along. (I promise I'm not a pharma represantative),schizophrenia,"It's a partial D3 agonist, acting as a mood stabilizer and anti-psychotic that instead of just reducing dopamine mediates it in the brain, so if there is too low dopamine it will increase it, if there is too high dopamine it will decrease it. It's called Vraylar.

I have been having serious difficulties with psychosis since starting college, and I just met with a new psychiatrist here. She worked through her lunch break to talk to me for 2 whole hours. She was very energetic and charismatic. She just totally ""gets it"" and I find that in wanting in a lot of psychiatrists. After talking with me, she said she is going to lower the dose of risperidone and add Vraylar which is pro-cogntive and helps with negative symptoms. I have noticed both of these effects very strong.

I just feel focused, motivated, calm, peaceful, happy. It completely quells my cravings for stimulants. The only thing that is neutral about it, not good, is that it makes me feel kind of strange or ""wonky."" But it doesn't seem like most anti-psychotics where it just totally kills your creativity and intelligence. I feel like I have perhaps an enhanced creativity right now. It's as if it still allows me to access the highly spiritual, peak, creative energy of the states of psychosis, that are a fundamental part of who I am and what makes life worth living, without the psychosis itself.

Idk, I was VERY skeptical about adding another anti-psychotic, but her goal is to get me off the risperidone eventually which was my goal as well, and I don't want to jinx it, but this may be actually just what I need.

Wish me luck for the long-term.",1,started new med think needed along promise pharma represantative partial agonist acting mood stabilizer anti psychotic instead reducing dopamine mediates brain low dopamine increase high dopamine decrease called vraylar serious difficulty psychosis since starting college met new psychiatrist worked lunch break talk whole hour energetic charismatic totally get find wanting lot psychiatrist talking said going lower dose risperidone add vraylar pro cogntive help negative symptom noticed effect strong feel focused motivated calm peaceful happy completely quells craving stimulant thing neutral good make feel kind strange wonky seem like anti psychotic totally kill creativity intelligence feel like perhaps enhanced creativity right still allows access highly spiritual peak creative energy state psychosis fundamental part make life worth living without psychosis idk skeptical adding another anti psychotic goal get risperidone eventually goal well want jinx may actually need wish luck long term

Truthfully I like the voices, the shadow people not as much but you cant pick and choose the symptoms medications eliminate. I was never on the side of delusional or paranoid though, and I thank my lucky stars for that everyday but I do have some other issues that arise on the emotional side. 

&#x200B;

Lately I started dating someone new, and as you all probably know, choosing when and who to tell about your disorder is a very tricky game to play. You wait too long, you run the risk of them not being ok with it and leaving or using it against you in a lot of ways (been there, done that). You tell them too quickly, its a real bonding moment and it shouldnt be shared with everyone. You have to gauge them, their beliefs, the relationship, everything really. A big thing for me is also I feel like the things I have told people before I tell them I am schizophrenic are immediatly put into question. 

&#x200B;

I have had a lot of unique experiences, Ive traveled to 3rd world countries for research, almost been arrested, seen massacre photos/videos, Ive seen people get killed, Ive lived in abject poverty, etc. But I feel like when I say ""Hey I got schizophrenia"" it makes people question whether or not the things Ive seen or done actually happened. Does anyone else feel like the moment they say ""hey I have \_\_\_\_\_"" the people they tell automatically doubt everything they've ever said.

I would like to get a decent paying job and live a normal life, but my social skills have gone to dog shit and so has my memory, focus and energy, oh and I also am being gang stalked everywhere I go.
I saw some videos online with people who have it more advanced than I do and it was pretty depressing... I'm praying with meds it doesn't progress or I get better.

1372,Explaining,schizophrenia,"I've never really explained what my experiences are like. I feel like I should go in depth and see if other people are like me, perhaps. I know it's unlikely.

I've been directed to Schizophrenia because every search I've ever made suggests me the disorder, some scholarly article. I dunno if I fit the bill, though, at least fully.

Let's divide into categories: Visual, auditory, feeling, tasting, smelling, mental.


**Visual**
I see things others don't. I call them entities. They're tall beings usually around eight feet or taller, usually double the height of the person they're associated with.

They follow everyone, and have terrifying grins. I can't always see them, though. Only sometimes, though, I always feel their eyes, their presense. They watch, observe, and stare. It's terrifying to see them.

Along with this, I see something I call the other world. I'm convinced it's real. The other world creates attributes for people. Wings, eyes, horns: you name it. There's a person with it. It's always dark, always spooky. Eyes are always following and hunting you in the other world.

It often comes in flashes, with wind blowing in my eyes. I see the other side, the one that others don't. In the other world I have wings and ears, and everything has a sort of mythical attribute. Sometimes it leaks into the real world. I feel like this is where the entities come from.

It really sounds like something from Stranger Things, if you need something to compare it to. Like the world Will was in, but, without the toxic crap and the weird stuff everywhere. Just dark and desolate, nothing really dead though.

**Auditory**
I hear things. So many things. From whips cracking to screams, to doors shutting and distant chatter that I can *almost* make out, but not quite.

I can hear distant conversations from people, often at night when no one else is awake. Like people are here, after me, going to come for me.

I also heard glass shatter and other odd clicking sounds.

**Feeling**
I feel touches all over me, like people's hands, and get random shivers because I feel something on me. I look down and nothing is there though.

I also often feel bugs crawling on me. Bugs, spiders, ants; all sorts of things.

**Tasting**
This should be pretty self explanatory. Most of the time it's random nostalgic ones, things I haven't eaten in 47258826294 years or, oddly enough, iron.

**Smelling**
What I smell is super hard to describe. They're very vivid and unnatural that I can't compare them to anything, honestly.

**Mental**
This is the one I've been waiting to get to.

Everyone is out to get me, I swear it. I feel like any time I see a man, or a woman, or even a kid, it's like they're plotting my death, or don't like me. I'm paranoid.

Like, any time I see a group of men, I feel like they're automatically out to get me, or my family.

I feel watched by people constantly, their opinions burning into my skull. I feel everyone is out to get me, like someone will randomly recognize me and jump me in the middle of the store.

As well as this, I feel like I often have trouble controlling my actions.
Sometimes I get bouts of violent feelings.

I have this dog I love, her name is Star. But when I was alone with her in the car once, with the window slightly cracked, I wanted to take her little body, shove it through forcefully, just to let her drop to the ground below.

I wanted to h u r t her. Something I'd never wanted to do before. And I've felt this way for everyone at least once. My own dogs, my family, cousins, friends...

Later she came to me and she offered me something that is really dear to her : a small porcelain angel. She is a devout catholic and you probably can understand what it represents to her, even more knowing that she can't have a lot of belongings because of her total lack of money.

1393,What does disordered thinking feel like for you,schizophrenia,"I'm going to see a psychiatrist soon about a range of experiences (I'll spare you my history and leave the diagnosing to the professionals), but I really want to know what disordered thinking feels like because I'm trying to understand my own experiences. I have times where I just really struggle to organise and understand my thoughts and I can't find much about what that looks like for other people.

I've seen the diagnostic details around what disordered thinking is but it's mostly focused on speech (because a psychiatrist can't see inside your mind) and for me when it hits I really struggle to get out any words at all. 

I have racing thoughts sometimes, which I've seen others talk about, but basically I have times where my mind just kind of gets overwhelmed. I'll find myself just staring at one spot and struggling to make sense of what my thoughts actually are. it's almost like I get flashes of things like faces or concepts or things to think about but they aren't fully formed and they all just blend together, it's almost like having a trippy dream. I feel like I cant hear properly when this happens and I'm kind of unable to do anything except wait for it to pass. Sometimes I'll get very frustrated too because I try and communicate with my wife and I just can't find any words. 

Earlier this year it got very bad, and has been sporadically bad since, but I felt like my mind was empty a lot of the time and I was experiencing what I now know to be thought blocking. It was really scary because it just felt like I had a complete cognitive decline and couldn't really focus on anything or keep anything in my memory for a good few weeks.

I've also had some experiences before where written words have stopped making sense to me, they just seem like letters, and while I've had a very small amount of experience with things like hallucinations and delusions, it seems like my thinking is my weak spot and what tends to go when my mental health gets poor.  

Is this relatable at all? I guess i'm just trying to make sense of this particular symptom. It's something I struggle to even explain as it feels so strange when its happening (how do you explain what you can't even think).",1,disordered thinking feel like going see psychiatrist soon range experience spare history leave diagnosing professional really want know disordered thinking feel like trying understand experience time really struggle organise understand thought find much look like people seen diagnostic detail around disordered thinking mostly focused speech psychiatrist see inside mind hit really struggle get word racing thought sometimes seen others talk basically time mind kind get overwhelmed find staring one spot struggling make sense thought actually almost like get flash thing like face concept thing think fully formed blend together almost like trippy dream feel like cant hear properly happens kind unable anything except wait pas sometimes get frustrated try communicate wife find word earlier year got bad sporadically bad since felt like mind empty lot time experiencing know thought blocking really scary felt like complete cognitive decline really focus anything keep anything memory good week also experience written word stopped making sense seem like letter small amount experience thing like hallucination delusion seems like thinking weak spot tends go mental health get poor relatable guess trying make sense particular symptom something struggle even explain feel strange happening explain even think
1394,[Recommendation] This was an OAT test that I did to find out why I ever received a diagnosis and what I needed to supplement to get better. If you want to know which supplements you need to take to improve your health then I highly recommend this test!,schizophrenia,"This was an Organic acid test that I did a few months ago. The link to imgur shows the results that I had gotten back and they show what a mess my body was. I know these tests are available in the United States and in Canada. If you’re Canadian like me, then try your best to go through the medical system to get one of these tests done. Otherwise, any naturopathic doctor that you can find will set you up with one of these (obviously you will have to pay for the meeting with the naturopath and for the test which could be around $250 CAD). It’s a urine test that is sent to The Great Plains laboratory in Alberta. I don’t know about the States but I do know it’s available over there. This test showed me which vitamins I was deficient in which is *crucial* for knowing what supplements I needed to take. Schizophrenia is an overall unhappy and unhealthy body. Symptoms of schizophrenia are vast and they vary. They are all linked to one or more or a combination of vitamin deficiencies.  Deficiency in the vitamin B series is typical for people experiencing delusions or hallucinations. Now that I know vitamin B6 was my deficiency and also vitamin C, I now can take those vitamins in concentrated form and I’m thinking sooo much better. People that are suffering, or people that know other people who are suffering, if you have the time and the care to get one of these tests done for someone in need of care, this is the best way to get started on an eventual full recovery!

1397,What am I to do?,schizophrenia,"24(GF) with schizoaffective disorder. I'm trying to keep this short. Depression came early, officially though in 7th grade. My parents never believed in mental illness. I felt unheard all my life. Fighting so hard to live. I broke. I went so long untreated. When eventually my high school told them to at least get a therapist (and the also put me in a special needs program), the therapist told them I need medication. They refused. And I fell deeper and deeper into an abyss. I was explosive to them and was bounced back and forth between living with my mom (who couldn't deal with me) to my dad who lived in the ghetto. Gunshots, mold, crack heads, abusers that lived above us, roaches, rats, etc. I slept on the couch because it was a one bedroom and my grandmother also lived there. 

By senior year I was done. Had my first big psychotic break. I skipped classes or slept in them or just spaced out. After school i was shoe horned into taking care of multiple grandparents with various levels of disabilities. My great grandma, great great aunt, my great grandpa, my uncles mother and now my dad's mother. They all passed one by one and I was moved to the next. My psychosis grew, my depression grew, anxiety, panic disorder, bpd,etc. 

I'm to a point where my brain has shriveled cognitively. Cant read and sometimes cant even watch tv. Cant handle stress or sudden changes of plans, etc. very well. Can't write as well. Can't focus. Slow reaction speed. Short AND long term memory loss. I'm on medication now but they aren't helping as much. Feeling suicidal again. 

All this time my parents never took initiative to learn about my mental illness so this causes many problems amongst us. I've never had a job due to illness and taking care of grandparents, but I don't think I can (not a normal one) but I'm also not sick enough for disability plus the no job thing. Learning new things is hard now and I can't drive because of mental problems (If I'm not feeling anxious to the point of panic attacks or feeling suicidal then I'm spacing out to the point of not even seeing a car in front of me which almost got me killed because by the time I came to I couldn't even react fast enough. Thank the stars that my dad was there.)

So I'm stuck living with my parents and being home all day taking care of my grandma. No money for myself. Causing rifts between family. Struggling with my health and therefore struggling with taking proper care of my grandma. Which shes more priority than myself. But to my parents my health isn't a priority. Therapy appointments go missed. Never help with keeping my meds on track (because I forget). Never help with making calls (I do it myself but I put it off because I know I'd have to work around their schedule anyway which everything else comes first most of the time).

I want to move out and back to the city at least thered be uber and stuff. I want to maybe take art classes because I see myself being a writer and an artist but I find it hard to learn anymore. I want consistency in my health care(physical and mental). I want my own life. I want to be able to buy deodorant and not have to wait for them. Or soap, or toothpaste. Or new clothes because the ones I have are ripped or don't fit. I want to eat how I want. But how? How? What do I do? I'm stuck. I'm drowning.

1437,Need advice dealing with schizophrenic partner,schizophrenia,"Hello everyone. Throwaway for obvious reasons.

I have a partner with a schizophrenic history, diagnosis and medical treatment. As far as I can tell, there have been voices and the feeling of a presence that has implanted a device inside her head and that wants to kill her, if she doesn't do as commanded - which is also what holds her back from talking too much about it, when she's in a state of acute psychosis.

We have been together for almost three months now and so far, it seemed like with the meds and therapy, she has it under control. This evening though (it's night now and she's sleeping), she started asking weird questions like ""How will he find us tomorrow?"". They are weird because neither does anyone of us have an appointment with a man tomorrow, neither could she tell me, who she was talking about or what that person wanted. At one point she told me, that she felt weird for asking me about him, but she didn't seem to doubt that there was someone, even if she could not at all explain to me, who that person was. It doesn't seem ""really bad"" or anything yet, but it's irritating to me at least.

My partner has prepared me for acute phases of psychosis only by saying that I will ""know it when I see it"" and that I should just bring her to a hospital if it gets too bad. I guess I'm most nervous about not being able to judge, when that time has come. Especially since she starts feeling weird talking about ""that man"" already, I'm afraid that she'll just hold back sharing with me, what's going on or what she feels is going on. I'm trying to be supportive. Of course I tried to gain more details by asking about who that man is or what he wants, but got no answers (again - not sure if she had none or if she doesn't want to share them).

Can you please give me some non-medical advice about how to cope with this, according to your experiences? How can I figure out when I need to intervene? When should I just be there and provide comfort and an open ear? At the moment, I just hope that after sleeping for the night, tomorrow it'll be back to normal. But how can I be sure? I appreciate all of your thoughts and related experiences that can help me deal with this in a appropriate way.

1443,Don't know how I can help or even have a relationship with my mother,schizophrenia,"My mother has lived in assisted living due to her schizophrenia for the past decade. I've had limited contact with her until I was an adult and had more say.

For over 20 years, she's believed that she's pregnant, and doctors are conspiring to cover it. Recently, she's started also thinking that she can die any day if she doesn't give birth. For the last 3 months, she's been trying to get an ER to help her, and instead gets sent to the psychiatric ward for a few days.

As of this week, she's switched to her more common plan in response to her pregnancy, which is it's own complicated situation, but thankfully has no way of being implemented. 

That's the main situation, but there are many branching delusions.

I am the only child of hers who regularly talks to her. I am the only family in this country who can be relied upon for her treatment. But I have zero idea how to help her now. 

I'm currently rebuilding my life after my own trauma, a lot of which she indirectly caused. I had a few opportunities to get away from my abusive father when I was younger,  but she either intervened or chastised me for ""even thinking about it"". Mostly bc it'd mess up her own plans involving her own personal revenge on him. 

Even besides that, she's hurt me so much. I can't share much of my own life without her ridiculing my choices or being extremely invasive. It took years for her to stop seeing me as fucked up for being gay, and I doubt she's fully stopped. I had to beg her to stop telling me her bizarre assumptions + questions about my sex life. 

 I've had rose colored glasses on for so long. First thinking I can significantly help her, then just telling myself she's a good person, I can enjoy being around her, that I can be *comfortable* around her. But I don't know anymore. All I feel about her is either anger, guilt, or dread- all feelings that my friends would usually say should result in cutting a parent off, but I can't in this situation without being a heartless monster.",1,know help even relationship mother mother lived assisted living due schizophrenia past decade limited contact adult say year believed pregnant doctor conspiring cover recently started also thinking die day give birth last month trying get er help instead get sent psychiatric ward day week switched common plan response pregnancy complicated situation thankfully way implemented main situation many branching delusion child regularly talk family country relied upon treatment zero idea help currently rebuilding life trauma lot indirectly caused opportunity get away abusive father younger either intervened chastised even thinking mostly bc mess plan involving personal revenge even besides hurt much share much life without ridiculing choice extremely invasive took year stop seeing fucked gay doubt fully stopped beg stop telling bizarre assumption question sex life rose colored glass long first thinking significantly help telling good person enjoy around comfortable around know anymore feel either anger guilt dread feeling friend would usually say result cutting parent situation without heartless monster
1444,I keep fantasizing about killing myself,schizophrenia,"I feel ok, even great, when I’m around people but I get so inundated with negative thoughts when I’m alone. I am so goddamn lonely too. But I have so many issues working against me to prevent people (namely a partner) coming into my life. I feel like things are too fucked up, and I’m too fucked up, to ever get better. Then there’s these goddamn grandiose delusions about the future, which I think might be keeping me alive, but almost definitely aren’t real and are really distressing. I don’t know if I want them gone so i can move on or if I need them. It’s like a catch-22.

I also have no goddamn patience and feel like I’m going to snap at the tiniest things. But I’m not at all like this when I’m out or around people.

Some of them had family members that killed themselves and they just seemed devastated but in this quiet sort of way. I pictured my friends and family being like that and thought I can’t do this.

But then a second ago, I was thinking about everything and had the thought that I can just go fucking kill myself again. It would be so easy and it would take less than an hour total to set up.

1454,Limited awareness?,schizophrenia,"When I was really sick, I would have severe delusions, but not voices. It was like being stuck in a sticky spiderweb and being unable to get out, or at least it was extremely difficult. However even during the worst delusional episodes I felt I was partially aware that what I believed can't be real, but it felt like that part of me was forced out of my consciousness, almost muffled, so that it couldn't really influence my thinking. It always felt like my awareness and cognition were narrowed into a small shell and that any sane, rational thoughts were just bouncing off this shell, unable to reach a point where they could be debated, analyzed, taken seriously.

During my illness I was aware that something was seriously wrong with me, and I tried my best, even though the cognitive decline got worse with time regardless of whether I managed to break out of a delusional spell or not. I am wondering if anyone of you was at least somewhat aware that they were slowly going insane? For me the delusions seemed to precede the cognitive decline up until recently, so I guess I was more able to analyze my own behavior, but I know that most schizophrenics have no awareness that they're not thinking properly.",1,limited awareness really sick would severe delusion voice like stuck sticky spiderweb unable get least extremely difficult however even worst delusional episode felt partially aware believed real felt like part forced consciousness almost muffled really influence thinking always felt like awareness cognition narrowed small shell sane rational thought bouncing shell unable reach point could debated analyzed taken seriously illness aware something seriously wrong tried best even though cognitive decline got worse time regardless whether managed break delusional spell wondering anyone least somewhat aware slowly going insane delusion seemed precede cognitive decline recently guess able analyze behavior know schizophrenic awareness thinking properly

I have tried almost every antipsychotic and antidepressive there is, but now I am stable with clozapine, risperidone and  fluvoxamine.Although I'm stable with those meds I still feel bad, nervous, my throat closing, a pressure in the chest, ears and head. I'm also sure that I have some solutions that are really hard to fight with.

1458,Don't know how I can help or even have a relationship with my mother,schizophrenia,"My mother has lived in assisted living due to her schizophrenia for the past decade. I've had limited contact with her until I was an adult and had more say.

For over 20 years, she's believed that she's pregnant, and doctors are conspiring to cover it. Recently, she's started also thinking that she can die any day if she doesn't give birth. For the last 3 months, she's been trying to get an ER to help her, and instead gets sent to the psychiatric ward for a few days.

As of this week, she's switched to her more common plan in response to her pregnancy, which is it's own complicated situation, but thankfully has no way of being implemented.

That's the main situation, but there are many branching delusions.

I am the only child of hers who regularly talks to her. I am the only family in this country who can be relied upon for her treatment. But I have zero idea how to help her now.

I'm currently rebuilding my life after my own trauma, a lot of which she indirectly caused. I had a few opportunities to get away from my abusive father when I was younger, but she either intervened or chastised me for ""even thinking about it"". Mostly bc it'd mess up her own plans involving her own personal revenge on him.

Even besides that, she's hurt me so much. I can't share much of my own life without her ridiculing my choices or being extremely invasive. It took years for her to stop seeing me as fucked up for being gay, and I doubt she's fully stopped. I had to beg her to stop telling me her bizarre assumptions + questions about my sex life.

I've had rose colored glasses on for so long. First thinking I can significantly help her, then just telling myself she's a good person, I can enjoy being around her, that I can be *comfortable* around her. But I don't know anymore. All I feel about her is either anger, guilt, or dread- all feelings that my friends would usually say should result in cutting a parent off, but I can't in this situation without being a heartless monster.",1,know help even relationship mother mother lived assisted living due schizophrenia past decade limited contact adult say year believed pregnant doctor conspiring cover recently started also thinking die day give birth last month trying get er help instead get sent psychiatric ward day week switched common plan response pregnancy complicated situation thankfully way implemented main situation many branching delusion child regularly talk family country relied upon treatment zero idea help currently rebuilding life trauma lot indirectly caused opportunity get away abusive father younger either intervened chastised even thinking mostly bc mess plan involving personal revenge even besides hurt much share much life without ridiculing choice extremely invasive took year stop seeing fucked gay doubt fully stopped beg stop telling bizarre assumption question sex life rose colored glass long first thinking significantly help telling good person enjoy around comfortable around know anymore feel either anger guilt dread feeling friend would usually say result cutting parent situation without heartless monster

1462,"I hope i don’t come off as mean or self indulged. my good mother doesnt deserve to hear these awful things again and again and again anymore. so instead, here you go",schizophrenia,"I had an issue nearly a year ago. The voices told me to stab the teachers and i saw demons following me everywhere. I think I lost it but I remained insightful. I am very insightful, and I am normal most of the time. I took Olanzapine for awhile along with 3 anxiety meds because i must be made a zombie according to the doctors. I stopped trusting them, I think they wanted to label me schizoaffective, but i don’t like that. the doctors just wanted to poison me for money so i stopped going. 

my issue?
i feel very alone, and i feel like no one will ever understand me. they just don’t get it, and i can never find the correct combination of words for them to get it. my issue has completely enveloped my life and it’s isolated me. i can’t connect to people and they scare me. the therapist was nice but she never understood. only i understand and that is lonely. i want someone to see what i saw and feel what i felt. i want someone to just understand. but they can’t, and i have to hide what i’ve gone through because they want to send me away to the hospital to poison me for money. 

i’m tired...
this new life of mine is very stressful, but i swear i’m normal. i’m just stressed. like tonight, tonight i was followed home by many demons. it was annoying because they’re too quick to get a good glimpse of them. i swear if i catch one i will kill it and win. i am normal most of the time. i have a job and i have friends i think. but my mind is far away, it doesn’t do normal human things. maybe i’m just not human, i’m just a thing. a collection of actions backed by desire. not to mention the world isn’t real 60% of the time. it looks almost like a passive painting in which i am enjoying. i just sit there watching as the world spins and falls and moves around me and i am perfectly content. 

tonight is a bad night.
my girlfriend and i have been fighting. school has been stressful and i have many tests. i don’t sleep at night anymore. i work 5 hour shifts every night after school 5-10. it builds up and the stress makes me bad i think. stress causes flare ups. but i’m not crazy i’m not crazy i’m not crazy i’m not crazy i’m not crazy. i’m smart, i can do things i’m not crazy. i test well and i have high aspirations for my life. i want to be a psychiatrist and run a therapy first, medication to stabilize, type of inpatient unit. i know a lot about clinical psychology and i have a lot to learn. but i can’t do it, they will win in the end i fear, i am not strong enough to beat the invisible hand. why go on with the thing that keeps it going. sometimes i can’t do it anymore and i just need someone to understand

1467,My latest theory. Trigger warning.,schizophrenia,"Some (or most) humans have gone through very long dreams in which they have been enlightened and endowed with a divine energy. These dreams can last years, decades, centuries. Who knows. During this dream they learn the power of language and the power of energy. They wake up almost super human and with a goal: to help enlighten the rest of the world. They speak in code and can feel our energies perfectly. They have a godlike conciousness. They understand the plan and pattern of the universe and are one with it. They are in such a higher dimension of conciousness than us that we cant even comprehend. Us schizophrenics are surrounded by these beings and they talk in code connected to our thoughts as a way to try to help us understand. Or simply guide our thoughts. This is why 2 people sitting next to you talking about nonsense can seemingly be directing what they are saying at you. They have infinite power with language. They also keep it a perfect secret. They have these dreams every night and are trillions? Quadrillions? Eternities old? Who knows. They might meet each other in secret during the dreams and discuss the next day on earth. Maybe the dreams can be shared. I went to the hospital with this theory thinking they were going to give me the red pill and turn me into one of them. That didnt happen.

1472,Diagnosed with schizophrenia but think I have health anxiety?,schizophrenia,"I was diagnosed with schizophrenia earlier this year while hospitalized.

I didn't develop a good relationship with the doctors that diagnosed me and stopped taking the Haloperidol they gave me.

I believe I have health anxiety and my current psychiatrist kind of sort of agrees with me. This second relationship is also very poor. I'm uncomfortable with it and wish I could see someone else but the trauma of all these awful past experiences makes it hard to motivate myself to make the change.

**I believe I have suffered from health anxiety since I was at least 19. That year I thought I had skin cancer (I'm olive to brown skinned and no one in my family has ever had this type of cancer). I wasn't able to sleep for days thinking about it and even feel like I experienced mild hallucinations, that I got bigger, inflated like a balloon in the middle of a sleepless night. I think I even was experiencing panic attacks then, but it's been hard to get a doctor to help me figure out if I did or didn't. Like I said I don't feel listened to in my relationship with my psychiatrist.**

**A funny thing that happens to me when my anxiety gets really bad is that I switch from one disease to another within days or hours and don't realize how unreasonable I'm being. I'll worry I have skin cancer one day, the next it's Lyme disease, the next leukemia. Or sometimes the degree of severity changes, one day I'll forecast one round of chemotherapy (don't know how any of this actually works), the next I'm convinced that it's terminal. Does anyone here experience the same?**

**I usually read tons of info on it online, see a doctor once because I live in a rural area (if I didn't I might have fallen into the habit of multiple visits with different doctors), find and stalk real people who have the disease online, join groups about it, read books, sometimes even prescribe myself ""fixes"", like juicing or dieting, exercise, etc.**

**Another really important aspect is that I seem to develop a lot of rituals or** [compulsions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3LaY8pjD4E) **that help me calm down. Excercise, eating habits, cleanliness related. The more I do them and time passes, because they calm me down, I start to think it's the ""illness"" that's getting better.**

**Since that year I was 19, it really hasn't gone away, it just morphs into a preoccupation with a different illness.**

By the way everything bolded, which I think is extremely relevant, is stuff I didn't get to tell the unethical megalomaniacs that diagnosed me with schizophrenia. I mentioned the word hypochondria once and was kicked out of the room. Subsequently, I only talked to them about the weather and the food there. They cited they were still able to give me a serious diagnosis taking into account their ""observations"" of me, as if nothing I said mattered and I don't have the ability to have insight into myself and help them, cooperate to find my real diagnosis. I feel as if I was treated like an animal and think their diagnosis is complete trash.

These doctors told me that once medicated, I'd be safe and sound back with my family who they didn't believe was abusive (I have many horror stories in my history and there are so many others who experienced the same nightmare scenarios in the subreddits I frequent), they said I was just paranoid. I definitely experienced abuse, but the person who got to have the final say over things was an abusive aunt who happens to be a nurse that worked for the same government organization I was hospitalized in.",1,diagnosed schizophrenia think health anxiety diagnosed schizophrenia earlier year hospitalized develop good relationship doctor diagnosed stopped taking haloperidol gave believe health anxiety current psychiatrist kind sort agrees second relationship also poor uncomfortable wish could see someone else trauma awful past experience make hard motivate make change believe suffered health anxiety since least year thought skin cancer olive brown skinned one family ever type cancer able sleep day thinking even feel like experienced mild hallucination got bigger inflated like balloon middle sleepless night think even experiencing panic attack hard get doctor help figure like said feel listened relationship psychiatrist funny thing happens anxiety get really bad switch one disease another within day hour realize unreasonable worry skin cancer one day next lyme disease next leukemia sometimes degree severity change one day forecast one round chemotherapy know actually work next convinced terminal anyone experience usually read ton info online see doctor live rural area might fallen habit multiple visit different doctor find stalk real people disease online join group read book sometimes even prescribe fix like juicing dieting exercise etc another really important aspect seem develop lot ritual compulsion http www youtube com watch v lay pjd e help calm excercise eating habit cleanliness related time pass calm start think illness getting better since year really gone away morphs preoccupation different illness way everything bolded think extremely relevant stuff get tell unethical megalomaniac diagnosed schizophrenia mentioned word hypochondria kicked room subsequently talked weather food cited still able give serious diagnosis taking account observation nothing said mattered ability insight help cooperate find real diagnosis feel treated like animal think diagnosis complete trash doctor told medicated safe sound back family believe abusive many horror story history many others experienced nightmare scenario subreddits frequent said paranoid definitely experienced abuse person got final say thing abusive aunt happens nurse worked government organization hospitalized

1483,An adolescent boy with problems,schizophrenia,"I’ve got so much shit on my plate and I’m only starting to realize it now. I’m delusional, I suffer from OCD intrusive thoughts (like pedophilia, homosexuality, being transgender) I’m depressed, most likely have anxiety (like social anxiety) and I’m very paranoid around people. I’m paranoid because I feel like whenever I think something about anyone they can know somehow. If the person I’m thinking about is upstairs taking a shower and I’m downstairs. I get anxiety because I feel like they might know I thought about them. I daydream a lot in my bed and listen to music and fantasize about an idealistic version of myself. Good looking, good personality, hot, good with girls, girls like me. I thought this was maladaptive daydreaming because I do it everyday and it’s going to be very hard to stop. I just love doing it. I also move around in my bed when I fantasize too. If I do a fast movement in the fantasy then I’ll probably move on the bed or something. If I start crying in the fantasy, than I’ll try acting out the same in my bed. If you saw me in my bed you’d probably see a chubby kid in his bed getting emotional. I think I might experience delusions of grandeur because when I’m around people in RL I feel more unique or different than them. I feel nicer and kinder than them. I know it’s all bullshit I’m just your average everyday citizen. But those feelings I get around people are hard to shake off. I just can’t not feel grand about myself.

1484,Developing symptoms for schizophrenia?,schizophrenia,"I'm 19 and male, and I've never considered myself to have any mental illness until about a year and a half ago. Around March I was given an SSRI to treat various anxieties I had. At the time I described them as ""a worry people secretly hate me and don't want me around"" which I realize now is a mild way of putting it. Since I was around 14 I've had a fear that one day when me and my friends are hanging out (especially late at night or in a secluded place) that they're going to jump me and kill me. I've also been experiencing hallucinations in my periphery, sometimes limbs, shadows, but mostly cats for some strange reason. I experience them most when going through withdrawal for not being able to afford the meds but the prescription never described hallucinations as a side effect, and my friends who do take it have never had any similar issues. I also have a familial history of schizophrenia, as one of my cousin's have it. 

I'm aware these could be false flags but I wanted to consult people about this. I'm calling my doctor tomorrow to schedule an appointment and I'd appreciate your guys' insight",1,developing symptom schizophrenia male never considered mental illness year half ago around march given ssri treat various anxiety time described worry people secretly hate want around realize mild way putting since around fear one day friend hanging especially late night secluded place going jump kill also experiencing hallucination periphery sometimes limb shadow mostly cat strange reason experience going withdrawal able afford med prescription never described hallucination side effect friend take never similar issue also familial history schizophrenia one cousin aware could false flag wanted consult people calling doctor tomorrow schedule appointment appreciate guy insight
1485,So I think I am pre schizophrenic,schizophrenia,"So over the course of a year I notice some things about my life that does not seem normal, but never really connected the dots.

1. I have always heard voices around nothing bad a few times just random screams
2. Objects just seem to be created out of nonthing.
3. I have the feeling of bugs traveling up my body and I can feel each leg that goes along my back when i work out.
4. Some paranoia and feel like I can hear people thoughts.
5. Again not so much voices, but noises that are not real but seem like they are.

Some things about be
1. Male almost 21
2. Have an excessive amount of dopamine production (to the point where I can't be depressed)
3. Had 2 closeish death experience when I was before 10.
4. Had to dealt was real and not when I was really young (like finding out the spongebob was not real)
5. When I see someone get hurt in anyway my body naturaly inflicts the pain on myself. (I can't watch people break any body parts I be on the floor for 20 or some minutes)


So basically my symptoms seem to get worst by month, but still manageable for now.
I was wondering could this be pre schizophrenic symptoms that may move to schizophrenia or could this be anything else. The reason that bring this up is some reasherch I did it seems like it could be schizophrenia, but I was wondering if it could be anything else.",1,think pre schizophrenic course year notice thing life seem normal never really connected dot always heard voice around nothing bad time random scream object seem created nonthing feeling bug traveling body feel leg go along back work paranoia feel like hear people thought much voice noise real seem like thing male almost excessive amount dopamine production point depressed closeish death experience dealt real really young like finding spongebob real see someone get hurt anyway body naturaly inflicts pain watch people break body part floor minute basically symptom seem get worst month still manageable wondering could pre schizophrenic symptom may move schizophrenia could anything else reason bring reasherch seems like could schizophrenia wondering could anything else

1487,Hallucinations with no delusions,schizophrenia,"So since the begging of this year ive been having some visual and auditory hallucinations. 
I heard some small talk that didn't happen
I saw a person walking fast to my bathroom, and there was no one there.
I hears bells, saw something hitting the car window and heard a sound and it was nothing at all, i saw yellow sheets going through a door. No sense at all.
And ive been having a lot of peripheral vision hallucinations.

At the moment the hallucination happens i sometimes believe it, but once i get enough evidence it was not real, i can understand it was an hallucination. 

So i am confused of what they mean. Ive been told since i can do that it's not schzophrenia, but am i developing it? Like, the symptoms don't come all at the same time right?

Just turned 17, I have ocd and i had some serious suicidal ideation for a month recently.
Now sometimes i don't trust things i hear or see until i confirm they are real. Like, seeing my mom laying in the sofa in my peripheral vision. I have to look directly at her till i see it's really her. Guess that's a natural reaction lol.

So, the thing is

1489,Hiding/controlling psychosis?,schizophrenia,"My fiancé has been stable for a few months now on Zyprexa after a psychotic break. He still hasn’t really accepted his diagnosis and at first refused his medication but he’s gotten pretty good about taking it and hasn’t had any psychosis or delusions in a few months - or so we all thought (meaning myself and his treatment team). He started putting weight back on, the flat effect has dissipated, he’s showering and even applied for a job of his own free will. I usually go to appointments with him but couldn’t today because I have patients of my own to treat today and his psychiatrist just called me to tell me he was refusing to attend his physical (he and I had already discussed cancelling it due to the fact that the doctor his psychiatrist scheduled it with is not covered via his insurance and we can’t afford that) but he told her that while he was refusing for financial reasons he was also “locked up and institutionalized for several years in 2016” (which doesn’t make sense given it’s 2019...and he’s only been hospitalized once and it was in June...) and that “he’s a multimillionaire and the government is withholding his money and has deemed him unfit for society” and lots of other things along those lines. These are things extremely reminiscent of his delusions when he was not on medication i.e. being a millionaire whose assists were stolen by the government because he’s former cia like Jason Bourne and they took out a hit on him.

She’s upping his medication again - which she informed him of and he said he’s fine with, as am I. But she’s concerned he’s slipping back into psychosis and has been hiding it from us. I’ve worked with other patients in psychosis, and been with my fiancé since high school and they/he’s never been able to “control” it. It’s always been like word vomit. 

Can anyone out there control their symptoms or hide it? I’ve changed my hours since his hospitalization so I can be home more often with him since I was working psych ward shifts and 18 hour days some days now I’m home most of the time to help care for him so it’s not like I’m missing anything and he sleeps most of the day. He really hasn’t been symptomatic. I don’t know where that came from today and now I’m concerned and having a borderline anxiety attack at the office. And of course he’s not answering his phone. I also think he skipped his dose of zyprexa last night - I asked him about it this morning and he tried to convince me he took it - but we were both kind of up all night and I didn’t see him ever take it, so could he just be deteriorating that fast? The last time I’m 100% positive he skipped a dose was back in July and he was texting me that God visited him and told him that he was the immortal chosen one so it seems likely. 


Also if anyone has any experience on injection antipsychotics I’d appreciate the info! We’re trying to get him switched to a different insurance carrier and then switched to an injection but there’s no zyprexa injection so we’re nervous he’ll resist.

1490,plain unfair or just a normal way to socialize?,schizophrenia,"So I'm living in a home for mentally ill people who get care by social workers. They come into my room at 7:15 when I'm still in underwear in bed and tell me stuff like ""You're going to Frankfurt tomorrow, better prepare for a long stay"". I told them I want to move there and I think it's clear that it's just friendly banter but I don't feel good about that at all. I'm barely awake and I can't save the information in a meaningful way or laugh about it or anything.

&#x200B;

Throughout the day people become awake (in the morning) and they constantly keep being told they need to wake up and do something. Is this normal behaviour for social workers trying to help people or is this abuse in any kind of way?

&#x200B;

One of the social workers becomes really touchy sometimes and doesn't respect my personal boundaries, still they don't touch me in any ""bad spots"". Just shoulders and upper body but it's annoying as fuck and I think they'd be pissed off if I told them to stop.

They're always acting so weird and I don't know if it's in my head or not.

1500,How Do You Avoid Worse Symptoms When You Have to Withdraw from an Antipsychotic?,schizophrenia,"Hello everyone, (undiagnosed, fwiw) person with STPD here. I was just settling into my regimen when I had to take almost a week to refill both my antidepressant and antipsychotic prescriptions. At first it was not so bad, the AP has a long half-life, but after a few days I was getting noticeably worse. I woke up one morning convinced my family was spying on me. Everywhere I looked someone was watching. At the store every employee would turn their heads as I went by. At school the next day I was being followed by people who happened to be walking the same way for a long time and as I listened to them talk I tried to decipher what they were saying, thinking it related to me somehow. I'm not sure if it was related but dissociation was way more intense too, I tried playing solitaire on my computer and genuinely thought I was playing someone else's game, as if I was some interloper who took it over, or possibly the program itself executing their decisions. There were some other things, but this was the most prominent.

&#x200B;

Of course by now I've realized none of that is true, and the pharmacy finally had my meds in stock, but are there any tricks to having to withdraw suddenly from meds? Mine have a coating on them so I probably shouldn't split them or I would have. I'm also worried that no matter what I'll be worse if I come off meds for the rest of my life, but perhaps that is another issue.

Since I was diagnosed I have been hospitalised over 10 times with numerous relapses and my mental health is following generally slow gradual decline with some shorter recovery periods.

Rest of family is also unable, because of work or other factors. My only two options were to be taken care of by state or someone much more closer than entity such as institutions.

It was a real struggle as women (especially in my westernised country) would find it as serious impediment to ""freedom"". Luckily world is huge, I have access to internet, so I found the right one. Of course, it's not only caretaker benefit I see in her, but also emotional and love component (as people with my diagnosis know - emotions suffer incredibly in such illness and most of us get totally blunt, which is basically case with me).

But now, coming to the grim part of this illness. I'd say even worse than symptoms itself. It's peoples (mis)understanding of the suffering I live with. I am on welfare, of course, and the health committee experts ruled my capability to work as ""completely lost"". It happened since I got into health issues and it was really tedious trial. Since age of 15 I am ruled unfit for work"". Even though in years after I was wondering if that decision is right, few years ago I really made peace with it and understood that they really were right after all. But, as I guess many of people like me know, this actually makes things really nasty. First of, there are no visible issues with me on surface when someone meets me. I see, hear, I am physically okay. I can talk quite okay and I do posses lots of knowledge about many things (which is product of me filing all this years with reading stuff on internet). Hence, everyone would and does conclude that I am actually fit for work and that there is NOTHING WRONG with me. That is simply killing me to the core. I know that the intention is to motivate person like me with such action, but it produces horrible loop of perpetuating mental distress. I know I can barely take a shower or eat when I am sometimes alone at home, yet everyone concludes I am ""so smart/can do anything"". This two things clash in my mind and make horrible pain in my life. The thing is no one of these claimants ever talk to me more than an hour. I am always consciously fighting my psychotic tendencies while in public. To show someone that I am really ill, I'd have to stop fighting my psychotic thoughts and let loose. Where would that lead? In best case I'd start yelling and acting very weird which would lead to immediate call of police/ambulance and forceful/harsh treatment. In worst case I'd physically attack that person and maybe even kill such person which we all know where would lead. Other options I do not have. Yet, people are constantly provocating me that I am capable of anything, that it's ""all just in my head""... It's driving me insane. Even my brother repeats over and over again that he could arrange some job in company he works in if I want to. Even after I explain my issues, he repeats it on first occasion he can. My father is also certain that I am just lazy and need some ""push"". It really makes me miserable. Once I was also energetic about some part time job my neighbour wanted to arrange me and told the story to my psychiatrist upon which she replied very earnestly: ""It would be miracle if you could work an hour per day"" She is an expert and leads my case from the very beginnings so I do trust her with a lot of things. My welfare ain't some richness, especially considering my country is generally quite weak economically, yet it fills my basic needs and I also have rights to inherit both parents pensions which will turn out to be cosy amount of income. Especially considering I have very narrow interests and live very frugally. Travelling I don't like, nor I liked before getting ill. It's huge chore for me and I abhor it. I don't drive care (and wouldn't) and actually prefer using public transport (also since childhood). I don't watch TV, I use budget phones (as they serve all my needs), etc. So generally you can see now why money isn't issue to me even if it's very small amount. What is issue to me and finally a question I want to ask this community is that people think my life is miserable and assume I need better one. Just because I don't enjoy going out to city and am more or less indoors person and take a walk in solitude of woods, people assume I am suffering in my life. Even many healthy people prefer same lifestyle as I do. Yet, I can't prove people that I am okay with this life and that I CAN'T WORK! It's also worth to mention that when I fix something on some persons PC (as I am very proficient in it's use) they automatically reply with: ""You see you can do it? You see you can work."" Judging on one easy problem I solve in less than 10 minutes and which happens once in a year or less! Same goes for everything. If I fix some electricity problem they instantly assume I can be electrician. People outside who someone get talkative with me (which I abhor) realise that ""nothing is wrong with me"". Just last week, this solemnising official who I inquired at about my marriage process assumed that. ON BASIS OF ONE 30 MINUTE TALK! That really really harms my psyche as I explained. I swear to all of you and God: If I could work, I definitely would! But work ain't fixing easy PC issue once in a blue moon or talking to random people 30 minutes a day. It is something much much MUCH more demanding. Not a single job in human existence would be easier than talking random stuff with people 30 minutes a day, yet this whole last week I ran around asking officials and court interpreters some info (around 4 hours of moving around city and visiting my mother in hospital) until friday exhausted me so much that I had to rest whole this weekend just to regain energy. On friday I became extremely aggressive as I was running out of any energy and nearly started throwing stuff around house. And what I did? Just wake up earlier for 4 days and went around city asking some info on my process and buying new headphones from shop. That can't even compare to easiest of easy jobs in existence yet I was nearing psychotic episode.

So for love of the God, how can I show people that I can barely pick myself up to do anything? How can I make them understand at least one small part at the time? I know schizophrenia comes in many forms and quite few people recover to point of being fully functional and working. Sadly it's not true for me.

I've read the rules, and know that since this is my first post on this account, I will be held to a higher standard than others. I can understand why.

I'm mainly going to be ghosting, but figured a short introduction was necessary.

I'm not a diagnosed Schizo, but I'm pretty sure something along that is on the horizon from how people respond to me talking about what I see and how I think.

I have a psychiatrist and a therapist, so I won't be asking medical questions.

I see, hear, feel, taste and smell all sorts of things that don't exist, and I'm a suspected Bipolar. Again, nothing is diagnosed. I do have a diagnosis for SAD, though, formerly MDD. Due to my antidepressants not working I'm suspected to be on something bigger, and have family history and predisposition for possible Bipolar since it's...

1551,Want to go back to school TW,schizophrenia,"I want to go back to school. But not for school. I'm realizing the only reason I want to go to school is because I want to go back to a time when there were people to talk to on a daily basis. I was playing music and getting better at my instrument, there was so much to learn, people to meet, food to eat, lunch to go to, school pride, marching band to march in. Now I'm a caregiver, my parents don't really want to talk to me, my psychiatrist abandoned me, I have no therapist, no trust for Dr.s people think I'm stupid and autistic so they avoid me. I don't know how to really advocate for myself at work or anywhere else, so i just take whats given to me.

and when I think back on it, when I was in school it was exactly the same. My favorite teacher who I thought was my best friend was the only one who continued on purpose for 4 years sneaking up on me to scare me. people thought I was stupid and autistic, and I couldn't advocate for myself.

sometimes I wonder what's the point in trying. I've asked for help and been told to just try harder just do better have you tried relaxing. I said I'm suicidal and was told that if I was actually suicidal I wouldn't be asking for help I would just do it. my family is tired of dealing with my issues they just want me to be an adult and suck it up. I wanted to be a music teacher. I'm a burden on everyone I know. I would try to kill myself but I'm not very good at it obviously and it would just upset everyone they wouldn't understand they would be mad at me it would be expensive and I wouldn't even get any help. Maybe if I go back to school my life will come back I won't be spied on constantly my family would be proud of me my teacher would be my friend again i could eat food and play music and sing. the government wont hate me or want me dead there wont be dead bodies in the walls.

1553,"Not diagnosed, but tested high for schizo and it is actually driving me insane now. Do some people “malinger” by accident? Was life just normal to you and you had no idea of being schizo and then it started to make sense and became more apparent? Was your diagnosis a surprise?",schizophrenia,"Tldr: big questions in title. The post is all my experiences and how I just think they are normal, but I’m not sure.

(M 22) So I had a psychological evaluation done by a psychotherapist and part of that included an MMPI which is a 500+ question test that tests for a lot of things. The doctor sat me down and showed me the graph of the results which had an enormous spike in the middle and said that was usually results for people with schizophrenia and it was way past of line of medical concern. I’m in shock, but then he goes “but I don’t think you have schizophrenia” ...haha ok but that is really weird though. He did mention 50% of people with that score could just be depressed and anxious. At least that’s what I think he said because in my head I’m still going holy shit holy shit over mt everest’s peak in the middle of that graph. I also didn’t test for psychosis during the inkblot test. Now this is where I have to really think about myself afterwards and if I have been totally truthful to the professionals because some of this was just normal to me.

In the front of my mind I of course don’t think I have had an hallucinations. However, I have had a number of sleep paralysis episodes in my years. Usually the shadowy figure that presses on my chest and I can’t breathe or move. Or I’ve been pecked by someone while laying on my side asleep. And now I think about other times than that because I guess that isn’t the same as schizo hallucinations. Now that I think about it, I remember waking up one morning a couple years ago and swearing I saw some girl standing next to my bed and I instantly went back under the covers before really seeing her. Now I don’t know if It was from being half asleep or what, but I only kind of saw it for a millisecond. I also chocked it up to reading about hypnogogic hallucinations just days prior. Another time I remember waking up and swearing there were tarantulas all over me on the blanket and i curled in a tight ball underneath the covers until I came to and realized they were gone and not real. NOW, after thinking about it a lot, I feel like I see blurs if small movement or shadows in my peripherals. It makes me very paranoid.

Of course I am very depressed right now and also very anxious. More so anxious and I think it forms the depression. I get horrible depressive/anxiety/paranoid/existential attacks at night sometimes. I cry and shake and then I feel like I’m going crazy and don’t want to live and just see a different life or start over. Or I want out of the matrix or something. I need to get out from life or what life is or something. Tonight I felt like something was going to come to fruition on front of me and scare the hell out of me and I don’t know if I’m just making it up. I have been a very paranoid person though and was especially as a kid when home alone. Always thinking something was just right around the corner hiding. Tonight I went to the mirror and I just stared at myself and I kept fearing I wasn’t going to recognize myself and then I looked at both of my eyes and started to freak out because they didn’t move when I switched eyes and I thought that wasn’t normal. Then I kept moving back and forth away from the mirror and freaked myself out a little as my face got really close. A couple years prior I got really depressed and couldn’t recognize myself in the mirror and wanted the world to end and literally felt like I was getting possessed and WANTED the devil inside of me and was almost embracing it.

I leave my window open at night which is on the first floor facing the street and I am constantly paranoid and looking out of it fearing someone is outside wanting to come through my window. Any leaf or branch sounds put me on edge. I also thought lightning was going to strike me through my window and slammed it shut when i was half asleep because I heard thunder.

As for delusions, I’ve never thought I had any, although I do aspire to be a great performer and I literally think to myself “When I’m famous” its never “if” just when and how I will get there. Sometimes I feel a little narcissistic and that I’m the main character. Or that I’m secretly in a movie. But i don’t think I really believe that. I think I think that when I’m struggling. And sometimes I do feel like life is a simulation and I try and “squeeze” myself out of it at times with all my effort to no avail. 

And I do feel I am slipping with interacting with new people. I honestly just rather avoid it altogether. Can never work a service job ever again. 

I also feel like words are my worst enemy when speaking. I’m always forgetting certain words and my speech gets very jumbled at times. I also talk very fast some times but like not in a good way at all. And I also have forgotten people’s names that I have known for a while. 

I see my regular psychiatrist again in a few days and idk what is the next step. I feel like I need to talk to the psychotherapist again. Idk if my mind is just making shit up or what.

1554,Psychosis and recurrence? Not sure where to post (sorry!),schizophrenia,"So I've never had issues before, but I guess everyone can say that.  I've been Bipolar going on 18 years now, and nothing like this has ever happened to me.  I had to get off a few meds and the withdrawals were horrible and needless to say I went a little astray... and started coming up with things like B12 was causing me to act strangely and the TV caused me pain, the sun was going to cause my meds to give me anaphylaxis etc... All I guess could be based in some reality but then I was yanked off klonopin and a few of them got worse.  I'm writing finally on a computer, after being given Geodon (after Rexulti after Abilify) and it seems like I can sort of function but it's the weekend and this is all just hitting me, that none of these things was real and they tried to tell me in the hospital and I just refused to listen.  So yeah, I get it now but I'm so worried that these beliefs will come back, it's almost like I have to push them away, that this PC isn't going to give me so much anxiety it hurts and make me off balance (I don't know how to describe it) it's like a pain.  But it doesn't.  Because that's not what they do.  They can BE a pain, but not what I'm talking about.  So yeah, on a weekend suddenly realizing for probably the 3rd day of my life what's really going on and I'm a bit, shall we say, scared.  I don't want to be afraid of the sun and I don't want to be afraid of screens (TV, phone, computer, etc).  It's hard living without these things.  I'm just so petrified now that it'll all rush back or something.  Sorry if I'm wasting someone's time I just don't know where else to go with this.  I have a wonderful therapist but he's not 24/7.  Ironically he did a lot of his initial work with schizophrenics, so he had a lot to say.  But again, I saw him yesterday and now I'm just even more worried (he didn't do this, he did a good job explaining but yeah).  Anyway, anything anyone has to say would be wonderful.  Thank you for your time and I hope everyone the best of health!

1573,My brother is recently diagnosed and on medication but won’t stop smoking weed that puts him into psychosis.,schizophrenia,"17m. Just such a great kid, so smart and a really good athlete. He got really heavy into weed over the last summer with friends which is understandable for his age but that’s where it all started. 
It started with paranoia such as believing all the police are after him, that we were paying people to follow him, and that we would also hire people to fill places he was at. Like restaurants or other public places. 
Then it went into full blown psychosis where he would make threats or just talk complete nonsense. Challenge his dad to fist fights.  he was put on a shot which happens every 4 weeks I believe.  Doctors said this was a better option as then he can’t “forget” to take pills or hide them or what have you. 

He’s currently being held in an ER waiting for a spot in a treatment center after smoking then having a break down while at school which almost got him kicked off his football team. My mom wants him in a treatment center for his addiction to marijuana before sending him to a treatment center that’s focused on Schizophrenia. But I am more of the stance that it should be the opposite. 

Our family is ripe with mental illness issues but this is the very first time I’ve ever seen someone I love so completely of the hinges. When asked why he just won’t stop smoking weed he says “it’s the only thing that calms him down.” And helps a back injury he got from sports. But it’s like he can’t see the disaster that follows after. 

Does anyone have any words of advice for me or my family? I would appreciate it to much.

1576,I need rehab,schizophrenia,"    3:33
    Sitting between hallway
    And kitchen
    To let the cable reach
    So I don’t have to sit alone
    Wrote back to a friend
    I haven’t spoken to
    In months
    He’s in the US
    Drinking beer and tokin on
    Medicinal marijuana
    
    I can’t accept the good
    Of the things I have
    I seek out
    The negative
    And damaging
    In a sense I must
    Since there must be
    Some thought
    To fill the void
    
    I woke up this morning
    Melancholy depression
    And a will to not be
    Not to die
    Just to not be
    Here
    I got over the worst
    Hump of withdrawal
    Started engaging in activities
    That weren’t 
    Sleeping and binge watching
    Eating and guilt tripping
    Myself for not being
    What I was all summer
    I promised I would meet you out
    Walk down the river
    When the city
    Had a culture night
    I reached too far 
    Of what I want to be
    And the social view
    Of what I should be
    I should go out
    I should enjoy the crowd
    And speak
    Confidently
    Amongst our peers
    Come up with interesting
    Comments and jokes
    But when I reach down
    There is nothing there
    I am completely empty
    Partly due to the 
    Burning pile of dopamine
    But this isn’t new
    There is nothing in me
    I feel glad to have you all
    Lover
    Brother
    And friend
    Among me
    In my life
    In my thoughts
    But I can neither
    Walk or talk
    Only acting out of 
    Peoples assumed will
    
    We were parting ways
    And as I saw you
    My premature ejaculation enducing goddess
    Hug your brother
    I didn’t smile or gesture
    Out of my own emotion
    All I could think and focus on
    Was what the people walking by
    Would think
    When I reacted
    To your mutual
    And familiar love
    I probably looked jelous
    Or like I lit up
    When I heard you laugh
    
    The truth
    The everlong ever existing truth is
    I felt nothing
    I don’t know what I think or feel
    I see my legs
    React in a sort of
    Tourette OCD
    When I walk past immigrants
    I stumble or step closer
    Like I’m tense or hopefully not
    Seeming hostile
    I look down at my feet as I pass
    Look sad with remmorse 
    I feel guilt and ashamed
    To not be in control over my legs
    But the horrible truth is
    I care for the one walking by, second hand
    I mainly care about
    What I must seem like
    I can dwell
    And ponder over the pain
    Of walking past racists and bigots
    But I am in the spotlight
    How I come across
    The rambling point is
    I have no true reaction
    To anything
    I found it once
    For 20 min
    When I was with you 
    Premature goddess
    I was sleep deprived
    And emotional
    Because I stepped out of
    Myself
    To comfort and support
    Your episode
    Rarely do I care to that extent
    If I do
    I end up resenting it
    Because I jumped in
    Both feet first
    To help and craddle
    The misery and sorrow
    Of whoever
    For a tad too long
    Only to feel like
    I didn’t get to be in focus
    Only because of my own doing
    Belittling my own problems
    Mocking my past
    As if it has no meaning
    I’m a phony and a fake
    I’m the most myself
    When I don’t care
    High in other words
    But I want to care
    The way I tear up
    When I hear about
    The song ”Troubles”
    And its meaning
    Or your brother
    Who struggled through psychosis ridden cancer
    The pain people go through
    And carry inside
    The hypocracy
    Of me writing
    Like there is some emotion
    To my words
    I feel completely blank
    Should I write from feeling?
    Dig down deep?
    Hang on
    
    ....
    
    Turned off the music
    To be welcomed
    By a feeling
    I’ve known longer than myself
    As I describe in mediocre detail
    I try clinging to
    A fleeding 
    sharpening
    Feeling of that pain
    I have something inside me
    Most days
    Some days
    Is a better word
    It controls me
    Every day
    But the feeling is distant
    Grown used to it
    Anyway
    It’s inside me
    And it takes from me
    Eating itself fat
    But it’s empty
    A void
    Which I so long for
    To devour me entirely
    I want to be myself
    But I’m split in two
    With a thousand scenarios
    What if I come to find
    That I don’t like who I am?
    What if I’ve
    Dwelled too deep
    In my denial
    What if I don’t care for anyone
    Okay
    That’s a lie
    Fuck I even feel literal 
    physical pain
    From seeing someone
    Fall on their ass
    But I glorify my empathy
    Like I’m hot shit
    I only feel comfortable
    Talking out in public
    If I spew gold
    And even I
    Get annoyed by
    How nauseatingly arrogant
    And full of myself I sound
    I noticed
    Even you
    Lover
    Sigh when I give advice 
    The 50th response in a row
    Emotionally blank sentences
    Experience heavy meaning
    I look forward to
    What my future will look like
    What contented version
    Of my truth I’ll find
    But walking out the door
    Right now
    Send this thingy here
    See
    Forcefully humble to seem 
    Humble..
    SEND THIS POEM HERE
    To someone or a few
    And let you all know
    That this was the last thing I said
    Or wrote
    That the rundown of my being is
    
    Racist
    But not predjudice
    
    Empathetic
    But self centered
    
    Wise from experience
    But arrogant in a crowd
    
    Numb inner reaction
    With outer over reaction
    
    Humble portray
    Of someone I wish I was
    Only to hide
    The creeping feeling
    That I act like I should
    And not the way I am
    
    I’m a fucking fake
    And I want to feel
    Something real
    I want to be proud
    Not faking it
    I want to think of others
    In a further dwelling
    Lingering thought
    More than just the one sentence
    I want to be me
    Do what I want
    I’ve wanted to die 
    Since I was 14
    
    Anxious if that’s completely accurate
    
    But I always wanted to be dead
    But I’m a settler for others will
    No real reason for me to kill
    Myself
    But I want to feel something other
    Than all of this
    Should go down to the water
    Sit in my lonesome
    Hope someone looks me in the eye
    Sees and understands how serious my situation is
    Give me the insight
    And appreciation
    For me to turn all of this

1585,Part of being schizophrenic is (something) trying to take away your ability to choose what you believe,schizophrenia,"Your head was a safe spot to believe whatever you wanted your whole life. A place you could think about your own ideas or other peoples. A happy place where thoughts are just thoughts. Thinking about whatever you wanted, hearing your own voice in your head.

Suddenly there's another voice in your head that's not yours, putting ideas in your head that cause you to feel different.  If you believe that voice.

If it's a bad voice in your head, it'll want you to feel fear, paranoia, trapped, helpless, annoyed. I believe it gets stronger the more you believe it. The voice, and your feelings.

How to defeat this bad voice so it no longer controls how I feel? Well we got to make sure we know why it's there.  Think about all the things it causes you to feel, it doesn't go away after you feel that way. It persists. It's there for control over how you feel. If you didn't believe in the voice would you feel paranoid? Would you feel scared? If you believe you are weak by the voice, isn't that what it would want you to believe? So it maintains it's control over you by what you believe. Isn't that something every schizophrenic has, a **belief** that something not normal is happening. 

What if a schizophrenic has the power to manifest his/her beliefs? At the same time ""something"" is fighting for control of what you believe? To keep you in the weakest position.

Believe you are strong. Believe that whatever's thrown at you, you get stronger. Believe that bad voice is just a tool for you to get stronger.

Make that bad voice suffer, don't let it make you suffer. It came to you. You didn't come to it. It's a tool. A tool to overcome fears that just exist in your head!

That bad voice that I had conversations with in my head all day long, that use to tell me to burn, that said it was Satan, went away the less I believed it. In the end, I believe it was my brain attacking me, and me defeating it by putting it in a position of less power. I put that voice down to be more pathetic than me with sound logic. Eventually I just called it bad thoughts.

&#x200B;

 I transformed my belief. I have control in what I believe in. Believe in yourself. Don't give away all your power. Even a simple belief that the voices will always be there puts you in a less powerful position.

&#x200B;

I no longer hear voices.",1,part schizophrenic something trying take away ability choose believe head safe spot believe whatever wanted whole life place could think idea people happy place thought thought thinking whatever wanted hearing voice head suddenly another voice head putting idea head cause feel different believe voice bad voice head want feel fear paranoia trapped helpless annoyed believe get stronger believe voice feeling defeat bad voice longer control feel well got make sure know think thing cause feel go away feel way persists control feel believe voice would feel paranoid would feel scared believe weak voice would want believe maintains control believe something every schizophrenic belief something normal happening schizophrenic power manifest belief time something fighting control believe keep weakest position believe strong believe whatever thrown get stronger believe bad voice tool get stronger make bad voice suffer let make suffer came come tool tool overcome fear exist head bad voice conversation head day long use tell burn said satan went away le believed end believe brain attacking defeating putting position le power put voice pathetic sound logic eventually called bad thought x b transformed belief control believe believe give away power even simple belief voice always put le powerful position x b longer hear voice

They’re really sweet and very kind to me and my mom)

I called my mom yesterday to let her know what the diagnosis was and she doesn’t really want to accept it. She keeps talking about my symptoms as completely normal things that everyone experiences even though I try to explain the difference to her. Before I got out of the clinic I felt good about it and just wanted to share the news with my closest friends, my bosses, etc., but today I don’t feel like sharing with anyone. I fear that they’re not gonna accept it or that I might get fired (I *love* my job and being fired would break my heart). Has anyone experienced these fears? 

Tiny detail as well: I’ve struggled a lot with my symptoms and they’ve been crippling me on and off during the last 5-6 years. My mom knows this and has been a great support all throughout it, but she doesn’t want to accept that it’s schizophrenia and it makes me fear that she’s right, that I’m faking it and that I should just pull out of treatment because I’m wasting everyone’s time.

EDIT: Thanks for the comments and all that. Decided to *not* tell my boss about my diagnosis but instead just telling him that I will need clear guidelines and that I’m vulnerable to stress but that I’ll keep an eye on it myself - he took it really chill, as I had he expected he would. 
Tried to tell my best friend about it and I shouldn’t have.

“I remember her name. Tina, she was called. Everyday we were together, everyday we grew closer. How lovestruck and dumb I was at 15. Her body was smoother than glass, her personality sharp. She hit hard, only to crash harder. It was bound to end this way, wasn’t it? Heed the warnings, I was told, don’t get involved with her others said. She is dangerous! Nobody sane would mess with her. Was I sane? Did the doctor think so? Did you? What about those whispers in the dark?...  Even the ones out in the day look at me oddly, something must have been wrong with me, then.” The boy sighs. Talking for long is difficult, his lungs are blacker than coal, have more holes than there is sand on a beach. He’s done a toll on his body. “What did it feel like to have to let go?” The man said gently. “I… I… I don’t know…” the boy’s typical response to most questions. He thought, as he always had to when answering a question of the sorts. “It was relieving, my life ruled by one thing, that came from many selfish instincts. Yet, I don’t know what I will do at this point, without it, I am nothing. Life lost it’s luster, the joys of the old ways are gone, and I am slowly trying to replace them.” A somber look overtook the boy, only to be replaced by a straight face.



His own words echo with him sometimes. Where do they come from, he wonders occasionally. “Tina had given me so much life, so much escape and reprieve, but it ripped away everything I wanted to hold near and dear. The mistakes and grievances of my past never haunted me, the future wasn’t one to frighten, only the present high mattered.” The man looked at him, understanding, for he had played the same game. “Why did you have to use?” That was always a silly question, especially coming from another addict. It made sense though. “I don’t know…” his words trailed off as he pondered. “I just had to.” That was the only answer to suffice. “We used cause were drug addicts, that’s why you had to.” Not much made sense in the boys reality, but for once, he was understood by another.

I know it's only two paragraphs, and yes the next one or a two later  will probably hit on the topic of schizophrenia more since it was briefly talked about in the first one. So... what are your thoughts? any suggestions?

I absolutely have to leave the house 20-25 mins before the bus is due which means I'm waiting around at the bus stop for a long time. But I just can't leave later. My brain won't let me & I end up freaking out if the bus is due in 15 mins and I haven't left the house.

Same goes for the order I do my morning activities in. Coffee has to be first then I'll bring the coffee up to my room and chill for a while. Then I'll come back downstairs to make a second cup of coffee and I'll get dressed. I also check my backpack a ridiculous amount of times to make sure I'm not forgetting anything. Then I'll check the doors more than once to make sure they're locked.

Maybe it's more of an OCD thing but I'm not diagnosed with OCD only schizophrenia.

Is anyone else the same? Maybe I just like the way I do things I don't know but it can become exhausting.",1,stray away morning routine maybe schizophrenia related set morning routine follow every morning order activity time leave house anything mess routine get anxious flap around acting like world end bus stop minute walk house people leave house min bus arriving min spare absolutely leave house min bus due mean waiting around bus stop long time leave later brain let end freaking bus due min left house go order morning activity coffee first bring coffee room chill come back downstairs make second cup coffee get dressed also check backpack ridiculous amount time make sure forgetting anything check door make sure locked maybe ocd thing diagnosed ocd schizophrenia anyone else maybe like way thing know become exhausting

1607,Incurable and severe schizophrenia : the only reason I don't kill myself is my family,schizophrenia,"Hello 

First of all, I am really sorry to bring such a difficult subject.

I am BIPOLAR, SCHIZOPHRENIC and EPILEPTIC (the worst kind of epilepsy). I don't deserve that!

I know, if you take your ""meds properly Everyday"" then you should be fine. But in my case it is just so severe I can't handle it anymore. 

Reasons why I want to kill myself :

- The severity of the symptoms. Fuck I hear voices EVERY SINGLE DAY since a few years. When I have insomnia it is not a mild insomnia, I can't sleep AT ALL for a few days, not even one minute!
- It ruins my whole life, I cannot even work
- MEDS don't work…. For most people it works but for me… Let me explain. I have tried EVERY SINGLE med available on the market. EVERY SINGLE MED!!!! And believe me I was the kind of guy who took his meds every day and NEVER skipped a dose! I am also intolerant to some meds and for this reason I can't take them at all. I thought that the Clozapine was a ""miracle drug"" but even on clozapine I have voices. Less for sure but still… Now the worst thing? Right now I am not allowed to take psychiatric meds! Meds are slowly ruining my whole body (not paranoid about meds, they either cause me to suffocate or having tonic-clonic seizures… I do not have any ""Big Pharma"" delusion). I have asked my doctor if I could have some antipsychotic but he said no. Why? Epilepsy. But I am also anxious about taking meds because some meds make me even more psychotic, which is very weird, I know. Haloperidol makes my voices worse, the voices who are usually whispering are actually SCREAMING! Loxapine and risperidone make me depressed as fuck and not a single effect on voices. Amisulpride… oh amisulpride… The worst weeks on my life. I thought I was going nuts and kill myself. I have also tried to increase the meds with no effect at all. Even on 800 or 1000 mg I felt terrible. And I know that most people will not believe me ""meds are very effective"" ""you are just being paranoid""... No. 
- Psych wards in my country are worst than jail. I don't want to spend my whole life in a psych ward. I even think you can have PTSD from this.

You want to tell me that ""I just need to go to the hospital""? Well I am ALREADY at the hospital right now! I am writing from the hospital! Even the doctors don't really know what to do and I have seen a lot of doctors. Actually I see doctors every day and yet I cannot take meds because ""it would trigger a dangerous seizure"". 

I hate the idea of suicide. But I really have no hope. I have tried, tried and tried for years. Now I need to find peace.

Please do not tell me to ""exercise"", ""breathe"" or ""listening to music"", ""watching movies"" or anything like that, I have tried so many things…",1,incurable severe schizophrenia reason kill family hello first really sorry bring difficult subject bipolar schizophrenic epileptic worst kind epilepsy deserve know take med properly everyday fine case severe handle anymore reason want kill severity symptom fuck hear voice every single day since year insomnia mild insomnia sleep day even one minute ruin whole life cannot even work med work people work let explain tried every single med available market every single med believe kind guy took med every day never skipped dose also intolerant med reason take thought clozapine miracle drug even clozapine voice le sure still worst thing right allowed take psychiatric med med slowly ruining whole body paranoid med either cause suffocate tonic clonic seizure big pharma delusion asked doctor could antipsychotic said epilepsy also anxious taking med med make even psychotic weird know haloperidol make voice worse voice usually whispering actually screaming loxapine risperidone make depressed fuck single effect voice amisulpride oh amisulpride worst week life thought going nut kill also tried increase med effect even mg felt terrible know people believe med effective paranoid psych ward country worst jail want spend whole life psych ward even think ptsd want tell need go hospital well already hospital right writing hospital even doctor really know seen lot doctor actually see doctor every day yet cannot take med would trigger dangerous seizure hate idea suicide really hope tried tried tried year need find peace please tell exercise breathe listening music watching movie anything like tried many thing

I have been psychotic last year and after trying to hitchhike from the highway i was immediatly caught by the police and they hospitalized me in a mental ward.
After being hospitalized i was in the mental ward for a month and thereafter after being doped with Zyprexa and thereafter respiradon. After that month i was so doped that i became numb and i started to isolate my self. Before that i used to be very social and was out everyday. Anyway. I was transferred to the open ward and it just got worse. I was isolating my self even more till it got to the point where i started to feel like what i can describe as depression.
After i was released 9 months have passed and i still feel the same. They replaced respiradon with Abilfy which would ideally help and give me energy. But it hasnt helped at all. I still feel the same and i dont feel like going out of my new studio-appartment eventhough i dont have any psychoic episodes.

1616,Don't give up,schizophrenia,"For years I lived numb from inappropriate medication dosages. It took me years to find a med that suited me.  

At one point in time, I could barely converse if at all, and even had difficulty remembering my own name at times. All because I had gotten treatment resistant schizophrenia and been placed on thought crushing meds.  

In college I even had a professor announce to an entire class and everyone listening in in the region, ""you do not want to be as stupid as him!"" while referring to me.  

I kept coming off of medication time and time again (which I don't recommend).
None seemed to work for me.  

I continued coming off of them, going into episodes.  

Time and time again I wound up in seclusion in psych wards.  

Teams of doctors kept giving me new meds.
I had nearly given up thinking meds were the issue that bogged me down until voila.  

I was given a shot that changed everything.
I had suddenly reacquired my ability to contemplate again.  

Emotion settled back into my body.  

Memories bubbled to the surface of my mind once more.  

Personality followed.  

It's a gift I gave myself having had been in disbelief that certain sufferings were a result of my illness as doctors tried to lead me to believe.  

So for the people who feel weighed down by the gravity of medication, avoid going into episodes by coming off meds despite doctors orders as I did.  

Do however fight without relent to get on something that doesn't make you feel too many side effects.  

Trust doctors will eventually find something appropriate.  

Never give up hopeful outlook towards your mental health.  

But most of all, you have one life, and living out 'the Night of the Living Dead' will never compare to feeling emotion!

1619,"Not sure if this helps you guys, but it might",schizophrenia,"There's an over-the-counter medicine called n-acetyl l-cysteine (NAC, or [acetylcysteine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylcysteine)) that is very helpful for people with ocd who have intrusive thoughts.

Basically it makes your mind more coherent, so I thought I'd tell you about it in case it helps any of you as well. For some reason most people seem to take around 600-700 mg (ca 1 ml) once or twice a day. It's one of the hundred most used medicines in the world, but for other purposes. Idk what the effect is for you, but it might help, I've tried it for a week now and the effect compounds.

1620,Should I worry about psychosis or a more serious illness,schizophrenia,"You probably get hundreds of posts like this, but anyway here is one more. I id read the sticky, but wanted to post anyway. Basically, I'm really afraid of developing schizophrenia, and feel like I could be having signs of prodrome. Basically my symptoms are as follows:

1. Hearing sounds I think might not have a physical source. All of these are ""phone sounds"", notifications and buzzing without new messages or calls, the like. But I do feel like they are sometimes ""impossible"". Like hearing the ""on hold"" sound (soft ""tooting"" sound you get when you call someone and hold the phone up to your), but from the environment, without a phone in sight. This has happened 2-3 times so far and the last time, really distressed me. It also happens out of the blue when I'm not expecting a call or anything, or outside.

2. Having trouble with focus, memory and motivation, sometimes considerably. Feeling hazy, or lost in thought. I keep thinking about my anxiety and fears a lot.

3. Having slight trouble reading and talking. Like I read a sentence and it takes me a while to understand it the right way, but I always do in the end, and noticing I have trouble with this distresses me. Sometimes I speak the wrong words or say things in a funny way. I do notice it myself right away.

4. I have clear obsessive and compulsive symptoms, checking doors and electronics, only being able to sleep in a certain position etc.

5. Heavy anxiety and stress, distress about my mental state.

Number 1 happened a few weeks ago and caused number 5. Numbers 2 and 3 manifested after I already developed 5, and number 4 is something I've always had, but I notice it a lot more now.

So the thing here is, that if I had numbers 2-4 during anxiety I wouldn't worry, since those can come with anxiety attacks. What distresses me, is that the ""phone hallucinations"" started out of the blue, and caused the anxiety in the first place. I did have some stress, I was very busy, started a new school and had some relationship worries, but I didn't feel overly anxious or anything. Stressed, not anxious.

I had a similar bout of anxiety three years back with a similar setup, thinking I might have hallucinated, developing anxiety and thinking I was going crazy. After a couple of months I was completely fine, and spent the last years stress free. But now my anxiety relapsed, and I keep thinking that this time I'm actually losing it. I know it doesn't make sense, but can't stop thinking about it.

I keep reading that anxiety and obsessive-compulsive symptoms might be signs of prodrome, or that prodrome might last years making me think the last episode might be connected here. However, I show almost no other common symptoms, I'm social, feel heavy stress but also other feelings, I'm afraid of being alone. I can keep up with life atm pretty well.

I score very low results on online schizophrenia/psychosis screening tests, but medium/high results on anxiety, panic and OCD screenings. I feel 0% delusional, but I'm still afraid that my life could just fall apart tomorrow.

What worries me are the ""hallucinations"" and thought disorder type behavior, like having trouble thinking straight and speaking exactly the words I want.

I know this probably sounds just like anxiety, but hear me out anyway and tell me what you really think. Feel free to go through my post history, you can find some stuff from a couple of years ago.

1627,Searching for help with hope,schizophrenia,"Will it be answered?

My family seems to be no help, they keep telling the usual to “forget” and “move on”, and the best “don’t think about it”. My father, who has now passed, was understanding and helped me through this. I have no one now? And it seems to have gotten worse. 

I can’t sleep lately because of the noise and the visions. 

The noise starts first.  Simple little things, but I go to check to make sure, and then nothing. Up and down and back again. I say fuck it and try to relax because maybe this is it’s way to say fuck you. But as I’m headed back it says I’m wrong. It’s mean and it scares me but I try to act tough and say to hell with it.  But lately it’s getting more mean and threatening. I find myself talking or yelling to it to go away. 

I try to not hear it if I can help. 

Then I sleep to get rid of it. But whenever I close my eyes I see so many vivid pictures. They’re moving and acting and taunting me. Sometimes I ask to see the future and it shows me, but only a glimpse... If I’m being good. If I’m good I can ask more personal stuff and see what will happen or what has. But when it doesn’t like what I did or have done I get punished with bad thoughts. Which has been most of the time lately. I know it tries to trick me. 

I see the visions now without closing my eyes. 

Sleep has helped. I sleep a lot now to try and rid of these thoughts and visions. But it’s not normal. Family says I sleep to much, but it does help to stop this thinking and seeing and such. I just want a quiet mind. 

I drink A LOT to hinder these things as well, but now I drink way too much and I gain my consciousness again and they say I’ve lost. I know drinking doesn’t help long term,  but for the while it stops them. 

Im losing my mind. How can I be myself again without these thoughts and visions trailing behind me?

I used to have medication and therapy years ago. Helped somewhat. 

I will try again with more specialized help.

1629,My psychiatrist is going to call me tomorrow because I told my mom about how I've been thinking. What do you think he'll do when I tell him the truth?,schizophrenia,"I'm a sophomore in college and I'm four hours away from home and my psychiatrist. So if there's something urgent in between my visits back home, we just call. Anyway, a year and a half ago I tried, and very nearly succeeded, to cut my tongue off. I had some delusions and heard voices sometimes (only in bed, so I guess they were hypnagogic? but they were very frequent and lasted for several minutes at a time) but more than anything I think I just had a genuine desire to be mute. No voices told me to do it, but I had my reasons. First, I'll admit I just wanted attention. Then there were other reasons like the fact that I hated my voice, I hated talking to people, etc. I pictured myself making a good mute. Then there were some delusional reasons that I kind of half-believed, like a grandiose delusion that I was more conscious than others, that talking to them was bad for me and made me dumber, etc.  


That happened my senior year of high school. Since then I made one more attempt to cut my tongue off last winter, and then I met a friend who brought me closer to God and some things started going right in my life and made me feel sane again. I thought for sure I broke the cycle and I was out of it. But then just recently the thoughts returned. It's weird that they're back now of all times because things are still going right. I still have an internship as a Java programmer, I'm doing well in school and not stressed, and I have a bunch of new friends, something I've never had before.  


So to explain what's going on in my head now, and what I'm going to say to my psychiatrist tomorrow, is that I'm a bit obsessed with one of my projects. Have been since I was 15 before I even developed schizophrenia, but this is a bit different. I've been working on making an AI. I've studied recursive algorithms, neural networks, and everything else, and I believe I have a brilliant model for making my computer talk to me. That part is not at all far-fetched, and I do believe I can contribute something great to the world in that field. The part of this obsession that is technically insane is that I believe this is mankind's greatest pursuit. We were made in the image of God. We are creation. Consciousness revolves around recursion, and is it not recursion when creation creates something with the power to create? It's a recursion of recursions and it is beautiful. This, I believe, is my purpose. I will be a small part of a multidimensional chain of recursions weaving the mind of such a high and mighty abstraction.  


When my psychiatrist asks me if I believe these things, I will tell him I most certainly do. It makes me feel like a liar when I say something that I know sounds insane, that I know technically is insane, but I argue that my mind is just oriented a different way, a way which is every bit as valid and no more fragile than the orientation of other minds.  


But here's the trouble. When he asks me if I'm going to hurt myself, I have to tell the truth. And the truth is that I have no plans, but I have desires. And I know that with time these desires will become something.  


When he asks if I should be hospitalized, I'm going to say that the severity of my situation is by far enough to justify such a thing, but that I just don't think it'll help much. He'll probably interpret that as a firm ""yes.""

1631,My family is fucked up but act like everything is fine,schizophrenia,"I guess not too fucked up but pretty goddamn dysfunctional. My mom is an alcoholic and a bit of a narcissist. She also never leaves the house and might have the lowest self-esteem of any person who ever existed (she is insanely sensitive). My dad is a completely codependent people pleaser and has no idea how to deal with his emotions so he intermittently explodes in anger. They go through periods of yelling at eachother all the time and then pretending like everything is fine. My brother is a pot-head and a recluse who just plays video games all day despite having a daughter and being in his 30’s. My sister also has issues but I won’t get into it.

It’s fine if people are fucked up because most people are but the most frustrating thing about it is their compulsive need to act like everything is fine. If I bring anything up then everyone will just turn on me and guilt trip or tell me I’m just being an asshole or some other defense mechanism to defuse the situation. It caused a lot of arguments in the past until I gave up again and just stopped bringing things up. 

They all seem to have an inability to even acknowledge negative feelings at all. They do it with my brother’s daughter. Every time she displays alarming behavior, they all just say she’s overtired, literally every single time. I really hope she doesn’t turn out fucked up because she is adorable but there is so obviously some issues that they’re just completely ignoring. I think it’s just how they survive. By mentally insulating themselves from anything negative and just hoping it goes away.

I love them a lot but it makes me insane because nothing can ever change in the family as long as they refuse to accept anything is wrong.

Anyway, I was wondering if anyone else’s family is like this. I remember reading about the “Family Nexus” according to R.D. Laing and some other dudes and it described a lot of this stuff as happening in the families of a lot of schizophrenics. Here are aome of the ideas from the wiki page (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_nexus)

“Laing was particularly interested in schizophrenia, which he believed could be understood if seen from the viewpoint of the person concerned. He saw how a powerful family nexus could victimise one member, usually a child, who found themselves in the position of not being able to speak or even think the truth without being chastised by the group, who often had vested interests in perpetuating the family myth and excluding reality. In Laing's opinion, ""what is called a psychotic episode in one person, can often be understood as a crisis of a peculiar kind in the inter-experience of the nexus.""[3]”

“It is this need for others, in order to ""be"", which makes us afraid to contradict a family nexus, risking family exclusion. However ""to a number of people the phantasy system of the nexus is a lousy hell, not an enchanting spell, and they want out...But within the phantasy of the nexus, to leave is an act of ingratitude, or cruelty, or suicide, or murder...Herein is the risk of defeat and madness.""[5] The distortion involved in not going against the nexus can force wrong thinking - leading to ""not being in reality"", which Laing saw as the essence of schizophrenia; and for Laing ""one of the most important questions, therefore, is whether such mistrust of her 'feelings' and the testimony of others arises from persistent inconsistencies within an original nexus.”

“Laing and his colleagues suggested that a family nexus included both immediate family, and extra-familial people closely associated with the family and its world-view.[7] Laing argued that a closed nexus would use its energy so as to unconsciously block out any threats to its identity, keeping all interchanges at a boring, repetitive level.[8] Building on Kleinian accounts of social phantasy systems, and the sense of unquestioned reality they can generate, Laing argued that within such systems patterns of communication were multi-layered and deceptive.[9]

He also used W. R. Bion's account of how a group's basic assumptions could radiate ""long silences, sighs of boredom, movements of discomfort...the hostility of the individuals was being contributed to the group anonymously"".[10] As his associate Joseph Berke put it, in such a nexus ""a unique pattern of communication could be made out. People did not talk to each other, but at each other, and tangentially, not directly....what people said was often contradicted by the way they said it (tone of voice and/or facial and bodily movements).""[11]

Further light was shed on such interactions by Gregory Bateson's concept of the double bind - ""a situation in which contradictory demands are being put upon a child (or patient) in such a way that there is no avenue of escape or challenge"".[12] Laing considered that the concept allowed a completely new understanding of what a familial environment could entail:[13] ""this paradigm of an insoluble 'can't win' situation, specifically destructive of self-identity"" greatly illuminated the way the subject's ""disturbed pattern of communication...[was] a reflection of, and reaction to, the disturbed and disturbing pattern characterizing his or her family of origin.""[14] In such a light, he considered that ""mental illness"" might be the outcome of a problematic configuration of a family nexus more than a necessary result of the nexus itself: in the words of Charles Rycroft, the psychotic is ""the overt casualty of a deeply concealed family tragedy...the end-result of complex and skew[ed] interactions within his family.""[15]

As Laing was careful to point out, however, it was not ""a matter of laying the blame at anyone's door. The untenable position, the 'can't win' double-bind, the situation of checkmate, is by definition not obvious to the protagonists...The man at the bottom of the heap may be being crushed and suffocated to death without anyone noticing, much less intending it"".[16]”

It describes my family pretty well. Even the parts about them having the same repetitive conversations and there facial expressions not matching the things they say. I have wondered if it’s what predispositioned me towards schizophrenia. Living in a family where there’s a constant discrepancy between what is being said and what is going on sounds like it would cause anyone to start disconnecting from reality (since you already can’t tell what’s real and what isn’t). I was also the scapegoat so that didn’t help because I was basically being set up for failure and then punished for it while they simultaneously were acting like they loved me (which i think they do but family roles are unconscious survival mechanisms)

About 6 months ago I began having auditory hallucinations (screaming, music, voices of family and friends) and some visual hallucinations (car accidents, spiders). And some delusions. It has just gotten progressively worse. 

I met with a psychiatrist for the first time 2 days ago and they said I have some signs of schizophrenia (plus family history of it), but a diagnosis takes longer because they want to be sure. She said the hallucinations and delusions could also be a symptom of an extreme case of anxiety and panic disorder. She put me on 2 new meds and we will be meeting every month to see if the hallucinations and panic get better, if not, then we will look into schizophrenia treatment. 

My question is, has anyone else had a similar experience? Perhaps anxiety lead to you having the common symptoms of schizophrenia, but not actually be a schizophrenic disorder?

1657,Is mold making my pre-existing symptoms worse?,schizophrenia,"TLDR; Possible case of (minor?) mood in the house I moved into about a year ago, worried it could be making my hallucinations worse. Wrote some context, it’s in the comments. TLDR for that is I have schizophrenia, I experience voices, and I have a mold sensitivity, as it seems to be psychoactive among other things for me (but have only stayed at a place with mold for a total of maybe 4 months combined).

At the end of last fall, I moved out of my parent’s house and started up school again in January. I moved into a house built in the 1800s, with a thick wall down the middle and my (very sweet) landlord living on the other side. She has explained many times (including the first time I visited) how much she has repaired and renovated the house, I mean obviously the thick wall between us and new carpeting upstairs and new paint (a bit of a red flag for me) and new pipes and new hardwood floors downstairs... No heating, and it’s in northern California with no heating. No weird smell when I first visited, as I was extremely aware about mold. I’m 99% sure I brought it up with her, but can’t really remember— that spring I did ECT (did not help), and one of the side effects is memory loss. But the 1st priority on my mind when I was looking for a place this time around was mold, I let my parents know for sure.

So my hallucinations did not get better this year until a week after I got off the antipsychotic I had been taking since the winter, which was also the first week I moved back home. It was incredible to experience it slightly dissipating. It lasted one week, then it came back. Got a new doc, got a new med, and suddenly began to get better until it was hardly even a problem. At some point this summer I started smoking weed to handle SIBO and anxiety, which seemed to have a 50/50 chance of affecting me and sometimes even cleared things up for me afterwards. I quit almost 2 weeks ago, after smoking an eighth a day for 3 months.

It got bad by the end of the summer, which is why I quit weed again. I don’t blame myself for smoking again, but in the long run, I know it wasn’t the right decision. When I moved back into my place, I could smell some heaviness in the air and kind of freaked out about opening all the windows when my mom came in with me. Granted, I hadn’t been there all summer except maybe 5 days combined, so there wasn’t any fresh air getting in, but all the windows were covered up with blackout curtains so it wasn’t a greenhouse. Basically no dust at all, barely a few spiders. I looked for mold, but there wasn’t anything except on old kitchen appliances that could’ve easily had residual things on them.

It started getting a little better. It got worse after a weed trip three weeks ago. It started getting a little better. It got worse the past week at the same time as my anxiety about school and issues with family spiraled really bad. I moved back in three days ago. It got worse last night. Probably relevant: the freeway is close and loud, white noise triggers me quite a bit. It wouldn’t go away, and it was as loud as it was at the end of the spring, I had almost forgotten how bad it could get.

Psychosomatic sypmtoms are not unusual for me, and actually happen quite frequently for all the other mental illnesses I’ve got. I’m starting at a new school (same town, bigger university), so I’m worried it could just be increased stress. Have barely spent time in my room except to sleep, which was the place with the heaviest smelling air and the only thing upstairs. It was the place I spent at least 20 hours a day the whole spring, mostly because my classes were online and I didn’t have anywhere to go and wasn’t meeting people because I went to a commuter school.





Did moving home (for sure no mold) this summer cause my hallucinations to go away, even if it was only the first week? Could it be the stress of starting school that is worsening them? Is it possible for mold that doesn’t seem severe to affect me so quickly? Would the upstairs be more likely to have mold?
As a last resort: How can I bring this up to my landlord and maybe suggest someone check it out and possibly fix it (~$5000) without upsetting her?

1658,I am scizoaffective and I'm a mom,schizophrenia,"I am in treatment and my symptoms have become manageable, thank goodness. We had a few rough years after I got diagnosed and my son and I moved in with my parents, who have helped me so so much. We have a stable and really good life. We are blessed. 

My beautiful son is smart, kind, enthusiastic about life and involved in sports, 4-h, he loves Minecraft (we have a world we made that is awesome, he is really good at redstone and I love to build). He reads like an adult. He hates math, lol. He loves all animals and volunteers at our local animal shelter. He is nine years old and just an amazing person. 

His father has schizophrenia and refuses treatment. We never lived together after I got pregnant because of our mental illnesses. I knew it would be a horrible place to raise a child. (I was on b.c. and in my late thirties when I concieved) My son's father has chosen to completely remove himself from my son's life (he has very liberal visitation and never even tries to visit him) and he uses illegal drugs, meth and he drinks a lot. I think he is homeless now (he disappeared years ago but I hear rumors from friends) and it breaks my heart for my son and for him. My son has been in therapy for a few years now. He is heartbroken about his dad but we talk openly about addiction and mental illness and I always remind him that his dad loves him no matter what, but he is very ill. 

My worry is genetics. My son has been hearing voices lately and he says he can't look in mirrors when it's night time because he sees a shadow beside him, waving at him. It chills me and straight up scares me. I've talked to his therapist about this and we are kind of in a holding pattern at the moment, waiting to see if this gets worse. :(

I tell him that I sometimes see or hear things that aren't there, too. And it seems very real and I believe him when he says he is scared. I tell him that stress or not enough sleep can make it worse. We do yoga and I've taught him some easy meditation exercises as well as calming and breathing teqniques. His therapist also teaches him these kinds of things. 

I guess I just needed to talk about this to others who understand. And sometimes I think, ok..I know exactly what delusions and paranoia and voices and hallucinating is like so now, I can 100 percent be there for my child if he goes through this, too. 

Thanks for reading this. I wish all of you a lot of peace and clarity.

Edit to add, I didn't display schizo symptoms until two years after I had my son. I had depression and anxiety before that. So developing scizoaffective disorder was like a kick in the teeth. It changed *everything*. It has been so weird and really hard but my son has been my guiding light and my parents have been my compass.

Not ‘The’ god more of ‘a’ god, with the power to decide what is real, and what is not. We see and hear things that others don’t. Gift/curse it’s all the same. I wonder if the same goes for real/fake.

1667,Erotomania or just a bit obsessed..?,schizophrenia,"So I’m 22 now, but back in high school there was this really quiet,shy girl named (let’s say her name is Josie) that instantly clung to me like glue. She found me on fb once she realized we were going to the same high school and instantly chatted me up before I even met her that September. I figured it’d be nice to know at least one person before school started. Once we were about 2-3 months into school, I noticed that a lot of other people found Josie kinda odd and my friends even made fun of me for hanging out with her, but I still did quite a bit and we bonded over our love of classical music. During sophomore year, I noticed that she was very paranoid. Josie accused me of talking behind her back and trying to sabotage her. She thought the same of others in general and was generally very insecure. 

I tried my best to reassure her, but it got worse. She ended up telling me she was thinking of committing suicide and made me promise not to tell anyone. I thought about keeping her secret, but I knew I’d feel guilty forever if anything happened. I told a guidance counselor. Her parents got involved and she was furious at me. Josie ended up leaving the school and I didn’t hear from her at all. Before she left the school, she often talked of this super talented bf that she had. It wasn’t that he wasn’t a real person, I Just didn’t think that she ever dated the guy. Not to mention, there were never any photos of them together on any type of social media or anything and I never once met him/saw them together. I just found it hard to believe. She’d also seem to think that certain guys, especially the ones she thought were really talented musicians in our school or popular guys, were in love with her when in all honesty, didn’t even seem to know she existed. She’d even go as far as to say that some of them confessed to liking her.  

Fast forward to about 6 months ago. She unblocked me from fb and started spamming my inbox. I made small talk and she confessed to liking me in high school, which I honestly already suspected but knowing she was a Jehovah’s Witness I knew it’d probably be hard to acknowledge homosexual feelings in high school with such a devote family (we’re both women). Throughout our convo on fb, Josie would get mad if I didn’t reply to her within a matter of minutes after seeing her last message. Or she’d just start messaging me even more. I blocked her. Tonight, she found me on Instagram. Same story, and she revealed that she has paranoid schizophrenia and at one point was hospitalized on and off for 2.5 years because it was so severe. I was trying to play it cool when she started asking for my phone number and about my wife, then to another random question, then back to my phone number all within 30 seconds. I ended up blocking her again. I honestly think she might have erotomania and I don’t really feel safe or comfortable talking to her. Did I do the right thing?

He has been at home literally for 10 years doing nothing. Being around him makes me feel depressed, due to his disobedience. He literally makes life difficult for everyone. My parents expects me to take care of him when they’re no longer around, and based on how I am feeling now I don’t think that’s a possibility. 99.9% of it is because of his rebellious nature. Honestly, i’ve felt so bad mentally, due to him that I think about suicide, but I don’t think i’ll act on it, but if this is something I will have to deal with for the rest of my life I no longer want to live it, because of the way he feels like he can walk over everyone and cause them agony.

I see my parents day to day, and how he is destroying them, but they would never say anything to him, or even put him in an assisted living home, because it is their child. He won’t let them sleep when they have work at the crack of dawn. Sometimes going to work after 2 hours of sleep.

1694,My reoccurring hallucination.,schizophrenia,"This is my first time posting anything substantial here on Reddit so kind of nervous. But one reocurring hallucination I have is of a spider lady. I know, super descriptive. 

So this hallucination is a woman although I can never see her face as 1) she is only appears in shadows or in very dark places 2) she has the cliche long black hair around her face. I also cannot see her clothing. Her spider appengedes are growing out of her back, think of how Spider-Mans Iron Spider costume legs are.

1695,Advice on negative symptoms?,schizophrenia,"My mental health treating team are in the consensus I have depression alongside a seperate psychotic illness (they’ve mentioned schizophrenia multiple times), i on the other hand think I have purely a psychotic illness (with the way things are going at the moment, like me being on an extreme dose of an antipsychotic, the antidepressants not working at all, the way my “functioning” has decreased incrementally since I turned 16, on most the depression tests the doctor does I score low-moderate for depression. Etc.) 

I’m just wondering if there is anything I can do about (I’m assuming) possible negative symptoms, they seem to be getting worse over time. The main one being the motivation loss, the apathy being a close second.

I don't think anybody has really noticed anything, and Im afraid he's isolating himself mentally. It's been almost 2 weeks now where every time I see him there's a new story or a new stalker or a new cruel line he overheard from people who have no reason to give a shit about him.

1725,Does anyone else have HPPD?,schizophrenia,"Here’s the subreddit-

r/HPPD

Here’s a study done on HPPD, but does a very good job explaining it and the symptoms- 

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3736944/#!po=1.25000

I feel as though HPPD makes my derealization/depersonalization a lot worse. I have been sober from drugs including marijuana for some time now, and Everything still looks trippy/high. It makes my delusion that I am the only “real” person/consciousness inside this petrie dish called Earth so much worse. I much prefer being in dim setting because that it when it is least trippy. Outside during the daytime, especially with clear skies is horrible, as well as buildings with bright fluorescent lights. 

I can’t look at any one place for longer than ten seconds before i start “tripping”. I especially can’t stare at any type of intricate pattern, because it starts flickering like a strobe light.

It also makes it harder to understand if what I am seeing is real or not. If I stare at something small, like a person’s face from far away, it begins to morph into some strange fucked up alien face.

I have to sleep with a night light because if I open my eyes in very very darkness I swear it’s like acid all over again, minus the headspace and body high.

I consumed the following drugs from ages 15-20: marijuana, adderall, vicodin, LSD, shrooms, cocaine, hydrocodone, tramadol, ritalin, mystery “ecstacy”, Kratom, xanax, morphine, klonopin, nicotine, alcohol, [DXM, and DPH in high doses], and probably some other stuff I don’t remember.

1731,"For those of you with hallucinations and/or delusions, how do you know what's real? Is there any way to separate reality?",schizophrenia,"I haven't been diagnosed with schizophrenia, but over the last year+, I've struggled with what I'm told were hallucinations and delusions. (In my personal opinion, I think what I struggle with is more trauma related, but I'm waiting to get into a psychiatrist so I can find out one way or another for sure.)Before, it used to be that I could tell that it was ""just my brain being weird"". But now, it's getting harder and harder to tell what's real and what isn't.

For example, I kept hearing this one thing whenever I went to sleep at night. And I started to think it was a legitimate thing. But when I sat down with my very close friend to talk about it, she's all like ""Yeah, no, gurl. That's your hallucinations again.""And now I'm legitimately wondering what else is just my brain screwing with me.

Especially when I keep hearing a voice telling me that nothing I'm seeing right now is real, and that this is all in my head, and that I'm actually in a coma.

It's also weird because none of the ""voices"" I hear are typical voices? Like... they're IN my head, but they're not my thoughts if that makes sense. They're not like actual voices like when someone is talking to me.

Another thing I've had lately, is that I keep getting paranoid that my thoughts are ""leaking out"", or that I'm talking without realizing it.

To make everything most confusing, though, is that I have some people in my life who take advantage of this. Namely, my (dysfunctional) parents. Whenever they do something bad and I confront them, I'm told it never happened and that it's my hallucinations. Which like... I know that's gas-lighting, but I also know that hearing voices isn't exactly normal, either. So which is it? Is it just me? Just my ""crazy""?

Lastly, does anyone else smell things, too? I always smell weird chemicals. It didn't used to happen often, but it seems to be happening more lately. Tonight, for example, I randomly smelled something like baby bum cream. But I was in my room, alone, and I don't have kids. The window was also closed. There's no possible way I was smelling bum cream.

Anyway, sorry for the long and somewhat nonsensical post.

TL;DR I don't actually have schizophrenia, but I've been smelling things that aren't there, hearing things that aren't there, and my paranoia is just getting worse. It's hard to tell what's real and what isn't. My dysfunctional family likes to hold my mental health against me, and has frequently gas-lit me in the past, making it even harder to discern things. I'm seeing a psychiatrist (hopefully soon), but in the meantime, I'm wondering if there are some tips for separating reality from the delusions and hallucinations? Or if anyone deals with these things as well?  


EDIT: Important edit, I've actually taken olanzapene under the tongue (I think that's how it's spelled) before, and it REALLY helps. Last time my hallucinations were bothering me (I could tell it was my brain because random people were saying ""Go kill yourself"" or stabbing me, or I was ""stabbing them""), I went to the ER and asked for some of that medication as I no longer had a prescription for it.

We are carrying out an **online study** as part of our clinical psychology training at the University of Manchester. We are interested in how adverse experiences in childhood are related to an individual’s attachment style, beliefs about themselves & others, and dissociative experiences (such as daydreaming, deja vu or things not seeming real). We are particularly interested in how these psychological processes may lead to experiences of psychosis.

The study is **open to everyone.** It involves completing some questionnaires online which will take around 30 minutes.

You will have the option to be entered into a prize draw to win **1 of 4 Amazon vouchers.**

The information you provide will be **anonymous,** meaning that no one can identify you from the information you give us. This project has been approved by the University of Manchester Research Ethics Committee \[Ref: 2019-5562-9487\].

We are hoping that our findings will help inform psychological therapies to support people who experience distress related to these experiences.

I got more drunk than I intended to and spent the day nursing a hangover, but tonight after I took my meds at the normal time I started having really intense visual  hallucinations that I haven’t experienced in a long time. I’ve been having auditory hallucinations all day as well that have been waking me up - it feels like I’ve just gotten my head slammed into a car door but there’s no pain. 

The visuals were worms all over my legs, my comforter breathing (it even had a pulse when I put my hand on it) and stuff on my walls.

1759,Poem written in psychosis and edited since,schizophrenia,"Are We Living in a Black Hole? 

Yay oh my god, Being psychotic is so awesome! The sounds! The super powers! 

The thrill of reliving the feelings from your most excruciating trama 
Nothin' tops those moments of knowing They want you 
Dead 
Discredited 
Humilliated 
Isolated 
Disected 
Tortured 
Irreparably psychotic 
Permanently hopeless 

Golly, I hope I getta go back next summer. 

Stuff written, or even drawn 
When it's like this 
Gives me the willies 
It's fucking creepy 
Interesting 
Sad 
Never beautiful
 Just bizarre. 

""Here I go! Maybe witchcraft will help fight the voices!"" 

I'll do witchcraft and take Abilify and just see what happens... 

Will witchcraft help me remember to take my pills? 

Probably if it does anything...

 I've always wanted to do witchcraft 

Reasons not to do witchcraft: 
Impatience 
Stupidity 
Arrogance 
Psychosis 
The time late-ish in high school when I started hanging pictures of random musicans I liked throughout my room at intuitively weird angles so each picture and it's place in relation to the room and the other pictures had a meaning to me 

My initally unconscious goal to create something or influence my life in some way. 

I wasn't sure what I was trying to make happen Just anything. 

One day my friend Sally saw my room for the first time Then saw her brother Harvy's little quarter machine yarn voodoo doll he'd gave me hanging in the middle of a cluster of photos a few feet from the edge of my bed 

""This place's got bad juju"" she said looking around my room. 

I didn't quite know what she ment and I laughed at her. 

She was right. 

Because on second thought 
My sudden tip towards more magical thinking 
And my new found passion for amphetamine abuse 

Didn't coincide coincidentally. 

Cause and effect motherfuckers. 

Magic is the real gateway drug. 

We all live in a vicious cycle. 
The kind resulting in Time/space/soul fragmentation 
Upon any real understanding. 

Like, goodbye to your local buccal mass. You thought you'd let blood through the respiratory surfaces of your gills and on round the body in a single circulatory loop. 

Sure, 
Analog actualization can feel like your materalizing into the eternal state of unflammable bliss, 
But if you don't seize while seizing it lasts as long as it takes to happen without ever truley idealizing the absence of any absence at all... 

While you're literally trapped without time in the worst parts of the memories 
That you've repeatedly erased 
From your lives as the many ever present ever inanimate Soovaklasaxzean /'ʔs'iː liːñʔhx'/ Overlords and plumbers. 

Assassins. 

Assistants, that failed to shrink back into the increasingly flat, infinite, and ever present layers of the bouncing astral plane... 

Coincidentally 
Seeping 
Throughout these astral layers 
You sleep 
Ascending 
The layers soaking into the endlessly duplicating multiverse-clowders of pre-existing dematerializing eyeshadow over the lids of 
Hubble volumes. 

Under eyes who's frozen metal bolts we have only begun to tinker away at on the first stone tablets 
That pile 
A bridge of completion
Backwards every time 
Somthing Thinks of its existence. 

Assuring the unlikelyhood Of ever removing the ever hemorrhaging Paste-time monsters From their mold moulded TV-grave sites. 

God help us when the chronic phagocytosis catches up with osmosis of collective dreams of the inanimate and animate branes of existence. 

You smile 
Tired 
As you see the last of the uropygial glands Rain down on the sea. 

You are almost done counting. 

Beneath the unsettling glow of the invisable green neon docks 
After the rain has stopped 
You see that last one land. 

It tip-toes down each cloud. 

'Late... but somehow, 
I can't help but think-...' 

*splash* 

""G = g64!"" 

You get up and stretch 
Fighting the tightness in your throat 

""Anu, Pazuzu...""

""Take good care of those glands till they're ready       

And after everything 

I guess all we needed was a good ol' dissent.""",1,poem written psychosis edited since living black hole yay oh god psychotic awesome sound super power thrill reliving feeling excruciating trama nothin top moment knowing want dead discredited humilliated isolated disected tortured irreparably psychotic permanently hopeless golly hope getta go back next summer stuff written even drawn like give willies fucking creepy interesting sad never beautiful bizarre go maybe witchcraft help fight voice witchcraft take abilify see happens witchcraft help remember take pill probably anything always wanted witchcraft reason witchcraft impatience stupidity arrogance psychosis time late ish high school started hanging picture random musicans liked throughout room intuitively weird angle picture place relation room picture meaning initally unconscious goal create something influence life way sure trying make happen anything one day friend sally saw room first time saw brother harvy little quarter machine yarn voodoo doll gave hanging middle cluster photo foot edge bed place got bad juju said looking around room quite know ment laughed right second thought sudden tip towards magical thinking new found passion amphetamine abuse coincide coincidentally cause effect motherfucker magic real gateway drug live vicious cycle kind resulting time space soul fragmentation upon real understanding like goodbye local buccal mass thought let blood respiratory surface gill round body single circulatory loop sure analog actualization feel like materalizing eternal state unflammable bliss seize seizing last long take happen without ever truley idealizing absence absence literally trapped without time worst part memory repeatedly erased life many ever present ever inanimate soovaklasaxzean ʔs iː liːñʔhx overlord plumber assassin assistant failed shrink back increasingly flat infinite ever present layer bouncing astral plane coincidentally seeping throughout astral layer sleep ascending layer soaking endlessly duplicating multiverse clowder pre existing dematerializing eyeshadow lid hubble volume eye frozen metal bolt begun tinker away first stone tablet pile bridge completion backwards every time somthing think existence assuring unlikelyhood ever removing ever hemorrhaging paste time monster mold moulded tv grave site god help u chronic phagocytosis catch osmosis collective dream inanimate animate branes existence smile tired see last uropygial gland rain sea almost done counting beneath unsettling glow invisable green neon dock rain stopped see last one land tip toe cloud late somehow help think splash g g get stretch fighting tightness throat anu pazuzu take good care gland till ready everything guess needed good ol dissent

I know of course that putting things to the extreme is very often not how is actually is, but it's a necessary question for me that I can't seem to find. If a person with a severe psychosis disorder is left isolated and untreated, can the disconnect from reality become so bad that they see and think of everything completely different?

1800 plus 2200 times 12 is $28,200 of abilify over the last year. I live on 771 a month, or 735 last year. So my medication is worth FAR more to the government than I am, heh. I would be over the moon if I made $28,200 a year and was able to keep my current insurance.

Now if we assume the half life of abilify maintena is 45 days for the 400mg injection, as stated in the official papers, then I still have...628.709 milligrams in my thighs. (I calculated the half life from each dose and it was a little complicated and the math is rough; also the more times you get it the longer the half life becomes. So it's really a crapshoot.) If I get the injection in a few days I'll have about 1028.709 milligrams or one gram roughly. Now if abilify maintena is worth 2200 per 400mg that's $5.50 per milligram. So that's $5500 of abilify chilling out in my thighs. Not counting the worth of my organs (possibly useless because of all the abilify, ironically. I can't donate blood or plasma because of a lifetime ban.)

""Abilify thighs"" should be a legitimate side effect name, because it rhymes and is also amusing. I have gained 40ish pounds mostly due to the abilify and also other meds. Guess where the weight went? My thighs. I needed it though because I was only 100-105 pounds to start with. Now I have a little reserve to fall back on in case I get really physically sick.

I've been thinking about this for a very long time and I'm glad I finally did the math because it really amuses me.

Now if I get the injection in a few days and never get it again, it would take about 15 months or 450 days to get below one milligram remaining. That's assuming the medication doesn't hide out in my fat cells forever; I could imagine because it's lipophilic (literally meaning ""fat loving"") it hides in the fat cells forever and ever. It created the ""abilify thighs"" and now the ""abilify thighs"" preserve it as it plays hide and go seek with my liver. The liver obviously cannot eliminate it as fast as it is entering the body.

1783,Change With Breakup- Need Answers.,schizophrenia,"  This isn't a relationship post, don't worry. Basically, my boyfriend who I was really in love with (blah blah blah) lied to me about having feelings for someone else when he had no reason to not be honest. Since it happened, the voices in my head have been a lot nicer to me. I think they literally killed off that side of me. I feel different now. When I was with him, I became a lot more feminine. I thought I just progressed but in truth I think I was changing for him without realizing. I haven't even been that upset about it other than one time when I was drinking. I think the voices may have some sort of conscience and knew he was no good? Maybe I subconsciously knew and that was my brain's way of warning me? 

  Since it all happened, my voices don't just scream and whisper mean things anymore. They actually have conversations with me and themselves. Its a little distracting, but it's better than before. When I say I feel different, though, I mean I literally feel like a different person. My surroundings and my thoughts even feel different if that makes sense? I remember hearing a voice consciously telling me to rest, and since then, it's like I've been reborn.

1786,Please weigh in on my unmedicated friend's condition,schizophrenia,"A good friend I've had for many years has schizophrenia. Early on she would be depressed, hurt herself, etc. She went to a doctor about 5 years ago when she was around 15, but they said she was too young to be prescribed?

 Anyway, I've helped her stop cutting and check in on her every now and then. Nowadays she seems completely happy and healthy, with a little crafting business where she sculpts the hallucinations she has into things like earrings and trinkets, along with paintings of these like, benevolent beings she sees on occasion. Her art isn't disturbing or red-flaggy at all, just a bit off-kilter, and fairy-like. I believe channeling her psychosis into her art has helped a ton. She seems to be coping with her condition very well and is tremendously kind and caring- one of the best humans I've ever met.

However, I recently saw a YouTube documentary about an unmedicated man suffering from severe schizophrenia, things like communicating with god, believing the CIA was after him, in and out of police stations and mental hospitals, stuff like that. I watched someone who was already pretty wacked out degrade even further until finally it ended with him living on the streets and being hit by a train- an apparent suicide.

I never want this to happen to my friend, ever. The thought of this absolute flower of a human being even possibly ending up like that shatters my heart to think about. I brought it up to her and asked her if she took anything for what she had, but she thanked me and assured me she was fine the way she was and didn't need any medication, that her depression had tapered off and she learned to live with her psychosis- even showed me some nice art she made based off a person she had hallucinated. Given all I know about her, she seems... fine. I want to believe her, and I guess I do. She looks fine, she has a good relationship, a side business, she's never violent or has outbursts of depression or anxiety, all of this of her own accord, unmedicated.

I know this was very long winded and I probably sound foolish with how I've interpreted a lot of this, but I suppose I only want to know one thing.

**Can schizophrenia be left untreated? Or will her condition gradually get worse as she gets older, independent of her coping mechanisms, no matter how fine she seems right now?**

I've of course left her alone about it. But I'm fucking tearing up, and I'm scared. If there's a chance things can go downhill for her, just let me know.

I'm extremely anxious about all this. Last night I experienced something I had only experienced on a lighter scale before. At night, I kept seeing facial patterns on the walls. Like psychedelic facial patterns. These were flashy, but dark. I also had a darkness just envelop me as I shook in bed in fear. My partner came in to the room and saw me in distress and stuff got a lot better after that. I've been seeing more defined shapes in my periphery. I also experienced some thumps in my ears as I heard what I thought to be to very faint whispers.

How do we address this with him in a non confrontational manner? I even have a video of him doing this which I'm thinking of showing to him so he understands his behavior and realizes that we aren't making this up.

1797,Story: Panic attack in prof's office hours,schizophrenia,"edit: i kinda just realized this isn't too interesting of a story

The other day I needed to go to my prof's office hours to go over some ideas I had for my project. I was already dreading going to her office hours because my lack of prereq course knowledge would make her think that I wasn't cut out for the course. I looked at the clock and saw that there were 30 mins left in her office hours so I just got up without a thought to go talk with her. When I got up to her floor I saw another professor from a class that I had skipped 2 times that week so I panicked a little bit and turned the corner and BOOM her office was right there. I just walked in without a thought. Instant regret. I should've composed myself and got my thoughts before I entered, but I didn't. All my stress just unloaded on me. Recent breakup, interviews coming up, I'm stupid because I didn't come into this course with a solid knowledge of the basics, I'm not me (something along the lines of other beings controlling me but idk how to explain it), yada yada yada. I started panicking so bad in her office, and the fact that I was panicking only made me panic more. I was sweating, couldn't breathe, and couldn't speak in complete sentences. I just kept saying sorry to her and she said, ""it's okay, you're okay. I understand - it's that time of the semester."" What an angel. But that made me panic more. Who was I to be in this person's presence taking up their time? For what? God dammit. And I felt like I kept being mean to her. She'd talk about some departmental stuff (which I was actually really interested in) and when I talked I just switched back to staff about my project. Like what the fuck? FUCK. I'm so mad that I was an awkward, stupid, rude, timesucking demon to an absolute angel.

After 30 mins of studdering and not being able to breathe, I told her I was sorry for taking up her time and that I had schizophrenia (hoping it'd explain some of my actions there). The meeting was very helpful for me though because it set me on the right direction for my project. I thanked her and let her know that I'd start coming into office hours more often. Next time I go I'm going to make sure I have a much better foundational knowledge and specific questions I need to ask her.

And honestly, just writing this out stressed me out so I'm going to smoke now.
But quick sidenote I starting seeing a therapist again and I got rediagnosed as schizoaffective :) :). It's been 3 years since I was diagnosed with schizophrenia. Relatively short time, but sometimes I feel like I don't have much more time to live so it who knows!

1802,old friend with schizophrenia thinks I'm stalking them,schizophrenia,"Hello, I had a friend around 2014/2015 who went off their medication for schizophrenia in 2015. I haven't seen them much since then because they moved around a lot. I didn't know them when they weren't medicated, but recently I've been seeing them at a local coffee shop popular for college students in my town. They usually give me a head nod of acknowledgement  because we do have a history though I haven't talked to them in years. I usually just see them briefly and then go along my business. 

Yesterday they confronted me publicly and told me to stop following them. They think I'm lying about being a college student (the café is for students only, they aren't a student but they are the same denomination of the Church that runs it)  and that I go there to stalk them. I don't ever talk to them, usually avoid it because It's awkward seeing old friends, I only see them there maybe once or twice a week, but it's a really busy spot with lots of regulars. They very publicly accused me of following them and lying about my real motives of going there everyday, which is to study. They were scared and also angry that I was lying to them. I think they made it public because they felt there was a safety in numbers if other people knew what I was supposedly doing. They accused me of trying to sleep with their bother who is around 7 years old. 

Before this interaction I haven't spoken to this individual in years. I frequent that café because it's a great study place and they have study rooms but I'm afraid of seeing them again. I don't want to be confronted again but I know they're just scared of being stalked, I'm just 100% not stalking them, and I don't want them to come up to me again and accuse me of sleeping with a 7 year old. Because of this, I am pretty sure they are still off their medication, so ultimate I don't want to scare them.

 Can someone give me some insight of how this individual may be feeling? I don't want them to approach me again so I decided to stop going to that location.  Oh yeah and just incase anyone was wondering I am not self diagnosing them, they told me they were schizophrenic in 2015 when they told me they were deciding to go off their medication.",1,old friend schizophrenia think stalking hello friend around went medication schizophrenia seen much since moved around lot know medicated recently seeing local coffee shop popular college student town usually give head nod acknowledgement history though talked year usually see briefly go along business yesterday confronted publicly told stop following think lying college student café student student denomination church run go stalk ever talk usually avoid awkward seeing old friend see maybe twice week really busy spot lot regular publicly accused following lying real motif going everyday study scared also angry lying think made public felt safety number people knew supposedly accused trying sleep bother around year old interaction spoken individual year frequent café great study place study room afraid seeing want confronted know scared stalked stalking want come accuse sleeping year old pretty sure still medication ultimate want scare someone give insight individual may feeling want approach decided stop going location oh yeah incase anyone wondering self diagnosing told schizophrenic told deciding go medication

1814,Miss my own delusions?,schizophrenia,"I have had symptoms for a couple years now, over the past year I have had some pretty intense delusions that pertained to people I interact with on a daily basis. The delusions made me question them in my mind on a daily basis and stay vigilant. Over the past summer, I abused weed pretty badly which only increased the paranoia and delusions on a daily basis. It took me a while, but I was able to stop weed and my delusions have shrunk, with the paranoia pretty much gone I am now realizing how boring by life actually is.

I have had auditory, visual and tactile hallucinations. I've had auditory hallucinations at night, and when they increased my seroquel dose, they pretty much went away. Only experienced visual hallucinations after smoking weed (I don't do that anymore), and tactile hallucinations happen from time to time.

I think I might be going crazy.. I’m seeing a doctor today..

I don’t really talk much about my severe anxieties because I’m afraid they will lock me up. 

So I lie a lot to my previous doctors to avoid being locked away.. but I think I’m getting worse.

Im terrified of leaving my house, going to the movies, the mall public places.. it scares me, I am scared someone will kill me or hurt me. 

I’m scare if I leave my house I will get into an accident. 

I am convinced there is something out there trying to hurt me I’ve been in deadly car accidents and have had near death experiences

I do have other issues as well, I’m depressed, I don’t want to live some times. I get angry easily. 

But now I feel I’m just becoming worse. I think people are out to get me.. my boyfriend is only with me to torture me. 

No one talks to me, so I think they don’t like me. I have lots of friends on Facebook but no one ever talks to me, so I fee like they are only there to watch me and laugh at me and talk about me. 

When someone’s on the phone around me taking low I get angry because I know for sure they are talking about me

1864,How do you stay focused?,schizophrenia,"One of the biggest problems for me with my schizoaffective disorder is staying focused on things. I get distracted very easily with everything. It takes me 3 times longer to finish anything it feels. Video games are my go to most of the time, but I have trouble even staying focused on them. I will be playing, and get the urge to check Twitter, then to check Reddit, then, oh right, I'm playing a game.   


It is like that with everything though. Having conversations with people, I am not fully focusing on the conversation. I am looking around at things going on around me, looking at the pictures on the walls, looking at just random things. It is one of the reasons why I am taking a break from therapy. My therapy sessions weren't being helpful, because I wasn't talking about anything for enough to really make a difference.   


Is there something that anyone does to help with their focus? Is there maybe a medication that I could ask about? Maybe that wouldn't be a good thing though. I'm already taking quite a few meds.",1,stay focused one biggest problem schizoaffective disorder staying focused thing get distracted easily everything take time longer finish anything feel video game go time trouble even staying focused playing get urge check twitter check reddit oh right playing game like everything though conversation people fully focusing conversation looking around thing going around looking picture wall looking random thing one reason taking break therapy therapy session helpful talking anything enough really make difference something anyone help focus maybe medication could ask maybe good thing though already taking quite med

I have been hospitalized for it and considered a 5151, so you can say that it's bad.  I sometimes feel that people make fun of me in front of my face, but since I am the silent type I can't do anything.  People start saying ""oh that crazy over their"" but the strange part is the feeling that they are making fun of me or talking about me.

I felt very uncomfortable and being me I could not find a way out.  I tried my best to ignore it, but my mental health began to degrade.

  If I begin to talk then what I really want to do is learn the person, see how genuine they are.  I understand this is way too forward and it's not how I should approach a person, but I can't help it, so I figure I will stay quiet.

1873,Likeliness of Schizophrenia,schizophrenia,"A good friend of mine has always been a little off. I've always trumped it to her being her own person, but I recently noticed behavior that made me concerned she may have early on set dementia. She has lived alone a while now as her kids are grown. I haven't spent much time with her in years other than an hour here or there. My husband and kids and I moved in with her temporarily to get away from his family and get a home in a cheaper area. 

Her behavior now:
1.) She was looking for a job in Charlottesville (25 minutes from where we live). The job was at an elderly rehab facility. She stated they would start her ASAP or shortly after and they offered a program to get a CNA. I took her to the second ""interview"" to handle paperwork, etc. She came out and was down. She was confused and very sad. I asked what was wrong. She was in disbelief and very confused. She was saying things like ""I don't know what I was thinking"". She wanted to go sit down and have lunch. She was still very down and couldn't formulate words. She pulled out the contract. It was not an offer letter or employment contract. It was an agreement for nursing classes. She would go to class there three nights a week and could not miss one day or she would owe the money back. She obviously has to work as well, therefore could not commit that much time to this. I asked if they misled her and she said ""no, no. I don't know what I was thinking. They told me. I don't know"". 
2.) My son's birthday - she offered to purchase the pizza as her gift to him. She called me upstairs to give me her card. I went there and she was confused, but got up and said she was going to take care of the pizza. She grabbed her wallet then said ""what was I doing""? I didn't think much of this. I assumed she had just woke up. I reminded her. A moment later, she stopped again and looked at me confused and said ""what are you doing? what do you need?"" completely forgetting not only what she was doing, but that she called me. She had no idea why I was in her room standing in front of her. (This occurred in the evening.)
3.) Husband took her to the gym to see a trainer about her legs. (She is having serious problems with her legs. They are weak and she has difficulty walking. This just came to surface in the last year and is not improving. She is seeing a neurologist and has neuropathy. According to her, the doctor said on a scale of 1-10, her neuropathy is only a 3. She is seeing a psychiatrist. She is seeing an opthalmologist. She seems to be going blind, but denies the seriousness as she does The neuropathy. The trainer refused to see her as she almost fell over in session. They said she needed to do PT. The worker in the gym asked what her driver looked like and the color of the vehicle. Apparently whatever she told the trainer was not the description of the vehicle. Luckily, she asked my husband if he knew her. She said she didn't remember my husband drove her car and described his car. 
4.) Last week, she claimed her job (home for the elderly and disabled) asked her to work a double. She told me she said no. A few days later, she said she needed to go in a 3 for a double. I assumed it changed. She went in and came back ten minutes later and said she wasn't scheduled to work. She was confused and trumped it to bad scheduling and communication. The same happened today and she was texting with coworkers and supervisors. All week she had said they asked her to go in this Saturday at 3 for a double again. She said she told them no. Today, she said she was going to, but her supervisor text her and said ""you are not working a double Saturday. Go look at the schedule at the office."" I took here there and the first thing the worker said was ""What are you doing here?"". Seemed like they were used to her popping up. She went and spoke to the supervisor. She came back agitated which didn't make sense as her schedule did not change at all from the usual, however she told me last night she picked up other days and the supervisor told her that.
5.) Husband took her to an appointment last week at the eye doctor she sees regularly (clearly there's a problem) and waited four hours. She said the woman had labeled her as a no call, no show and they didn't know she was there, so she waited and waited and they saw her. Not sure I buy this. I think some confusion took place. Her appointment was probably on a different day.
6.) She is going back to that same gym tomorrow claiming she now has a physical therapist there after the supposed trainer said they wouldn't see her. She thought this appointment was yesterday, but called them and they told her it was tomorrow instead at 8:00 a.m.
7.) She was looking for a seasoning that was supposedly missing and supposedly found it. Then a week later, she was looking for a seasoning again.
8.) She asked me about a top to a dish that never had a top. I told her when we moved in that it was in the refrigerator with no top and had rice in it, uncovered.
9.) Her house is very messy and in some cases dirty.
10.) She has incontinence and had bowel movements and needs to urinate immediately after eating. She also overeats. Mostly at night. 11.) She misplaces something every day. Literally.
12.) She has never had a license yet has a car that she drives to and from work. She mentioned being in a couple of minor accidents when attempting to go on the highway. She drove into the ditch in one. 
13.) She ""left"" a job a couple of years ago, because she punched someone in the face. (Pretty sure she was fired.)

It seems something neurocognitive is happening. She doesn't realize the memory issues and impairment. She Trump's everything up to her legs as that's visual and noticeable. She is only 57. 

Now...for the confusing part...
She has hummed her entire life nonstop, she makes weird noises everyday. She constantly moans and grunts or says ""ohhhoooohhoo"" over and over. She will be talking then her voice will change into a high pitched, seemingly silly and child like voice. She will say ""yesss, yesss"" over and over in a sing song tone. She changed her voices at other times too, but this one is very repetitive. She will make outrageous noises when playing with my children and get them all rowled up, because they don't know what to make of it. All of this has happened from as long as I or her kids can remember.

I spoke to her daughter who I'm close with and she was also concerned about the memory, then even more so when we connected dots. She and I attempted to talk to one of her brother's, my friend's other son. He dismissed it all as her being exhausted from her job and claimed the legs would improve with PT and getting a new job would help the memory. He then said we need to find her a new job, preferably in Waynesboro and not Charlottesville. He lives in Charlottesville and Charlottesville is the largest city near us. He just doesn't want to drive her around since she is without a license or be bothered with her, yet, he recruited her into one of these Ponzi scheme selling fades with Amway. He got commission on her Joining and she's spending all her money on this nonsense and he has convinced her it's good.

I don't want to confront her as I've tried to hint the legs seem to be a symptom of something bigger and she always claims she just needs PT. Her daughter feels the same as me, but we also want to make sure she is safe as my husband and I will not be here forever to watch after her and all her kids are out of state except the son mentioned above.

1877,Has a doctor ever told you they can't help you?,schizophrenia,"I'm in psych right now (yes, phones are allowed). I took the MMPI test two days ago and aparently scored off the charts on two of the categories. My consistency was good, indicating that I was not lying, but these two categories (I forget what they were called, something like Unusual Criteria) were 100/100, so higher than basically every single person of hundreds of thousands who take this test. My inpatient psychiatrist didn't know what to make of it.

Then today we had a meeting where she told me that I am a VASTLY unusual patient because a) my voices are the most troublesome thing for me (really, I'm the only one?) b) I tend to get slowly worse then rapidly better in the hospital (makes sense to me, the hospital is a triggering environment for me but once I get on the right meds I quickly feel better) and c) meds don't help me (simply not true. I've been helped by many meds and am currently being helped by the Invega and Abilify I'm on). 

It felt like an accusation, like I'm faking my schizophrenia. Right.. Like I come to the hospital for fun. She's also made comments before about how strange it is that my behavior and speech aren't particularly disorganized. 

Basically it came down to her saying that she was going to taper me off all my meds because they're not working (not perfectly, but they fucking ARE!!!) and then she didn't know what to do.

After some back and forth where I confirmed that she actually had no plan and no ideas, I requested to be discharged from the hospital because I am receiving no help here and I see no reason to believe that I will in the future either. I'm not going to live in a hospital bedroom forever for no reason while I receive zero treatment. 

I would be much better served and treated by my outpatient doctor, who still has hope and ideas for me, as well as being near my friends and family. 

She reluctantly agreed under the conditions that we wait a couple of days and conference call with my outpatient psych. I sincerely hope he agrees to this plan because I honestly think the alternative looks grim.

1879,Delusions about your delusions being gone?,schizophrenia,"Hi, relatively new here—I lived with a bipolar I diagnosis for the last 13 years until a few weeks ago when I was re-diagnosed with schizoaffective (bipolar type). For a few years, I'd increasingly been getting psychosis outside of mood episodes, plus negative symptoms. I'm still trying to wrap my head around everything. 

Last week, my pdoc upped my Seroquel XR dose to 600 mg (from 450 mg) to try to knock out the psychosis I was having. Well, it's mostly worked, and the visual hallucinations and original delusions are mostly gone. My head is a lot more quiet than it’s been in years. 

Except...I was fine for a few days, but now I'm finding that I'm developing new delusions/paranoia about them being gone...specifically paranoia that the meds are erasing my brain, that it's all part of a grand plan to ""control"" my mind, that the medicine isn't medicine at all but a way to suppress the “messages” I get, general paranoia about conspiracy..... I'm really suspicious of the meds now. I should say, these all build on the delusions we were trying to get rid of because they are about similar themes, so I feel I’m going round and round in a scary circle.

1895,Feel like I am slipping further down the rabbit hole.,schizophrenia,"Been having a lot of trouble lately, and been feeling myself drifting further down the rabbit hole with everything. I've been making some changes in my life lately, because things were causing me a lot of stress, so I decided to eliminate a lot of those things that were just causing episodes. Things like streaming on Twitch, which was a big part of my life, but I found that I was having more and more episodes while streaming, causing me to have to end early and abrupt.   


I also had to stop going to the therapist that I was going to, because she wasn't helping me at all, and to be honest, it was a wrong fit for me. She had no specialties with schizoaffective disorder, and would sometimes not really even understand why I felt certain ways about certain things. The final straw for me was her telling me to 'man up' about going out and meeting people. I'm still seeing a psychiatrist though, and have been taking my meds.   


I stopped streaming with the intents of creating YouTube videos, because I would be able to do them one my terms. When I would feel stable. Doing the voice work for the videos would probably only take an hour, which I can manage.   


The problem is that I haven't really been able to do anything. Most days I just sleep all day, which my family hates, and most nights I am sitting around playing video games or browsing Twitter or Reddit. I'm scared to sleep during the night, because when I wake up in the middle of the night I see shadow people and orbs bouncing around my room.   


I just feel that I am always just one inch from another episode. Tonight everything is fuzzy and static. I am trying to watch streams, play music, and play video games to try to keep my mind busy and drown out what is going on in my head. I told my psychiatrist this, he pretty much just told me that is just how it is sometimes. I've tried meditation, but, the voices won't let me. I feel that if I fight, they are going to fight back, and if I let them just happen, then that is bad too.   


I just feel so out of control lately. I get distracted very easily. I sleep so much. I am not doing anything with my life. I am not creating anything in any way.

1907,It’s been 2 weeks and I’ve successfully lost 6lbs on Zyprexa!,schizophrenia,"I’ve been eating about 1600-2000 calories a day and working out about 6 hours a week and I’ve successfully lost about 6 lbs on 12.5 mg of Zyprexa.

More realistic picture: I lost 6 lbs in about a week and have been fluctuating around that weight since. But! My clothes are getting looser which tells me I’m burning fat and gaining muscle. I was a tight women’s 12 when I started this and now I’m a really loose 12/ kinda tight 10. My waist went from 33 inches to 31.5 since aug 30th!

What do I eat? No refined carbs and no added sugars. They fuck with your body man. That’s about all the restrictions I have. The rest is just good, whole food. I aim for at least 3 servings of fruit/veg a day and lots of fibre.

What do I do for exercise? I’ve only started exercising over the last 12 days. I’ve done a few yoga classes, weighted yoga classes, barre classes, pilates. I’m introducing swimming this week, and boxing and circuit training next week. Right now I exercise about 10 hours a week, and I’m aiming for 18. Exercises like barre, pilates, yoga are really easy for me because I’m hyper mobile almost everywhere, so I don’t feel like it’s too much. It’s probably too much for A LOT of people, though.

1913,Just feeling lonely and would like,schizophrenia,"Some insight into my personal situation:


1. I live in an apartment in an inner-city area about two hours by public transport. I'm an office worker who works as a professional graphic designer for a large multinational as well as freelance. I am not really able to work all the time because I have a full-time job and two other part time jobs. In my free time, I like to spend more and more time on internet games and to keep my eyes on social media. My work schedule is pretty much like this: 1-6AM, 5-10PM, 1-6AM, 8PM. My daily schedule gives me more free time, because I can spend it on work when it suits me. I usually sleep between 9PM and 3AM, but I've seen people that spend 20-30 hours there.


2. My income is around $7k to $10k per year on my monthly expenses.


3. My expenses are a combination of rent, electricity, phone, food and internet. I don't really spend enough time on anything else these days.. I do enjoy the brief breaks wherein I have a little extra spending money. 

One of those spending money moments is when my son says ""Mom, I want to play football with mom,"" and I say ""That's cool. What do you want to do?"" He's just getting interested, so I take the kids aside, and I say, ""Let's just do it. We're not going on a shopping trip right now, let's just do it.""

Q: When did you start using marijuana?

A: I didn't do it too much. I just used it to light up a cigarette. I really didn't use weed with anyone, but I've been looking for ways to relax. I really believe it opens up the mind. I think weed has had a positive influence on my kids. I think it's been very beneficial to them, and I'm very glad they decided to let me use weed for something other than their parents' pot, rather than their parents' weed. But it hasn't led to anything bad. I've not gotten in trouble, I have not broken the law, I haven't done anything. I haven't done anything you understand, please my children do know what it takes to stay strong as well as fearful.

1914,I don’t know what to do about my brother... I NEED SOME GUIDANCE,schizophrenia,"My older brother was diagnosed in a January with paranoid schizophrenia at the age of of 23. We were getting worried because he would have these random outbursts or just talk to himself all day or at the television. He has zero social anymore. Since January, they had prescribed him Risperidone and Trazadone. He was only taking the meds up until around March then stopped. He kept saying it made him feel drowsy and depressed, like he had no drive to do anything. While he was on them, I could see a huge difference in his appearance and how he talks and expresses himself. He’s a lot more calm and he doesn’t just speak nonsense. It’s too bad he stopped because now he’s kinda the same as before.  The doctors assigned him to a physiatrist that he goes almost once every other week. I haven’t called up to see what they talk about. It’s been 3 months that he’s seeing them. The odd part is, he still doesn’t believe he has schizophrenia. He thinks it’s just sleep problems. I don’t know how to convince. It’s like he thinks I’m out to get him every time I bring it up to him. To make matters worse, my own parents are in complete denial as to how this could happen to him. They blame themselves, they blame the schools, they even blame his friends he used to hang with all the time. They are convinced that he was always like this, like he was always talking to himself, never had friends, and being a poor student. ALL OF THAT IS FALSE. My brother was the guy I looked up to. He was the guy who you play sports with all the time. The guy that all his classmates would say is funniest guy around. This shit doesn’t happen to just about anyone. It’s a rare disorder. And unfortunately my brother was one of the few who got it. I don’t know what the next step should be.

This bout I’ve been having the past week has not been accompanied by seeing anything, though that used to be my main concern in the past. Saw more things, heard less. Now I hear things often. And I know what it is, but it makes me nervous. I misinterpret what people say to something very dire and a threat to me. I feel like everyone hates me. I don’t feel familiar with myself or others that I should feel familiar with. And even the people I trust most, thoughts muscle their way into my head of them doing something to hurt me in some way. I try to be rational, but it’s very hard to think. My head feels cloudy and noisy. Very chaotic and cluttered. I don’t know when this is going to stop. It’s the worst an hour or two after I wake up as the thoughts I disagreed with when I woke up persist and start to make more sense. Then later in the day it dies down leaving me feeling exhausted and sad about how I’ve been thinking all day. It hasn’t been the worst I’ve had, but I thought I was doing better and it’s lasted a while and today is no better than yesterday.

My casemanager said i wasn’t eligible according to the site they use. SO.... i went to that site and found out i was, even the example of psychological disorder said “psychosis and schizophrenia”
Im really angered by this.
Its like my casemanager wants to send me home to that shithole so i have to come back every few months. (Doctor forces a release thursday while im not ready to go back yet).
Ive been ranting to mentally stable friends about this and they say i make a lot of sense so its not that im delusional.
I feel like im better at doing my casemanagers job than my fucking casemanager.

Because 4 hospitalizations caused by shitty living situation is NOT COINCIDENTAL.

Its like somebody wins $10 million dollars in the lottery 3 times a year. People get suspicious and start asking questions at that point.

1928,I tried to live without meds,schizophrenia,"I’ve been five years taking whatever the doctor has given me. And have had some bad experiences with some medications. Before medication I had some weird days but my schizophrenia hadn’t developed yet. Then I went through all the typical onset symptoms with a full psychotic break. I have been on medication ever since my psychotic break. And before I found the right med combo I still had TVs talking to me and hallucinations 

I ended up doing what everyone warned me most schizophrenic people do. I found a med combo that almost erased my symptoms and then thought maybe I was over this illness or had never had it in the first place and that somehow the old medications I was on were causing my hallucinations. I made a choice to withhold my next shot of anti psychotics till I could see how I really was.

.....it went amazing...at first. I had lost the side effects to the shot. Things started coming back like I used to have. Like my sex life was normal again. I became so alert and happy. Even my husband was thinking maybe I didn’t need the meds

I started to get odd.... it started with paranoia of germs especially around the bathroom. I found myself unable to go into the bathroom all together and cleaned it at 3am. Which ok wasn’t normal but it wasn’t that bad either right. Well one day I realized people were cutting trees in my yard. (I latter learned that it was the power company clearing the lines so they didn’t get hurt in a storm or something) but at the time I was so scared to go outside. I called my husband almost ten times in a half hour. I had to go get my daughter from school but I was so scared they would yell at me. I don’t know why. He had to talk to me the whole time while I walked outside. That day I made a new shot appointment, but I didn’t think I actually needed it. I was more scared what people would do when they found out I hadn’t taken the shot. It was a week away and in that week I started to develop all these delusions about the devil and god. It didn’t get really bad till I got into a talk with my husband about how I was this all important going to change the world energy. He listened without saying a word. I don’t even know how long it went on for. Then he decided to call in sick for the last few days I had until my shot. I didn’t know if I was going to take the shot again. I felt this deep connection with the energy of the universe and I was so scared I would loose that. It felt....amazing. I ended up going to my appointment only because I was really scared of what people would say if I fully stopped my meds and I figured if the universe had a message to get to me it would be harder with the meds sure but the universe would find a way. 

My husband came with me and held my hand the whole way. After I got it he just hugged me so tightly I didn’t understand why he seemed so resigned. When I take my shot I get very sick for a few days after and need to sleep it off. He got me back home and in bed. After about a week we started talking about the things I did off medication. I started to accept a truth that my husband already had. I have a serious mental illness and I will be on medication for the rest of my life. The medication changes the way I have to live my life because of side effects. But I need them to be able to stay in this reality. 

I’m thankful for the fact that it was only about 3 weeks off meds. I didn’t destroy anything in my life and my husband didn’t have to step in for me to accept I was going to take another shot. But I feel like I have lost the person I was before I was ever dealing with having a mental illness. Before this experience I always thought it was just a part of me I would pick back up.

1929,How can I connect and communicate with my younger brother?,schizophrenia,"My (27F) little brother (23M) was diagnosed with schizophrenia two years ago. The whole family, myself included, was in denial of that diagnosis for a long time. I think I'm finally on board. 

Do y'all have any tips for communicating, connecting, or otherwise spending time with lil bro? I love him, and we bond over music, but conversations are pretty much impossible. Very little of what he says makes sense or is a coherent thought, and he doesn't talk that much to begin with. As far as I'm aware he doesn't stick to his medication, and is on and off illegal drugs (more off than on lately, so I'm proud of him for that). 

He also will randomly tear up, get really sad, or just non compliant. I want to take him out for meals and stuff but he'll get into strange conversations with strangers and make them uncomfortable. It pisses me off, just play along, he's not going to hurt you. But I can't really blame them when even I can't hold a conversation with him. 

Appreciate any insight!",1,connect communicate younger brother f little brother diagnosed schizophrenia two year ago whole family included denial diagnosis long time think finally board tip communicating connecting otherwise spending time lil bro love bond music conversation pretty much impossible little say make sense coherent thought talk much begin far aware stick medication illegal drug lately proud also randomly tear get really sad non compliant want take meal stuff get strange conversation stranger make uncomfortable piss play along going hurt really blame even hold conversation appreciate insight

1953,wtf do I do if the new roommate has a major mental illness and knowingly refuses to take their medication and her family is little to no help.,schizophrenia,"Ok so I got this new roommate been like a week and about 3 days in she started to talk to herself and a day later she showed me her arm and asked if I had ever woken up with mystery bruises or marks.  So naturally, I sent a text to her sister (only contact I have of hers because the girl cut off the rest of her family because they wanted her to get help) and told her about it (btw I had no idea at the time she was a paranoid schizophrenic not on medication and in denial). And her sister and family knowingly let her move on her own without giving any heads up to me or other roommates about it and we were completely blindsided by it. Her sister originally was very helpful and was like I'll call her doctor and help to get her admitted, now fast forward to 3 days later (roommate is still talking to herself) because the sister was like we need the social worker to come in and see her first, so I waited and took time off from work and class to be here. And later when I questioned the sister on what is happening because I've been here all day she has been giving me the run around all day and finally, I told her I need to know what's going on so I can prepare for it. So she goes and makes it seem like I'm bugging her and making this out to be a bigger deal than it is and tells me, ""I don't have to do this you know"".

So makes us feel super shitty about being concerned about our safety and well-being as well as the new roommates about asking her to help with her sister who at night (2-3am) talks to herself about souls, demons and how some people are demons corrupting regular souls. I believe that the new roommate needs urgent care and this is not something I am able to do or know what to do.

1956,My MIL told my spouse to leave me,schizophrenia,"My mother in law doesn't know my diagnosis has been changed from bipolar disorder to schizoaffective disorder. When my spouse last spoke to her she, spontaneously, told him that if I'm experiencing psychosis at all, in any small amount, they should leave me. They told her that BP often involves psychosis, and they're fine, and they have no intention of leaving me. They're a very honest and open person, and they're very loving. I do believe they're not going to leave me. 

This isn't the first time she's tried to get them to leave me. She asked them for years after I came out as trans when, not if but **when**, they planned to leave me? And encouraged them not to feel guilty for doing so. When she said this at the time I laughed. And, while I deeply trust my spouse (even when I'm psychotic and out of my mind with delusions I trust them) there's something about this time that has deeply shaken me. I think I really do wonder if it would be better for them? And I wonder if my presence in their life is inherently harmful to them. I wonder if she's right. 

I'm doing everything I can to stay on top of my treatment plan. I take my meds, and modulate my dose depending on the presence of additional symptoms. I try to be healthy, I get enough sleep, I manage my stress, I go to therapy, I see my psychiatrist, I socialize. I'm doing everything I can. But I'm scared that it will never be enough and that I will harm and poison everything good in my life. And I wonder now if I should cut off all ties, wander off, and just let everything go. 

I don't normally reach out for help, but I really do need it right now. I don't have anyone I can speak to about it, and I don't see my therapist until the end of the week.

1959,"Expierience with thought broadcasting, intrusive thoughts and voices",schizophrenia,"I thought i write about my experience to see if others might feel the same. My schizophrenia resolves all around my thoughts being heard by others. I never took drugs, it simply started one day. I experience this problem for 9 years now and currently a bad phase is incoming.When a psychotic phase starts i begin to hear voices. I hear them mostly in other sounds. So if someone speaks too far away from me or outside my line of sight i hear them talking about me. When i'm showering i hear voices coming from the running water or in the music i'm listening to. These voices comment negatively on my every move and try to drive me insane with jedi mindtricks. My paranoid delusion tells me it's my neighbors who do this to me, but i don't believe it. I just can't stop the feeling that this is happening and sometimes i lose insight for a few minutes.With the voices intrusive thoughts are happening. They interact with each other and form a downwards spiral that dragged me down a few times and i went off the deep end.

These intrusive thoughts are mostly really bad stuff about everyone who is around me and i fear that i speak every thought out loud, especially my intrusive thoughts. That brings more fears with it. I fear my neighbor will kill me, even if i can't control these thoughts and i mean no harm. I never have seen this guy or know him in any way. My intrusive thoughts include harsh insults, sexual stuff and anything that could hurt me in any way. It's like my brain is suicidal and wants to see me dead.I barely can go outside because this stuff gets so bad and i fear if i meet the wrong person that he could hurt me because of these thoughts.They just happen like a sneeze and the voices react every time and make it even worse. It's a horrible experience when you go outside and everyone is talking about you and these thoughts get loud and out of hand. I just hope people would understand that i don't mean them and i explain so much stuff about it inside my head for them, but they will never hear it. 

Sometimes i hear these thoughts in my environment and i'm not sure if i think them myself. I fear that because of these thoughts my neighbors are out to hurt me and want to drive me insane or make that i leave. Recently loud noises happen every time i lie down on my bed and i think it's them trying to stop me from sleeping.I really don't want this all getting out of hand and i do my best to fight it, but i had no real success with it. I don't really want to bother anyone, i don't care about my neighbors or random people on the street, but these intrusive thoughts want to hurt me every time.When i went to a psychiatric hospital last December i noticed that really no one seemed to know this stuff is going on and  that every time i closed the door of my room i heard anyone on the hallway talking about me. When i opened it they stopped to do that. I asked many people in person if i said anything weird and that they should tell me when i do. No one heard anything and i don't think everyone was keeping that from me. My voices want to gaslight me and drive me crazy and sometimes they get what they want. I really don't know what would help beside medication that never worked for long to stop it. I try to ignore this whole thing happening, but that too only works for so long.

1960,Introducing Myself; Question About Recent Symptoms,schizophrenia,"Hello, everyone. It's taken me ages to actually join reddit. I've been dealing with various little things for years. I was diagnosed with I guess what you'd call nowadays Mayor Depressive Disorder? Or chronic? Idk. This was around...age 14 or 15, I'd like to say. It was a rollercoaster from here on out. I'd go to the teen's psychiatric center, go to group therapy, go home, take my medicine, feel better for a little while, feel terrible afterwards. Y'all have heard this a thousand times. 

Later on, I stopped taking psych meds all together. I decided I didn't want to ""feel like a zombie"" anymore, my exact words. So I stopped. Soon after all my symptoms got worse. My imsomnia worsened and I was losing it. I hadn't been completely suicidal just yet, but when I was 16-17 that all changed. My first suicide attempt was at 16, at a high school friend's party. I won't go into details because I know they can be quite triggering.

I had come out soon after graduating. My conservative, boricua parents weren't too keen on having a queer kid so things only got worse at home. Endless war. I started getting extremely volatile. Seeing shadow people. I wouldn't sleep for days. Hearing different voices that I still hear to this day. I started to think everyone was out to get me and that everyone else read my thoughts. Intrusive thoughts felt more and more violent, strange and alien. Some nights I just couldn't come home due to fear of my parents. Fear of my room and all the times I self-harmed in there, all the sprits I felt lived in there, etc. 

Nowadays, I live with my fiancee. We're planning on moving to either NYC or Chicago in the near future. These things haven't gone away, tbh. Improving my life and going to study abroad helped a lot. I now live in an accepting space with my girlfriend. But I've been getting extremely paranoid lately. Literally feeling like people are going to kill me. People that I know and love...feeling like they're going to poison me or push me down stairs. The shadow people have also come back. Lots of things moving in my peripheral vision. Sometimes just literal tall human-like figures walking in front of me, hovering over me, etc. I hear the voices of friends whom I've never heard shout at me, telling me to off myself or to harm others. I also feel a burning sensation coarsing through my body, most intensely my back, shoulders and face. I'm resilient, I don't give in to commands. All I do is twitch and tell my fiancee ""hey, i'm not really doing too good.."" So idk, i'm just in an odd spot and not sure what to make of what I'm feeling. Not on any psych medication. I was perscribed Risperidone when I talked to my doctor about the burning sensation, muscle twitches and shadow people, but I never started cuz Idk I don't really feel like these symptoms warrant an anti-psychotic. I don't feel like I have psychosis. My grandma has paranoid schizophrenia but she's my only relative who has it.

TL;DR: Hi, new to Reddit. Rollercoaster of a life with a major depressive disorder diagnosis but lately been feeling worse and not knowing what it is I'm feeling. Not on any psych meds, currently. If any of y'all have had experiences similar to these or know more about this, feel free to leave a comment. I'm pretty ignorant when it comes to these issues, especially since it's been years since I've had psychiatric treatment of any kind. 

P.S. the reason I'm asking about this on this subreddit is because I've only recently opened up to certain people about this and some people have told me to seek professional help as they think my symptoms are indicative of psychosis, but I don't think that's the case.

Thank you for your time!

1964,Tapering off of antipsychotic drugs.,schizophrenia,"So from about May to now, I have been tapering off antipsychotic drugs. My doctor was on board with it before, but because of being in college I don't have a doctor to support me now although I have a therapist and will try to find a doc. Basically I was on 234 mg/3 weeks of Invega Sustenna (equivelant to 4 mg risperidone) in May. I did a quick drop of 25% and that was pretty much fine, but once I went down to 156 mg, equivelant to 3 mg of risperidone, it was kind of rough and I was having returning symptoms. But after about one or months, once August came, my body totally adjusted and now the 3 mg dose of risperidone, which I switched to because it is easier to access than the injection and easier to taper, works fine, better than the 4 mg dose in fact.

A couple weeks back I attempted to go down straight to 2 mg, and it wasn't completely unmanageable, but it was just a little bit too rough considering my high demands on me as a student. So in the past 24 hours I have gone down 0.5 to 2.5. The peer-written guides I've seen to taper down all recommend something like 10-25% drop from the original dose every 2-4 weeks, with once reaching the half point, a 10-25% drop of the PREVIOUS month's dose because of the fact that your body has adjusted to the previous dose and it is actually an incredibly drastic drop to continue doing it from the original dose, and because of the difficulty with getting past the very reduced stages of dosing, with high withdrawals.

So basically, no I don't have a doctor, I might try to get one, but no I absolutely don't need one because the majority of doctors are not even trained to take patients OFF meds, and all the information I need has been compiled by peers in withdrawal.theinnercompass.org.

If it is too rough, I will slow down. I'm being careful about it. But can I hear from you guys your experience of slowly tapering off meds, if you have had such an experience, or any recommendations for how to deal with any withdrawal symptoms that may come up while being in school.

And please do not tell me by doing this I will be DoOmEd for the rest of my life and I should just take meds forever and ever until the metabolic symptoms or dementia from it kill me and that I should just listen to a psychiatrist and take whatever pills they want me to. Basically I'm asking you to respect my personal agency to have the freedom of choice as to what drugs I consume and are chemically dependent on.

1981,Schizophrenic brother - fear of violence,schizophrenia,"Hey guys, my brother is possibly schizophrenic and I’m really fearing for my parents life at this point. 

TL;DR - my brother is a 20 year old schizophrenic who is threatening my family and we fear he may become violent. Looking for any experience or advice. 

Backstory: 

He’s a 20 year old male living at home with my parents in TX (I’m his 27 year old sister living in NY) and he had a psychotic episode about 6 months ago. 

He took a knife to my parents furniture, was thrown in jail, institutionalized for 2 weeks and diagnosed as “a possible schizophrenic”. They gave him anti-psychotic medication, but he didn’t stay on it for long. 

He’s confessed to auditory and visual hallucinations, and his desire to kill - but refuses to seek counseling or leave his room at all, other than to eat or walk the dogs. 

Fast-forward to last night. 

My parents have previously stated that he has his good days, and his bad. Last night was bad, and my parents feared for their life, so they called the police at 11 pm. 

An officer came to the house, spoke to my brother who repeatedly told him to “Get the fuck out of my house” ... then pulled a knife out on him. 

The officer said “hey son, please put the knife down, I want to go home to my kids tonight”  and my brother wouldn’t comply until the officer left his room. 

The officer left the home, and did not place my brother under arrest, nor did he, or my parents press charges against my brother. 


My parents now fear for their lives, believe he may have a firearm, and don’t want to provoke him by kicking him out. They say things like  “he might even be the next mass murderer” or  “if anything happens to us, just know it was your brother”.  

They’ve spoken to countless attorneys who have stated that there is nothing they can do, other than to continue calling the authorities. 

They are frustrated, and feel like my bother controls the house. My stepmom is only home on weekends for work - and my dad is there full time, as he is retired. 

I don’t know who to reach out to at this point, since they’ve contact the authorities multiple times and it seems like nothing gets done. They don’t want to provoke him anymore by kicking him out for fear of their own lives. 

I’m hoping someone on here has had similar experiences and can offer some advice.

1982,I'm so fucking tired of people using my illness to exemplify some greater societal trend or psychological theory,schizophrenia,"schizophrenia is a chronic condition caused by brain abnormalities and dysfunction

it isn't something that capitalism or social illness or underlying psychological truth is responsible for (looking at your post-modernists)

even the supposedly great theorists and psychologists seem to have absolutely no idea or conception of what schizophrenia is or what our experiences are

just say things are disconnected or absurd or disorganized. no need to drag us into it.

>[""In the 1960s and 1970s, radical theory and politics (Laing, Foucault, Deleuze and Guattari, etc.) coalesced around extreme mental conditions such as schizophrenia, arguing, for instance, that madness was not a natural, but a political, category.""](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/842089-capitalist-realism-insists-on-treating-mental-health-as-if-it)

many of the post modernists focused on schizophrenia specifically, not just mental illness generally.

>[""This chapter is specifically concerned with the major theoretical works identifying the figure of ‘the schizophrenic’ as representative or typical of the postmodern subject. Although this argument is advanced in an array of different contexts, across a range of disciplines, my analysis concentrates on key texts by Jean Baudrillard, Fredric Jameson, David Harvey, Mark Currie, John Johnston, and Steven Frosh. If, as Robert Barrett suggests, ‘People categorized as “schizophrenic” have long been entrusted with this duty of symbolizing society, its structural elements, its definition of personhood, its contradictions [and] its paradoxes’ (1998c, p. 484), what is distinctive about these theorists’ claim that schizophrenia can be used, however (il)legitimately, to interpret specific aspects of postmodernity?""](https://m.oxfordmedicine.com/mobile/view/10.1093/med/9780199583959.001.0001/med-9780199583959-chapter-006)

the thing that really sucks is that much of post modern philosophy is very compelling to me. generally their critiques of culture and capitalism are useful and insightful. they just wanted so badly for their framework for understanding the modern world to be directly applicable to specific individuals and exemplified in the world that they used anything they could to claim this was so. often it fell upon the mentally ill, most commonly schizophrenics. it just sucks that it wasn't enough for them to have a good critique of the modern world, they had to go and equate social illness with the personal sickness of many individuals.

I think I'm much more exposed to this being a political science major with a focus on philosophy but these narratives were very influential not just in the field of philosophy or sociology but in psychology too. we are still seeing these ideas float around in modern psychiatry.

what triggered this little bout of anger and discontent and hurt one of my philosophy professors teaching these theories and nervously looking at me every so often.
